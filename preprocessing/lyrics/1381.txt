(Luke White on the beat)

[Verse]
You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like a task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot, then bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin', "Fuck it," and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman with many children? Makes you a chump
Look in all the stores you wreckin', nigga, I reckon
Think about the people who own it for 'bout a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a gang, quit violence and grow a pair
But sure, you'd rather hear me say, "Fuck the Black prejudice
Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views," and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion, all cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder opps, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em
Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em, murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say, "Fuck it," and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin', go 'head and grab the extension
Give Death another one, uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' Black

We see, I see, death before the children
White guys and White girls hanging from the buildings (We are the Ku Klux Klan, we hate)256Embed
