I watched the sun again, it's leaving now
I've spent all night long, trying to figure out
What I've lost and what I've found
When my feet won't hit the ground
Trying to make it, starting over
And will we ever love again?

[Chorus]
Hey baby, are you alone tonight?
How can we make it?
Hey baby, looks like you were wrong
It's never too late, too late

[Verse 2]
So here we are again, to make some sense of it all
All these sudden changes
Maybe things are not so different
Re-arranging pieces like it's all we know
It's all we know, letting go

[Chorus]
Hey baby, are you alone tonight?
How can we make it?
Hey baby, looks like you were wrong
It's never too late, too late
You might also like[Verse 3]
I keep putting together, what we've lost
But pieces keep falling one by one
Cause this life has us holding on
For tomorrow then it's gone
For tomorrow then I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey baby, it looks like you were wrong
How can we make it?

[Chorus]
Hey baby, are you alone tonight?
How can we make it?
Hey baby, looks like you were wrong
It's never too late, too late

[Bridge]
And we'll take it all (Hey, baby)
Leave the rest behind
There's no one else, tonight, tonight

And we'll take it all (Hey, baby)
Leave the rest behind
There's no one else, tonight, tonight7Embed Hey Baby, Here's That Song You Wanted Witness blessthefall metalcore
