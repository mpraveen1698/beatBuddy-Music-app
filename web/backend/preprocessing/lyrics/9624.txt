9 ContributorsVisions Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got a vision so clear in my head
It's a strange kind of prison
It is and it isn't

[Verse 2]
It's the life that I'm bound to live
Without ever knowing why
It's the beauty of the morning
It's the soft line of your thigh

[Verse 3]
It's the day that I found your note
As I walked along the shore
I read the lines you wrote
Left hidden in my coat

[Chorus]
It's the truth
It's the truth
And it's a lie

[Verse 4]
She loved to be alone, alone
To feel the shape of herself at home
That could not be known
Like a stranger on the street
Whose eyes you fail to meet
You might also like[Verse 5]
He loved to be alone, alone
To feel the limits of his hours blown
Scattered and thrown
Like on a windy day
All meaning cast away

[Chorus]
It's the truth
It's the truth
And it's a lie2Embed Visions If I Am Only My Thoughts Loving garage
