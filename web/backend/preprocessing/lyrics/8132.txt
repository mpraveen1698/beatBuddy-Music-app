[Verse 1]
Never thought that you would be
Standing here so close to me
There's so much I feel that I should say
But words can wait until some other day

[Verse 2]
Kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It’s been a long, long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear
Since I can't remember when
It’s been a long, long time

[Verse 3]
You'll never know how many dreams
I've dreamed about you
Or just how empty they all seemed without you
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
