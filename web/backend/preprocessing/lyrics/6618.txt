It always starts with a "Hey"
Turns into "How was your day?" (How was your day?)
Turns into "Meet at my place"
Turns into you and me drinking rosé
Turns into "How did you sleep?" (How did you sleep?)
Turns into "It's been a week" (A week)
Turns into gave you a key (Key)
Turns into conversations talking 'bout "What are we?"
I found a thing when I wasn't even looking for a thing
I keep thinking about it in my brain

[Chorus]
How I'm 'posed to know how deep? (How deep)
How I'm 'posed to know how deep I'd fall?
Stuck up in my arm, IV
Didn't mean to take that leap, my fault
How I'm 'posed to know how deep? (How deep)
How I'm 'posed to know how deep I'd fall?
How'd you make my heart skip beats? (Skip beats)
Didn't mean to take that leap, my fault

[Verse 2]
I ain't saying I ain't into this (Yeah)
I'm thinking we could slow it down a little bit (What?)
In your place, but I'm feeling like I live in it (Live in it)
Butterflies in your stomach, got you giggling (Got you)
"Can you really see us together?" I think so
"Are you going to love me forever?" I don't know
Girl, if it was up to me, I'd take a time machine
Come back and tell you exactly where this goes

How I'm 'posed to know how deep I'd fall?
Stuck up in my arm, IV (IV)
Didn't mean to take that leap, my fault
How I'm 'posed to know how deep? (How deep)
How I'm 'posed to know how deep I'd fall?
How'd you make my heart skip beats? (Skip beats)
Didn't mean to take that leap, my fault

My fault
Yeah (It's my fault)

It's my fault, babe
It's my fault
