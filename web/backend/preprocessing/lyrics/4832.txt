4 ContributorsComing for You - Freestyle Lyrics[Intro: Nick Furlong]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die (Good job, Sho)
My father told me

[Chorus]
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you

[Open Verse]
