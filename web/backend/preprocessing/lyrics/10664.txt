1 ContributorHow Do You Dress for the Rain? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Make it hard, make it easy
Either way, let me know
'Cause I would fight if you ask me
Or give you space, let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
When I come close to giving in
You call me, make it feel like it always did
I keep waiting for the sky to fall apart

[Chorus]
How do you dress for the rain?
How do you brace for the pain
Of a heart not fully broken?
How do you ask her to stay?
How do you know to walk away
When the words are left unspoken?

[Verse 2]
Make it hurt, say you miss me
See if I'm still hanging on
Play it safe and keep your distance
'Cause you know that you're not coming home

[Pre-Chorus]
When I come close to giving in
You call me, make it feel likе it always did
I keep waiting for the sky to fall apart

How do you dress for the rain?
How do you bracе for the pain
Of a heart not fully broken?
How do you ask her to stay?
How do you know to walk away
When the words are left unspoken?

[Outro]
How do you, how do you
How do you, how do you
How do you dress for the rain?
How do you, how do you
How do you, how do you
How do you dress for the rain?Embed How Do You Dress for the Rain? How Do You Dress for the Rain? Sam MacPherson songwriter
