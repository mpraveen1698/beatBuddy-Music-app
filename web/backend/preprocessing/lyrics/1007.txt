Mrs. Magic to and fro
Please give me one last show
Loosen my mind from within
Before it starts to wear and thin

[Chorus]
I don't know
I don't know what I'm doing here
I don't know
I don't know what I'm doing here
[Verse 2]
Mrs. Magic radio
Give me one last chance to show
Tell you what lurks deep inside
Deep inside my battered mind

[Chorus]
I don't know
I don't know what I'm doing here
I don't know
I don't know what I'm doing here

[Bridge]
Leaving me outside
No, I can't get back in
No, I can't get back in
Leaving me outside
No, I can't get back in
No, I can't get back in, ooh
