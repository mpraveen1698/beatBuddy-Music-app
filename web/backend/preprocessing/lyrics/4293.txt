20 ContributorsRevolution Lyrics[Intro]
All my wolves begin to howl
Wake me up, the time is now
(O-oh) Can you hear the drumming?
(O-oh) There's a revolution coming!

[Verse 1]
Wide awake, the fever burns
Sweat it out, wait my turn
(Can you hear the drumming?)
(There's a revolution coming!)
All this doubt is creepin' in
Inside out, I shed my skin
(Can you hear the drumming?)
(There's a revolution coming)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I been waitin' all my life
To live, when I've only been dreaming
Get love when I've only been stealing
Can't let time keep passing me by
Run down what I've always been chasin'
Black out every fear I've been facin'

[Chorus]
All my wolves begin to howl
Wake me up, the time is now
(O-oh) Can you hear the drumming?
(O-oh) There's a revolution coming!
Wild things that turn me on
Drag my dark into the dawn
(O-oh) Can you hear the drumming?
(O-oh) There's a revolution coming!
You might also like[Verse 2]
Body aches, I'm bound in chains
But there's a fire in my veins, yeah
(Can you hear the drumming?)
(There's a revolution coming!)
Like every king who lost a crown
And all those years are history now
(Can you hear the drumming?)
(There's a revolution coming!)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I been waitin' all my life
Run down what I've always been chasin'
Black out every fear I've been facin' (Facin')

[Chorus]
All my wolves begin to howl
Wake me up, the time is now
(O-oh) Can you hear the drumming?
(O-oh) There's a revolution coming!
Wild things that turn me on
Drag my dark into the dawn
(O-oh) Can you hear the drumming?
(O-oh) There's a revolution coming!

[Post-Chorus]
There's a revolution coming!
There's a revolution coming!
(O-oh) Can you hear the drumming?
(O-oh) There's a revolution coming!
[Bridge]
I'm rising up, up from the ground
From the bottom, can't hold me down, hold me down
I'm rising up, up from the ground
From the bottom, can't hold me down, hold me down
Hold me down (Down, down, down, down, down)

[Chorus]
All my wolves begin to howl
Wake me up, the time is now
(O-oh) Can you hear the drumming?
(O-oh) There's a revolution coming!
Wild things that turn me on
Drag my dark into the dawn
(O-oh) Can you hear the drumming?
(O-oh) There's a revolution coming!

[Post-Chorus]
There's a revolution coming!
There's a revolution coming!
(O-oh) Can you hear the drumming?
(O-oh) There's a revolution coming!
There's a revolution coming!
There's a revolution coming!
(O-oh) Can you hear the drumming?
(O-oh) There's a revolution coming!10Embed Revolution ATLAS The Score alternative
