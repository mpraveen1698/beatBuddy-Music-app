Die!

[Verse 1]
I don't need your forgiveness
I don't need your hate
I don't need your acceptance
So what should I do?
I don't need your resistance
I don't need your prayers
I don't need no religion
I don't need a thing from you!

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't do what I've been told
You're so lame, why don't you just go

[Chorus]
Die Motherfucker, die Motherfucker die
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die

[Verse 2]
I don't need your prison
I don't need your pain
I don't need your decision
So what should I do?
I don't need your approval
I don't need your hope
I don't need your lecture
Run away, away
I don't need a thing from you!

Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die

Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die!

[Bridge]
I don't need your forgiveness
I don't need your hate
I don't need your acceptance
So what should I do?
I'll be sorry so you've said
Well I'm not sorry
Bang you're dead

[Chorus]
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die
Die Motherfucker die Motherfucker die
