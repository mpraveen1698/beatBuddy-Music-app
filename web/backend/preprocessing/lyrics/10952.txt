39 ContributorsSeasons Lyrics[Verse 1]
The seasons come and go like thoughts of you
Like a wave returns to the sea into the blue
They change but in a cycle that I can't lose
Each painful but delightful to live through

[Chorus]
You came into my life just like another season
Not for long just a time, just like another season
Maybe this time next year you'll reappear for unknown reason
But I'll cherish everyday, 'till you come my way this season

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
The seasons turn and change just like your mind
Like the sun gives into the moon into the night
Time continues marching, it slowly crawls
With each new one starting I recall
Woah

[Chorus]
You came into my life just like another season
Not for long just a time, just like another season
Maybe this time next year you'll reappear for no reason
But I'll cherish everyday, 'till you come my way this season

Oh
Oh, this season, yeah
Oh, this season, yeah

[Verse 3]
Each time of year carries memories
Like a never fading whisper in the breeze
Oh, we will keep on changing all over again
Yeah, we will keep on changing just like another season

[Drop]
Don't want another day without you by my side, oh this season
Oh, this season, yeah
You came into my life, just like another season
Not for long just a time, just like another season

[Outro]
Just like another season
Just like another season9Embed Seasons Seasons Rival;Cadmium;Harley Bird edm
