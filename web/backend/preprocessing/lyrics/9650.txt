5 ContributorsPerfect Lyrics[Verse 1]
Always running on the move
Ain't a thing we couldn't do
Oooooh, oooh
Sippin' liquor after school
Paper bags to hide the booze
Oooooh

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll make it I swear
'Cause we're halfway there
So let me take it, take it all the way
With my heart on my sleeve
In all honesty
There's something that I gotta gotta say

[Chorus]
Maybe I don't deserve it
But I'll give you all I got and I'll make it worth it
Rely on me and baby you won't be nervous
'Cause if we give it a shot then we could be perfect

[Verse 2]
Making sure nobody knew
Trouble that we got into
Oooooh, oooh
Skinny dipping in the pool
Breaking all our made-up rules
Ooooh
