Out here
Barely see my breath
Surrounded
By jealousy and death
I can't be reached
Only had one call
Dragged underneath
Separate from you all
You all

[Verse 2]
This time
Lost my own return
In spite of
Everything I've learned
I hid my tracks
Spit out all my air
Slipped into cracks
Stripped of all my cares
My cares

[Verse 3]
I'm so tired
Sheep are counting me
No more struggle
No more energy
No more patient
You can write that down
It's all too crazy
I'm not sticking 'roundYou might also like25Embed I'm So Tired Instrument Soundtrack Fugazi punk
