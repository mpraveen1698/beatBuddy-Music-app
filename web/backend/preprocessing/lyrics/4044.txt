4 ContributorsToo Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl, you’re a river
Of healing
I was certain that I wouldn’t last
And you are the answer
To questions
That I didn’t know my soul was asking

[Pre-Chorus]
My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you’re the brightest thing in my life

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center, you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine

[Verse 2]
I have been broken
And beaten
Yeah, the world knows how to break you down
But when pain blurs my vision
I won't worry
Because you always turn it back around
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center, you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center, you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine1Embed Too Good Borderline Christian Kuria chill
