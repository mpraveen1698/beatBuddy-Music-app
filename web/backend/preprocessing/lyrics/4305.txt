Go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
(Great John on the beat by the way)

[Verse: Sleepy Hallow]
My body different
Shorty said she tryna kick it
I'm in her mouth, somethin' like a dentist
Cookin' up, I'm in the kitchen
Big bro wildin', tryna catch a victim
I took an L, but now I'm back, gang winnin'
Look, and I'm doin' well
Don't even ask how I'm livin' (Facts)
Niggas ain't real, they cap (Cap)
Ridin' round with the seat laid back
They told me to chill, I'm itchin' to clap
If I pull up, somebody get whacked
Boy, tie your laces, niggas tripping
Red lights, we gon' skip it
Fucked up a new V, we was dippin'
From the police, I was drillin'
But fuck it, let's skate on, huh
Run up a bag with my bro gods, huh (Bro)
Watch how I show off
Step in the room and she takin' her clothes off
I ain't even say much, huh
Ain't even do much
They like, "Sleepy, you too much"
Know I got a bag, right? Huh
Know I live a fast life
Said she fell in love, met her last night, huh
Said she want this shit for life
Girl, you must be dumb, no, you not the type, huh (What?)
No, I'm not the type
I think I was lost in a past life
Came back, got my cash right
Say you want the sauce, I can get you right
But it's heavyweight, not light (Hold up, hold up)
Bro keep a strap, somethin' like a dyke
He be shootin', he don't like to fight
I could get you wrapped up like a gift
Smoked up like a spliff
Chopper tell 'em back up or get hit
Got my racks up, now I'm lit
I could get you packed up in this bitch
And my blood blue 'cause I'm Crip
Fanny pack full of hundreds (That's a fact)
I just reach on my waist, seen he runnin' (Fuck outta here)
Bitches say a nigga stuntin', huh (Nigga stuntin')
Know they hate how I came up from nothin'
Backed down, get to drummin' (Baow, baow)
I'ma show a nigga how I'm comin'
I was down, now I'm uppin' (Now I'm up)
They was hatin' on me, now they lovin' (Oh wait, hold on)
