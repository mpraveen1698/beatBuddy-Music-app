I'm fifteen for a moment
Caught in between ten and twenty
And I'm just dreamin'
Countin' the ways to where you are
I'm twenty-two for a moment
And she feels better than ever
And we're on fire
Makin' our way back from Mars

[Chorus]
Fifteen, there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose
Fifteen
There's never a wish better than this
When you only got a hundred years to live

[Verse 2]
I'm thirty-three for a moment
I'm still the man, but you see, I'm a they
A kid on the way, babe
A family on my mind
I'm forty-five for a moment
The sea is high
And I'm headin' into a crisis
Chasin' the years of my life

Fifteen, there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose yourself within a mornin' star
Fifteen, I'm all right with you
Fifteen
There's never a wish better than this
When you've only got a hundred years to live

[Bridge]
Half time goes by, suddenly you're wise
Another blink of an eye, sixty-seven is gone
The sun is getting high, we're moving on...

[Verse 3]
I'm ninety-nine for a moment
And dyin' for just another moment
And I'm just dreamin'
Countin' the ways to where you are

[Breakdown]
Fifteen, there's still time for you
Twenty-two, I feel her too
Thirty-three, you're on your way
Every day's a new day
Ooh-ooh, who, ooh-who-who
Ooh-ooh, who, ooh-who-who
Ooh-ooh, who, ooh-who-who, who-who-who
[Chorus]
Fifteen, there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to choose, hey fifteen
There's never a wish better than this
When you've only got a hundred years to live12Embed 100 Years The Battle for Everything Five For Fighting piano
