I wanna feel hope when I die
So I know what I left behind
I wanna feel peace when I rest
So I know that I passed love's test
Oh, so I know that I passed love’s test

[Chorus]
And I always want hope
But with you, I never get bored
So wake me up in five
I'll walk the dog, you stay inside

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna feel alone when I sleep
Heavy chest, I’m tryna breathe
Don't rob me from what I might need
Joyful mind in the breeze

[Chorus 2]
And I will drive the whole way back
You can rest assured that
Tear apart the divide
Strawberry fields in my mind

[Outro]
I wanna feel hope when I die
So I know what I left behind
I wanna feel peace when I rest
So I know that I passed love's test
Oh, so I know that I passed love's testYou might also like1Embed Hope Ode to a Friend Old Sea Brigade folk
