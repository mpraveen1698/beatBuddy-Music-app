With your mouth and body
And your hands
Don’t you know I love you?
I’m at your command

[Chorus]
Pleasure
It’s all I ever wanted, it’s all I ever needed to take me home
Pleasure
You can find it anywhere
Paris, Italy, and Rome
Pleasure

[Verse]
Lingerie and satin
What a bed
Jacuzzi sunshine lavender, orange, and red

[Chorus]
Pleasure
It’s all I ever wanted, it’s all I ever needed to take me home
Pleasure
You can find it anywhere
Paris, Italy, and Rome

Pleasure blows your mind
Pleasure is so divine
Pleasure takes you there
Way up in the air
Everywhere is there

[Chorus]
Pleasure
It’s all I ever wanted, it’s all I ever needed to take me home
Pleasure
You can find it anywhere
Paris, Italy, and Rome
Pleasure

With your mouth and body
