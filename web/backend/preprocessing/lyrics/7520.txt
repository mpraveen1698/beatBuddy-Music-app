1 ContributorAlways be my baby Lyrics[Verse 1]
We were as one babe
For a moment in time
It seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'm letting you fly
Cause I know in my heart babe
Our love will never die

[Chorus]
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Oh don't you know you can't escape me
Oh darling you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time cannot erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Oh darling you'll always be my baby

[Verse 2]
I ain't gonna cry no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave just know
I will not stand in your way
But in effort to be
You'll be back again
Cause you know in your heart babe
Our love will never end, no
You might also like[Chorus]
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Oh don't you know you can't escape me
Oh darling you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time cannot erase a feeling this strong, no
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Oh darling you'll always be my baby

(Vocals)
Oh yeah
Yeah

[Outro]
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Oh don't you know you can't escape me
Oh darling you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time cannot erase a feeling this strong, no
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Oh darling you'll always be my babyEmbed Always Be My Baby Covers Tim Halperin acoustic
