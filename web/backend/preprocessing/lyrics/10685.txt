I can feel the world get farther
Every year the stars get darker
Running out of time, we don't got much left
We can fall in love with our final breath
(On and on, stay with me)
I can feel the world move slower
(Watch the sky patiently)
I can see the trees grow older
(On and on, stay with me)
If you stay with me you can have my warmth
(Watch the sky patiently)
Watch it all end laying on my porch
Watch it all end, just hold on tight (tight)
Wake up in my arms on the other side (side) (Be alright)
Yeah, think of me when you close your eyes

[Bridge: Powfu]
Close your eyes
I know nothing
Something about you

[Verse 1: Powfu]
Feeling like ice, when you touch me I can't move (can't move)
You're the reason why I smile while I'm falling to my doom
When you touch me I can't move (can't move)
You're the reason why I smile while I'm falling to my doom
Watching meteors
But I feel secure
Clouds are pouring rain
But the world's in flames
Buildings falling down
Chaos all around
But with you I'm safe
You're my getaway

2012 was a mess in the end
Felt like a car crash in a Benz
This time it's happening
Last song, I don't think I'll ever rap again
Flashing lights, I hear the sirens
By my side, where you residing
That's fine, yeah
Wanna open my eyes
But I can't tell if I'm still alive, wow
Last year on the Earth was amazing
Final verse for the ones that are waiting
Crossing over, wonder where I'm headed
Hope I'll see you soon when I'm up in heaven, yeah
When I get there
Can we meet up?
Let the light talk
Kick our feet up
Back then I faced every fear
Tried to keep you safe when our end was near

[Chorus: Powfu]
I can feel the world get farther
Every year the stars get darker
Running out of time, we don't got much left
We can fall in love with our final—
(On and on, stay with me)
I can feel the world move slower
(Watch the sky patiently)
I can see the trees grow older
(On and on, stay with me)
If you stay with me you can have my warmth
(Watch the sky patiently)
Watch it all end laying on my porch
Watch it all end, just hold on tight (tight)
Wake up in my arms on the other side (side) (Be alright)
Yeah, think of me when you close your eyes7Embed Laying on my porch while we watch the world end. Laying on my porch while we watch the world end. Powfu;Rxseboy;Slipfunc sad
