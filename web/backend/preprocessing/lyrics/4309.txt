(Ghosty)
Catch one of y'all niggas slipping out here, nigga
It's gon' be murder, nigga, word to my mama, nigga
Hoodie on, mask on, strap drawn, tried to run, he ain't get that far
Fishbowl try to spin that block, gang gang gon' Swiss that car
Kill a opp broad day, get blasted, lawyer gon' spank that charge
Hangin' out all black Suburbans, Blicky gon' hit that target

[Chorus]
Hoodie on, mask on, strap drawn, tried to run, he ain't get that far (Come here)
Fishbowl try to spin that block, gang gang gon' Swiss that car
Kill a opp broad day, get blasted, lawyer gon' spank that charge (Gang, gang, gang)
Hangin' out all black Suburbans, Blicky gon' hit that target

[Verse 1]
Whole lotta shots, knock his face off
Spin through, hang out the roof with a Draco
Back from the Yams and the case closed
Blood on my kicks, that's from stomping his face off
Chop off a limb with a chainsaw (Come here)
No cap, I'm in the booth with a bankroll (Bankroll)
Stuffin' the clip, a whole trey-O
He ain't gon' shoot, why the fuck is he gang for?
Run up on Fetty, catch Fetty, that's Fetty (Come here)
Countin' hella bands, Swing chase that zelly (Pussy)
Henny on Henny on Henny on Henny
Gang in the spot, get deady on deady
Bustin' a 40, spin on your shawty, don't do Bacardi (Don't do Bacardi)
Bust your piñata, open your māthā, shoot up the party (Māthā, māthā)
Fuck it, we live, chair to the head, get beat up like Mauley (Beat up like Mauley)
If I'm not on the H, then I'm in the Fields or I'm up in Garvey
Thirty clip, that mean hella bodies (Hella bodies)
Spin your hood and kill anybody (Anybody)
If he missing, the medics got him
He ain't dead, but we paralyzed him (Paralyzed him)
You might also like[Chorus]
Hoodie on, mask on, strap drawn, tried to run, he ain't get that far (Come here)
Fishbowl try to spin that block, gang gang gon' Swiss that car
Kill a opp broad day, get blasted, lawyer gon' spank that charge (Gang, gang, gang)
Hangin' out all black Suburbans, Blicky gon' hit that target

[Verse 2]
Getting money off the zelly
In and out her like a deli
Free that nigga Skrelly
Put a bullet in his belly
BnB, so fuck a telly
Fucking up a shot
We don't do the jumpin' (Nah)
Shotgun start to pumpin'
See him slipping, I'ma dump it (Gang, gang, gang)
Kill a nigga, then we dump him
Throw his body in a dumpster
Spin through like ayy
He moving wock, he get shot in the face (Ayy, ayy)
I heard they droppin' the rakes (Huh?)
But we got the addy and we on the way
Swervin', lurkin', slippin', murk 'em
Purge with burners, it's a murder (Gang, gang, nigga)
Hearse him, put him in the dirt
They got his face prints on a shirt
Hop out, strap drawn, head tap, tried to run, he ain't get that far (He ain't get that far)
Spin through, two shooters, one driver, we gon' kill that boy (We gon' kill that boy)
We gon' bend that block, we gon', you gon' hear that noise (You gon' hear that shit)
All we know is dead opps, no attempts at leg shots, hit him in his headtop (Kill that nigga)
[Chorus]
Hoodie on, mask on, strap drawn, tried to run, he ain't get that far (Come here)
Fishbowl try to spin that block, gang gang gon' Swiss that car
Kill a opp broad day, get blasted, lawyer gon' spank that charge (Gang, gang, gang)
Hangin' out all black Suburbans, Blicky gon' hit that target
Hoodie on, mask on, strap drawn, tried to run, he ain't get that far (Come here)
Fishbowl try to spin that block, gang gang gon' Swiss that car
Kill a opp broad day, get blasted, lawyer gon' spank that charge (Gang, gang, gang)
Hangin' out all black Suburbans, Blicky gon' hit that target

[Outro]
