Sing, me a sad song
Top of the morning too
By the catacombs
You and I, it's do or die
Skies are grey, so you flew a kite
We knew
And I'll take
My lifetime, better days
I won't awake
And I know

[Bridge]
You, I, we die
It's so hard to take
This time, I'll fly
We won't ever break
It's all I know
You can't ever say (Say, no)
You, I, we die
It's so hard to take
This time, I'll fly
We won't ever break
It's all I know
You can't ever say (Say, no)

The end just never comes, ooh-ah
End just never comes, ooh-ah
End just never comes, ooh-ah
The end just never comes, ooh-ah
End just never comes, ooh-ah
End just never comes, ooh-ah
