4 ContributorsLife Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, daddy taught me how to throw a curveball
The summer I turned thirteen
And first base, first taste of findin' a song on my old six-string

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I'd known then what I know now
Yeah, I guess we all do
It wasn't very long 'fore I found out life throws a pretty mean curveball too

[Chorus]
It'll get you high
It'll get you low
That's just life
And how it goes

[Verse 2]
Well, daddy was gone by the time that
I felt my first heartbreak
And good Lord, that good Lord sure can give, and sure can take

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I'd known then what I know now
I guess we all do
Now there's pictures on the wall, up and down the hall
Of me and hеr sayin', "I do"
You might also like[Chorus]
It'll get you high
It'll get you low
That's just life
And how it goеs

[Post-Chorus]
It's blessin's and burdens
And lessons and learnin'
And playin' and workin'
And healin' and hurtin'
It's prayin' and cursin'
One thing's for certain
That's just life
Yeah, that's just life
That's just life
Yeah, that's just life

[Bridge]
The smiles, the laughs
The tears will flow
The good, the bad
Will pass as sure as the sun comin' up in the mornin'
The sun's comin' up in the mornin'
So love and live, and take it slow
No matter where you're at, just know
That the sun's comin' up in the mornin'
That's just life
Yeah, that's just life
That's just life
Yeah, that's just life
[Chorus]
It'll get you high
It'll get you low
That's just life
And how it goes

[Post-Chorus]
It's blessin's and burdens
And lessons and learnin'
And playin' and workin'
And healin' and hurtin'
It's prayin' and cursin'
One thing's for certain
That's just life
Yeah, that's just life
That's just life
Yeah, that's just life

[Outro]
Some things you can't change
Some things you can't explain
You gotta give it to the lord
That's just life
Yeah, that's just life
Some things you can't change
Some things you can't explain
You gotta give it to the lord
That's just life
Yeah, that's just lifeEmbed Life Life Florida Georgia Line country
