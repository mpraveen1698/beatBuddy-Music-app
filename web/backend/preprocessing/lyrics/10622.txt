Skankin', groovin', hallelujah
Skankin', groovin, help me Jah Jah
Skankin', groovin', under pressure
Skankin', groovin'

[Verse 1]
Under the pressures of life and it tough
Nuh stay down mama, time fi get up
Nuh bother with the downful style, strictly upful vibes and pick it up
When the bills dem, the rent and the mortgage due (weh' mi chalice)
When your best friends are gone and it's only you
Light up a spliff turn up the music

[Chorus]
Skankin' sweet - everybody wanna feel irie
Forget your troubles and rock with me
You nuh feel how reggae music sweet, yeah-e-yeah
Skankin' sweet - everybody wanna feel irie
Forget your troubles and rock with me
You nuh feel how reggae music sweet, yeah-e-yeah
Skankin' sweet

[Verse 2]
For every pain there's a melody, yeah
For every trouble there's a harmony
That brings everything together
So make we sing together
And who say life nuh hard
And every man got their struggle
I begging you help me lord
Let me overcome my trouble
