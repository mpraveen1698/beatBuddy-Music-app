"Hey, sorry I missed your call, just leave a message after the beep"
"Hey, yeah, it's me, just been thinking about everything tonight
And I don't know, I just miss you so much
Give me a call back if you can?"

[Verse 1: Hillary Scott]
Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

[Chorus: Hillary Scott]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

[Verse 2: Charles Kelley]
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

[Chorus: Hilary Scott]
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
Whoa, oh

[Bridge: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley]
I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

[Chorus: Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley & Lady A]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

[Outro: Hillary Scott with Charles Kelley & Hillary Scott]
I just need you now
Oh baby, I need you now39Embed Need You Now Need You Now Lady A country
