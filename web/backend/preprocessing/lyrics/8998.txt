1 ContributorNew Jerzey Drive Lyrics[Intro: Bad Lungz]

Oh yeah nigga
This shit 'bout to get fucking epic
New Jerzey Drive shit
Haha
Uhuh come ride with me

[Verse 1: Bad Lungz]
I'm not attached to the numbers as long as the record's felt
Rhyming on what I produce, I guess I'm talking to myself
Niggas is wearing kelps no wonder you skrrttt skrttt on ya adlibs
I was happier when I was broke, now I'm tryna be mad rich
Ignant ain't it I just paint it on the canvas
Keep on whipping grits, hot sauce on my catfish
Touch deep in your soul  like [?]
I'm a chubby nigga but the money make me attractive
Brims and Tim's, thugging hoes, call it a hat trick
I spit fire when it's friction call it a matchstick
I'm entrenched in this rap shit by all facets
Now I'm tryna hedgе my bets and double all my assets
Who am I? A rеflection of the most high
But I don't subscribe to the same beliefs as priests and catholics
You niggas average at best, all I see is food
They got scared when they put me in here like gorilla glue
Niggas is jacking waves camping and stealing grooves
She took a tab and did a dab with a thriller move
The [?] of my residence is like duda man's impediment selection About medicine
Gettin' G money no evidence is evident, my tenant is
Like flying to my penmanship, amongst giants some ghetto men
My word play is heaven sent but when I play with words I let the devil in
Mario, Luigi when I'm bored yeah that's my bit
It's a wild game cooking gator with limone, just a hint
You ain't on the same type of shit that we on
Which is big pen I'm Sydney Gilpin, know this renaissance
New Jerzey drive going nutty in a stolen car
Had to fiend singing for rock like Pat Benetal
After your law, I put it together and find the flaw
From fat farming with my boot camp, the [?] the [?]
My dialect is ice cold like it's Chippewa
And I still drop clues and jewels like a synagogue
I'm not attached to the numbers as long as the record's felt
Everybody know that good dope gonna sell itself
