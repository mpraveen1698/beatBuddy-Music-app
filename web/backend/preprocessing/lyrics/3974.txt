Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone

[Verse 1]
What a shame, what a shame, what a shame
It's all fun and games 'til you don't wanna play now
Run away, run away, run away
It's easy to see but it's harder to say now

[Pre-Chorus]
You're on to something else
I'm a picture left on your shelf
The dream's a lie, I tell myself
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone

[Chorus]
Wide awake, but it just feels wrong
Stay in bed 'til the whole year's gone
Wake me up when it's over
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone
Medicatе 'til my brain goes numb
Like a dream whеre your feet won't run (Won't run)
Stuck in place, paralyzed, I
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone (Gone)

[Post-Chorus]
(Sleepwalking when you're gone)

Took a flight to the west coast
I fell asleep at the window
Suddenly I feel my body
Fallin' fast into visions of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Movin' on to someone else
I'm a picture left on your shelf
And the dream's a lie, I tell myself
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone

[Chorus]
Wide awake, but it just feels wrong
Stay in bed 'til the whole year's gone
Wake me up when it's over
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone
Medicate 'til my brain goes numb
Like a dream where your feet won't run (Won't run)
Stuck in place, paralyzed, I
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone (Gone)

[Post-Chorus]
(Sleepwalking when you're gone)

[Bridge]
What a shame, what a shame, what a shame
It's all fun and games 'til you don't wanna play now
Run away, run away, run away
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone (Gone)
[Chorus]
Wide awake, but it just feels wrong
Stay in bed 'til the whole year's gone
Wake me up when it's over
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone
Medicate 'til my brain goes numb (Goes numb)
Like a dream where your feet won't run  (Won't run)
Stuck in place, paralyzed, I
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone

[Outro]
Feel like I'm sleepwalking when you're gone (Gone)1Embed Sleepwalking Sleepwalking All Time Low punk
