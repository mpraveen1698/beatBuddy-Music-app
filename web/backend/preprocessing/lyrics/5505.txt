24 ContributorsGo the Distance Lyrics[Verse 1]
I have often dreamed
Of a far-off place
Where a great, warm welcome
Will be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer
When they see my face
And a voice keeps saying
This is where I'm meant to be

[Chorus]
I will find my way
I can go the distance
I'll be there someday
If I can be strong
I know every mile
Will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere to feel like I
Belong

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
I am on my way
I can go the distance
I don't care how far
Somehow I'll be strong
I know every mile
Will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere to find where I belongYou might also like4Embed Go the Distance Hercules (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Roger Bart;Disney disney
