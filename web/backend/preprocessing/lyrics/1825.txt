24 ContributorsState Lines Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here, I'll forgive my thoughts now
Steer it 'cause I forget the dots now

[Chorus]
Was it all any more faded after all?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Are you sure? Did you call? Did we ever really talk?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't

[Verse 2]
Dear, I wouldn't bet your heart down
Clear but I couldn't get my head around

[Chorus]
Was it all any more faded after all?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Are you sure? Did you call? Did we ever really talk?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

[Outro]
I've been awake in every state line
Dyin' to make it last us a lifetime
Tryin' to shake that it's all on an incline
Find me a way, I'll be yours in a landslideSee Novo Amor LiveGet tickets as low as $43You might also like13Embed State Lines Birthplace Novo Amor indie-pop
