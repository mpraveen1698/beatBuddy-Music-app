29 ContributorsComing for You Lyrics[Intro: Nick Furlong]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die (Good job, Sho)
My father told me

[Chorus: SwitchOTR]
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you

[Verse 1: SwitchOTR]
See, I ain't really into the verbal
My broski strapped, no Dijk, no Virgil
The van might buss that circle
See, I'm tryna blow off this music ting
And pray that I end up commercial
And 'bout time that I make some records
Show them why that I go universal
('Cause I can't) 'Cause I can't get stuck in the ends
I need me a yard with a big ass fence
Lambo truck or Mercedes-Benz
No fake love, no need to pretend
If I cut you off, it's straight intent
Guys out here tryna drill and repent
Same bad B that I need in defence
The J1's coulda been A1, but I can't follow the latest trends
Broski might handle the can and let off shots, 'cause the bullets bisexual
It's really for them boy there, can definitely hit that bitch right next to you
Every time I rap on the beat, gotta show them why man feels presentable
And chicks love pick and choose their guys like a video game collectible

Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you

[Verse 2: J1mulla & A1orFundz]
Bare man change, people fake (Mm-mm)
The world so fucked nowadays, I don't trust no one
'Cause they lied to my face (they lied)
I can't stop working, we all die one day
Back then, I was lonely (Lonely)
I ain't got time for these phonies (Phonies)
Got my bro like Zack got Cody
I'm a top boy like Modie (Ah-ah)
Anti-social, I don't like to socialize
They cap on the net, that's social lies
When brodie died, I cried, that's real life
I feel a way, I just don't feel right
Could've been homeless
My heart so cold, it's frozen
DTB, I find it hard to open
I've been busy livin' life in the moment
Reason why I ain't got time to lotion
[Chorus: SwitchOTR]
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you

[Outro: SwitchOTR]
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
