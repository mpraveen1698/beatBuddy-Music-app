18 ContributorsHeadlights Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, I'm gonna use every heartbeat
Oh, oh, today not tomorrow
Oh, oh, I'm diving in so deep
Oh, oh, far from the shallows

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Blinded by, blinded by headlights
Running in, running in the headlights
Light me up, light me up, headlights
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Blinded by, blinded by headlights
Running in, running in the headlights
Light me up, light me up, headlights

[Drop]
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Hela, hela, headlights
Hela, hеla, headlights

Blinded by, blinded by headlights

Blinded by, blinded by headlights
Running in, running in the headlights
Light me up, light me up, headlights
