34 ContributorsLove Is a Drug Lyrics[Verse]
Uh
I don't understand it
Giving my emotions and they take it all for granted
I can never trust another single woman on this planet
I give you the world
And guaranteed, you would still take advantage of the boy, nigga damn it
I mean, look at all the damage that you leavin'
You can never find better, girl I mean it
The combination while your hair tied, pull your hair back
You ain't Christian, but I had you screamin' "Jesus"
I swear you'll never find a better nigga
But I'ma find a girl that make it thicker
And you too busy taking selfies with niggas
You probably couldn't see the bigger picture
I regret
Every single text that I sent
And every single little word that I said and time spent
You was just a hoe, was too dumb to notice
They say that love's a drug
I guess I overdosed, damn

[Outro]
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Feeling it all
Swear I never thought that I would feel it at all, yeah
Somethin'
Somethin' new, somethin' new, yeahYou might also like10Embed Love Is a Drug Thbk. Papithbk sad
