Cold when it's critical
Cool but cynical
Maxed out never minimal
That's how we function
Cold when it's critical
Cool but cynical
Maxed out never minimal
That's how we function
Cold when it's critical
Cool but cynical
Maxed out never minimal
That's how we function
Cold when it's critical
Cool but cynical
Maxed out never minimal
That's how we function
Cold when it's critical
Cool but cynical
Maxed out never minimal
That's how we function
Cold when it's critical
Cool but cynical
Maxed out never minimal
That's how we function
Cold when it's critical

Welcome to London (Yeah)
That's how we function, that's how we function
Nobody trust nobody
Welcome to London (Yeah)
That's how we function, that's how we function
Nobody trust nobody 'round here

[Verse 1]
So when I step to the high road
I see CCTV and cameras
They goin' hard for the riches and fortunes
From the street vendors to the bankers
Boys in blue always lookin' for a problem
There’s a price to pay when you’re a Black man
There’s a next one pressurin' both sides
He don’t give a fuck, and we call him the taxman (Yo)
So welcome to London fam
Poverty we got it in abundance fam
Some are homeless, some are reckless
You'll get fucked if you buck up on a London gang
Watch sterling a run up in your London grands
Put work in and mash up all ya London plans
Ya can't argue when they start charge you
Congestion that's another London scam
[Pre-Chorus]
Cold when it's critical
Cool but cynical
Maxed out never minimal
That's how we function
Cold when it's critical
Cool but cynical
Maxed out never minimal
That's how we function

[Chorus]
Welcome to London (Yeah)
That's how we function, that's how we function
Nobody trust nobody
Welcome to London (Yeah)
That's how we function, that's how we function
Nobody trust nobody 'round here

[Verse 2]
Flexin', but slowly we’re sufferin'
On his name round ya see man covetin'
We go hard but we know we been a likkle
But the ego don’t show where we strugglin'
Cold even through we got the teapot bubblin'
Youngas on the roadside they do the hustlin'
So the street crimes always epidemic and ya could
Find a real killer in the club shufflin' (Yo)
So welcome to London fam
Black cabs, red busses and the white van man
They got oysters, they not just seafood
So the boy dem can follow and see you
24 hours every day my city don’t sleep
You need P’s in my city 'cause its not cheap
Top quality has never been a guarantee
We'll extort you, your friends and family
[Pre-Chorus]

[Bridge]
What the fuck d'you mean next week?

So fuck off, find my money, come back
Put it in me hand and then fuck off
Welcome to London ya mug

That's how we function
Welcome to London ya mug
