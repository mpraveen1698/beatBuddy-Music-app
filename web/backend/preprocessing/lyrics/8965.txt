10 ContributorsPieces Lyrics[Verse 1]
You and me
Got ourselves a problem
I can see
This better than I solve 'em
I believed
I found a way around it
I will leave
This better than I found it

[Chorus]
There’s too much smoke to see it
There’s too much broke to feel this
Well, I love you, I love you
And all of your pieces
There’s too much smoke to see it
There’s too much broke to feel this
Well, I love you, I love you
And all of your pieces

[Verse 2]
History’s a letter made of scarlet
Victories look better when you’ve called it
Misery’s the moment when I lost you
It’s pleasure in a costume
It’s more than what it cost you

There’s too much smoke to see it
There’s too much broke to feel this
Well, I love you, I love you
And all of your pieces
There’s too much smoke to see it
There’s too much broke to feel this
Well, I love you, I love you
And all of your pieces

[Bridge]
All of your pieces
All of your pieces
All of your pieces
All of your pieces
All of your pieces
All of your pieces

[Chorus]
There’s too much smoke to see it
There’s too much broke to feel this
Well, I love you, I love you
And all of your pieces
There’s too much smoke to see it
There’s too much broke to feel this
Well, I love you, I love you
And all of your pieces3Embed Pieces Black Bear Andrew Belle folk
