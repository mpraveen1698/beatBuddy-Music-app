All we ever wanted was everything
All we ever got was cold
Get up, eat jelly
Sandwich bars, and barbed wire
Squash every week into a day

[Interlude]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
The sound of the drum is calling
The sound of the drum has called
Flash of youth shoot out of darkness
Factorytown

[Interlude]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Oh, to be the cream
Oh, to be the cream
Oh, to be the cream
Oh, to be the creamYou might also like12Embed All We Ever Wanted Was Everything The Sky's Gone Out Bauhaus goth
