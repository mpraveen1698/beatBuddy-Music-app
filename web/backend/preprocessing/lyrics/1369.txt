Oh, I'm such a loser, how'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now, I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine 'cause I

[Verse 1]
I just might get a little too drunk, so I won't think about us (Uh)
I don't think about what (Uh) we could have been
And I stay up like three or four nights, so I won't dream about us (Uh)
I wake up with no luck (No), I just can't win

[Pre-Chorus]
I should've seen it all along (Ah-ah)
She was one in a million (Ah-ah)
It hurts whenever someone says her name
(Someone says her name)
When wе were goin' off and on (Ah-ah)
I guess I rеally played it wrong (Ah-ah)
I should have never let her slip away

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm such a loser, how'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now, I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine 'cause I

Uh, I just might been a little too gone
When she needed somebody (Uh)
Up against her body (Woah) at 2 AM
Yeah, and now I keep lying to myself
When she's just joking probably (She's joking probably)
She'll probably call me and we'll be us again

[Pre-Chorus]
I should've seen it all along (Ah-ah)
She was one in a million (Ah-ah)
Now she's in love, and I'm in second place (Damn)

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm such a loser, how'd I ever lose her? (Lose her)
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind (Now, I)
Now, I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her? (Her)
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine (Fine) 'cause I, uh

Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser (I say)
Oh my, my, my, my

[Bridge]
Tell me God is real
Do you think about me still
Or am I livin' for nothin'?
Don't know where it went
Wrong but I'll just take the hint
It's gonna take some adjusting

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm such a loser, how'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind

'Cause I'm a loser
