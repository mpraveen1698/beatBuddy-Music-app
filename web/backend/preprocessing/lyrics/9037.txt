12 ContributorsNeon Grave Lyrics[Intro]
(I want to feel it come down)

[Verse 1]
Fading fire, I see the sky begin to fall apart
I know you're tired, but you can't keep running
(Can't keep running)
Terrified I won't see you on the other side
The cancer couldn't stop, now you're buried in a box
But you can't keep running
(Can't keep running)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know the way it feels
You cheated death, but now it's real
When your eyes roll back
And the world turns black

[Chorus]
Can Heaven fall into my lonely Earth?
'Cause Hell is where I know you won't return
Can Heaven fall to Earth?
I want to feel it come down

[Verse 2]
Neon grave, illuminate the life you took away
Your heart expirеd, and now the hurt keeps coming
(The hurt keeps coming)
Silver linеs, I don't think that I will ever find
How to make it right when you fade into the night
Yeah, the hurt keeps coming
(The hurt keeps coming)

I wanna know the way it feels
You cheated death, but now it's real
When your eyes roll back
And the world turns black

[Chorus]
Can Heaven fall into my lonely Earth?
'Cause Hell is where I know you won't return
Can Heaven fall to Earth?
I want to feel it come down

[Breakdown]
(White noise filling my sleep
Bury me alive 'til I'm six feet deep)
White noise filling my sleep
Bury me alive 'til I'm six feet deep
Six feet deep

[Bridge]
I wanna know, how does it feel
When your eyes roll back?
And I wanna know
Will we meet again?
When the world turns black
[Chorus]
Can Heaven fall into my lonely Earth?
'Cause Hell is where I know you won't return
Can Heaven fall to Earth?
I want to feel it

[Outro]
