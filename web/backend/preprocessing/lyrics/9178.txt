1 ContributorI Wonder LyricsWake up in the morning
Come rise with our flame
No requests, no blues
Why are we maimed
Easy my darling
What shall we do
Rockin' and skankin'
No requests, no dues

A church washed up and we played on greens
A wall puts up in the garden above
Soldiers and black gowns walking their rounds
Tombstones where flowers should be
How can you recall

See a church was built and we played on green
A wall puts up in the garden above
Soldiers and black gowns walking their rounds
Tombstones where flowers should be
How can you recallYou might also likeEmbed I Wonder Shalina Music Protassov trip-hop
