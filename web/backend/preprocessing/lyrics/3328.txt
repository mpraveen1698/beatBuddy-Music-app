Hello, it's so good to see you
We met before, but nice to meet you
Yeah, I don't really wanna be here like, ah-ah-ah-ah
What's my name? Do you remember?
I'm pretty sure you have my number
So let's pretend we like each other like, ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
This room is so suffocatin'
Walkin' on ice, but nobody breaks it
Stuck in this one-way conversation
Guess I'll be here for a while (Ah)
And you're blowin' smoke in my face (Ew)
And tellin' me all about your paycheck
Take a shot with a fake smile to chase it
Guess I'll take another round

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody in this party's fuckin' fake
I really wish that I could say it to your face
But I won't, so

[Chorus]
Hello, it's so good to see you
We met before, but nice to meet you
Yeah, I don't really wanna be here like, ah-ah-ah-ah
What's my name? Do you remember?
I'm pretty sure you have my number
So let's pretend we like each other like, ah-ah-ah-ah

Blah, blah, blah, I'm so bored
Love your shoes, tell me more
On and on about yourself
Can't you bother somebody else?
Raise a glass if you're like me, yeah
Gettin' trashed, 'cause you can't leave, yeah
Guess we're in this together
Makes my head hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody in this party's fuckin' fake
And so am I, but I just got here, so I gotta show some face

[Chorus]
Hello, it's so good to see you
We met before, but nice to meet you
Yeah, I don't really wanna be here like, ah-ah-ah-ah
What's my name? Do you remember?
I'm pretty sure you have my number
So let's pretend we like each other like, ah-ah-ah-ah

You're tryin' too hard
