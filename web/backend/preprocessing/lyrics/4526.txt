What did he mean
What are you?
Just a humble bounty hunter, ma'am
I guess you wonder where I've been
(Where I've been)
(What are you?)
I searched to find a love within

I guess you wonder where I've been
(Where I've been)
I searched to find a love within

I guess you wonder where I've been
(Where I've been)
(What are you?)
I searched to find a love within

(Humble bounty hunter mam)

I guess you wonder where I've been
(Where I've been)
I searched to find a love within
