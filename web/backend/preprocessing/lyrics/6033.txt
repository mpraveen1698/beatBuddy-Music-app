Come a little bit closer hear what I have to say
Just like children sleeping we can dream this night away
But there's a full moon rising let's go dancing in the night
We go where the music's playing let's go out and feel the night

[Chorus]
Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon

[Verse 2]
When we were strangers I watched you from afar
When we were lovers I loved you with all my heart
But now it's getting late and the moon is climbing high
I want to celebrate see it shining in the night

[Chorus]
Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon

Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon

Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moonYou might also like2Embed Harvest Moon Pacific Standard Time Poolside disco
