119 ContributorsBroken Lyrics[Chorus]
Will you end my pain? Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out? Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart, while I'm going
Will you end my pain? Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out? Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart, while I'm going insane

[Dialogue]
Most people are searching for happiness. They're looking for it. They're trying to find it in someone or something outside of themselves. That's a fundamental mistake. Happiness is something that you are and it comes from the way you think

[Verse 1]
Can you break my bones? Will you tear my skin?
Can you taste my lust? Can you feel my sin?
See, I'm a waste of life, I should just kill myself
Yeah, I could slit my wrists, but it really wouldn't help
Wouldn't fix my issues or change your mind
'Cause I broke your heart and you buried mine
Now I'm  six-feet deep and I can't breathe
I got dirt in my eyes and blood on my sleeves
But I dig my way up through these roots and leaves
So, I can get some air, so, I can finally breathe
And now I'm on my knees, oh, baby, begging please
Will you? Will you?

Will you end my pain? Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out? Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart, while I'm going
Will you end my pain? Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out? Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart, while I'm going insane

[Dialogue]
We cannot choose the things that will happen to us, but we can choose the attitude we will take towards anything that happens

[Outro]
Goodbye
Don't you miss me when I'm gone
Goodbye
'Cause you're the fucking reason that I'm not around
Goodbye
Don't you miss me when I'm, miss me when I'm gone
Goodbye
'Cause you're the fucking reason that I'm not around
Fucking reason that I'm not around
Bitch, you're the fucking reason that I'm not around111Embed Broken Broken Lund chill
