Hope when you take that jump, you don't fear the fall
Hope when the water rises, you built a wall
Hope when the crowd screams out, it's screaming your name
Hope if everybody runs, you choose to stay
Hope that you fall in love and it hurts so bad, hey
The only way you can know, you give it all you have
And I hope that you don't suffer, but take the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Hope when the moment comes, you'll say

[Chorus]
I, I did it all
I, I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places, the things that I did
Yeah, with every broken bone
I swear I lived

[Verse 2]
Hope that you spend your days, but they all add up
And when that sun goes down hope you raise your cup, oh-oh
I wish that I could witness all your joy and all your pain

[Pre-Chorus]
But until my moment comes, I'll say
