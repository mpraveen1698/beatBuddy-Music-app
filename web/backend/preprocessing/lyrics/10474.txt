Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us
I want us, said I want us
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us
I want us, said I want us

[Verse 1]
Said I gotta get money, swear I still love you
I don't wanna go, but you know that I have to
Touch road, gotta play shows
Crowd go wild for the shit I wrote
But this shit so-so, lose control
Gotta change up everything I know
Better, run ways when you smell that smoke
Better, hold me when my head gon' blow like

[Pre-Chorus]
Hasta la vista, dyin' to see ya
In a dream that I had where I sing in arenas
Hasta la vista, dyin' to see ya, baby
It ain't so bad when there's nothin' between us
You might also like[Chorus]
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us
I want us, said I want us
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us
I want us, said I want us

[Verse 2]
Gone so fast, all the bad habits
Not gon' last, better run back, kid
Just so sad, worse than last year
Just might crash, just might crash
Just might
Everybody left except for you and I
She don't want stories and lullabies
She don't understand that it's do or die
Said I can buy it all, but it's all a lie

[Bridge]
No trade for the things I lost
No train for the boy that stopped
Run ways into these arms of mine
No trade for the things I lost
No train for the boy that stopped
Run ways into these arms of mine
[Chorus]
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us (Yeah-eah, yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh)
I want us, said I want us
Said she want more, I'm not enough
(Like hasta la vista)
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up (Yeah-yeah-yeah, -eah)
(Dyin' to see ya)
Baby, come home, I want us
(In a dream that I had)
I want us, said I want us
(Where I sing in arenas)
Said she want more, I'm not enough
(Like hasta la vista)
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up (Yeah-yeah-yeah, -eah)
(Dyin' to see ya)
Baby, come home, I want us
(In a dream that I had)
I want us, said I want us7Embed more always keshi chill
