Yeah
Oh my God, Ronny

[Chorus]
It's a vibe, yeah, feeling right, yeah
Keep it quiet, thought a nigga told you, you
So much ice, yeah, fantasize, yeah
The city lights, got a nigga so, yeah, day and night
Through the day and night, through the day and night
Got a nigga so, yeah, day an' night
Through the day and night, through the day and night
Through the day and night, through the day and night

[Verse]
Don't crash, don't crash, you're movin' too fast now
More cash, more cash, might throw it on her ass now
Butterfly on the whip, that's a nigga doors
All my hoes super thick and don't keep no legs closed
I got stripes like Adidas do, uh
My whip the color of Beetlejuice, uh
Peter Pan, Gucci fan, look at you, uh
Nigga, you hatin', you bitchin', you, ayy
Niggas be whinin' like bitches and uh
Nigga quite frankly don't get that shit, ayy
These niggas bored, they irrelevant, ayy
Niggas be watchin', these niggas be—

Got a nigga so, yeah, day and night
Through the day and night, through the day and night
