22 ContributorsYou’re All I Want Lyrics[Verse 1]
You would use your songs to say
The words you couldn't say
And every word you sang
Was about you and me
I loved everything you've wrote
And when you would sing
I felt that my heart was falling

[Chorus]
You're all I want
We fucked so hot it left me faded
For all you are
There is no other love, it's only yours
You're all I want, all the love

[Verse 2]
And with Cristal and pink champagne
On our wedding day
You had a Hollywood sign made of cocaine for us
Then you got on top of it
And you sang to me
As the snow was falling

[Chorus]
You're all I want
We fucked so hot it left me faded
For all you are
There is no other love, it's only yours
You're all I want, all the loveSee Cigarettes After Sex LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like4Embed You're All I Want You're All I Want Cigarettes After Sex ambient
