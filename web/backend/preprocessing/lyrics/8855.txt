A “Blackbird” flies
from a battered sax
at the tonal center
of the circle,
its darkness tipping
the fountain’s waves,
rippling flag-like
under this April sky
with a rhythm
both black and white,
tho perchance
only we can C
what is sigil in its rites.
Ignore the bystanders
assuming the white fountain
can’t be metaphor,
or the soaring “Blackbird”
somehow symbol.
It's true
any blue-black wail
over widening water
(even raving evermore)
might seem bound by
simple chords
if what spouted
from the dreadlocked musician
was simply what hе’d heard—
but weren’t thеse chords
also voiced by Bird,
whose tarnished horn
wasn't spurred
by splashing water
or rippling wind,
but perhaps a C
sharply diminished
within?
If simply a cerulean sound
of the fountain
stirred or stilled
the green bills in his case,
or solely a white silence
of clouds extended above,
no matter how high,
wouldn’t it still be
the yang of water
only brighter?
How then does he seem
to reed of a thing
more jet than the yen
of a blackbird’s
undulating wings on the wind?
Is what his woodwind
tries to sculpt
more art
or artifact?
Could any sculpture
ringed with purring pigeons
B more than just
a spouting place where he
(god with a minor G)
came to create?
What chords are these?
Which Key?
An I nearly illusive
as the eye
of Stevens’ blackbird
looks to unravel its complex roots,
(but finds merely
real chords it can knot).
And as he blows
this epistle of Paul’s
—and augments or diminishes
any tint of that sky—
what becomes artifact
in our bicameral minds?
Given how A minor seventh
“singing” of starry darkness
makes rings of paradox
in admiral circles,
could “these broken wings”
provide any lift?
Meaning listen,
who can say
what the “sunken eyes”
of our enslaved ancestors
dreamt of darkly
thinking overboard
of some minor sea?
Oh play black Bird,
riff on if
Si'l vous plait,
these riddle passages
are composed
of changes you chose
and by choosing
tried to unchain.
Contrafact what
—as the conductor
of dusk dons
his onyx tuxedo—
could swing
in the traffic's rhythm
and why we—
despite knowing
a dominant chord
can’t be conflated
with a universal key—
might sense
in a siren circling
above the basin
—above even
the arc & spume
of its spray—
a higher harmony,
not quite
a Call to Prayer—
but perhaps a small glare
in the i of “Arise” . . .Embed Starry Sky Starry Sky April Baxter piano
