14 ContributorsSo Good Lyrics[Verse 1: Marco Luka]
I see you workin' your magic
Oh won't you put on a show
You turned my love into madness
I know I said I would go

[Pre-Chorus: Tanu]
I wanted to know, what led you to find me
I'm under your hold, I need you to guide me
How you so cold, when the sun is so blinding?
I wanted to know

[Chorus: Manas]
Did you really mean it?
When you said you loved me
You got me so good
I can’t escape the feeling
When you said you love me
You got me so good
So good (so good yeah)
So good (so good yeah)
So good (so good yeah)
So good (so good)
So did you really mean it?
When you said you love me
You got me so good

Down baby, down baby
You ran me right right through the ground baby, ground baby
I never wanted you around baby, 'round baby
And now you're nowhere to bе found

[Pre-Chorus: Tanu]
I wanted to know
What led you to find me
I'm undеr your hold, I need you to guide me
How you so cold, when the sun is so blinding?
I wanted to know

[Chorus: Manas]
Did you really mean it?
When you said you loved me
You got me so good
I can’t escape the feeling
When you said you love me
You got me so good
So good (so good yeah)
So good (so good yeah)
So good (so good yeah)
So good (so good yeah)
So did you really mean it?
When you said you love me
You got me so good5Embed So Good So Good Weston Estate chill
