20 ContributorsSO WHAT Lyrics[Intro: Dro Kenji]
Uh, uh

[Chorus: Dro Kenji & DC The Don]
Okay, I'm up, I'm wide awake
I see the phony and the fake
Niggas mad 'cause I get paper
Cool me down
She fuck rappers, I ain't had to fly her to me
Don't run down on Lil' Kenji, I keep big ass blickys with me (Go)
Run down on the gang right now, all my niggas on go (Go)
Red dot with a .556, niggas kickin' down doors
I got big bag rolled up, smokin' gas, poured up (Yeah)
He get blast, blown up (Yeah, hey, hey)
He get blast, so what? (Go)

[Verse 1: DC The Don]
How the fuck get a new i8 with the butterfly doors? (Go, go)
Donny fresh out of LAX with some L.A. hoes (Go, go)
I put that shit on, lil' bitch, I just hopped in the Phantom (Go, yeah)
I ride with the motherfuckin' goats (Go)
When I'm rockin' that green, I feel slimy as fuck (Shit)
Danny Phantom the whip, and Dior on my coat (Yeah)
I just step on the gas and I float (Yeah)
My bitch, she bad, but she doin' the most (Yeah)
Oh, you think you a demon? This nigga a joke (Yeah)
Aimin' straight for you, Taliban, shoot through the floor (Go)
Watch me make that bitch jump, jump, jump
When I hop on the stage, they gon' jump through the floor (Jump, shit)
Yeah, they stay on my dick, I just go with the flow (Jump)
We can turn the bitch up (Jump)
We keep goin' some more (Jump, jump, jump)
Bitch, I got on Rick right now, what the fuck did you think? (Jump, bitch)
Three-five in the 'wood right now, niggas smokin' on dank (Go)
That's why I say I'm The Don of a Don 'cause I'm doin' this shit, I do something he can't (Go, go, go, ayy)
I just bang on my chest like the Planet of the Apes
We could slide through your hood in a big-ass tank (Go, go, go, go)

[Verse 2: Dro Kenji]
Like, I get so damn high, I think I seen an AC-130
I fucked that bitch one time and blocked her 'cause I can't love on birdies
I'm in my private section, peace out and her friends all came with me
This lil' Taurus pistol on me, ain't for violence, it's for peace when I'm outside
I just seen a opp nigga tryna switch sides
I can't fuck you for the free, the bitch out of her mind
Money what I need, let's say it one more time (Let's go, okay)
Big bag, stripper ass, I had a dream like Martin Luther
A hundred fuckin' money bags, I'll add that shit up, fuck a tutor
Money what I need, let's say it one more time
Money what I need, let's say it one more time (Let's go)
