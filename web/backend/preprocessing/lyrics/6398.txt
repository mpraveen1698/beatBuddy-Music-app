1 ContributorTokyo Lyrics[Intro]
I was high in New York
I went clubbing in Berlin
I got friends in LA
And I had dumplings in Beijing
Robbed the biggest bank in Rio
But in Moscow I was broke
Just one thing nobody knows
I got dumped in Tokyo
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I got dumped in Tokyo
Robbed the biggest bank in Rio
But in Moscow I was broke
Just one thing nobody knows
I got dumped in Tokyo

[Hook]
I was high in New York
I went clubbing in Berlin
I got friends in LA
And I had dumplings in Beijing
Robbed the biggest bank in Rio
But in Moscow I was broke
Just one thing nobody knows
I got dumped in Tokyo
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I got dumped in Tokyo
Robbed the biggest bank in Rio
But in Moscow I was broke
Just one thing nobody knows
I got dumped in Tokyo
