Georgia, wrap me up in all your
I want ya in my arms
Oh, let me hold ya
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I used to say

[Chorus: Stephen Sanchez & Georgia Brown]
I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said I would never fall, unless it's you I fall into
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you

[Verse 2: Stephen Sanchez & Georgia Brown]
Georgia pulled me in
I asked to love her once again
You fell, I caught ya
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I used to say

[Chorus: Stephen Sanchez & Georgia Brown]
I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said I would never fall unless it's you I fall into
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
