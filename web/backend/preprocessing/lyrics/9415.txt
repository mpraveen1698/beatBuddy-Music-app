Do you believe in Heaven above?
Do you believe in love?
Don't tell a lie, don't be false or untrue
It all comes back to you

[Verse 2]
Open fire!
On my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defenses are down
A kiss or a frown
I can't survive on my own

[Verse 3]
If a girl walks in and carves her name in my heart
I'll turn and run away
Every day, we've all been led astray
It's hard to be lucky in love

[Pre-Chorus]
It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
You're looking for love
Calling Heaven above
You might also like[Chorus]
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now

[Verse 4]
Empty dreams can only disappoint
In a room behind your smile
But don't give up
Don't give up
Give up, give up, give up
You can be lucky in love

[Pre-Chorus]
It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
You're looking for love
Calling Heaven above
[Chorus]
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now

[Chorus]
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now

[Outro]
