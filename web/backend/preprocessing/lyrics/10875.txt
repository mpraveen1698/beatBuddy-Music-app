Drawn to your halo (Halo)

In the eye of the storm
You're the hand that's reaching out
Hold me still, as we go
There is hope on the horizon

Father of hearts
Son of the night
Drawn to your halo
Father of hearts
Guider of light
Taking me by storm

Oooh, drawn to your halo
Oooh, drawn to your halo

Drawn to your halo (Halo)
