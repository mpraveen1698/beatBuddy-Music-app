(One, two)

[Verse 1]
The college years were lean, well
Coming out but maybe not so clean, my love
And if I stay much longer
My feelings for you, they might get much stronger, now
A Motorola coma
Sleep your way into a deep diploma, girl
At the dormitory
You've come to pour me one of your best stories, girl

[Chorus]
And I feel your face getting wet
Like the color red of roulette
And I place my losing bet
On your side

And I see your eyes of regret
But you gave as good as you get
Like a Massachusetts thrеat
Running wild

[Verse 2]
A pair of dirty jeans that
You would wash inside my brass machine, that's good
Laying on your mattrеss
A thing of beauty, we would need more practice now
Hall & Oates were singing
The funny notes that you were always bringing, girl
An elevator's closing
Hard to hide when love is so exposing

And I feel your face getting wet
Like the color red of roulette
And I place my losing bet
On your side

And I see your eyes of regret
But you gave as good as you get
Like a Massachusetts threat
Running wild

[Bridge]
When I drove her to Villanova
Light me up when you decide
The stark aroma of your Tacoma
A tiny box where we reside
A-battle tested, a life invested
Duly noted and denied
A-fully loaded, space encoded
A quiet night out in the sky

[Verse 3]
Your stack of lies was daunting
A tribute to your mind but way more haunting, now
A talking psycho killer
Betrayed the heads of even Henry Miller, now
Conspiracy's a theory
I wonder, Tim, if this could be your Leary, love, ah
She act like Marlon Brando
Born online inside the San Fernando
