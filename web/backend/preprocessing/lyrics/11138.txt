It's so hard to recognize
That these diamonds fail to glow
Take pills to ease my mind
As long as I don't feel alone

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Hranica]
In debt to become incomplete
Step back 'til we hear the song repeat
Watch as I become obsolete
Step back and

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
Welcome to the way down
Keep on telling, selling me a way out
Another offer of a faultless life now
But I think I'll just keep it inside
Stitch it up and wear it with pride

[Verse 2: Mike Hranica]
What's fake is always on my mind
Like money makes the rivers flow
Contact the sacred valley
Let it know, all its trees must go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Hranica]
In debt to become incomplete
Step back 'til we hear the song repeat
Watch as I become obsolete
Step back and

Welcome to the way down (Way down)
Keep on telling, selling me a way out (Way out)
Another offer of a faultless life now (Life now)
But I think I'll just keep it inside (Woah-oh-oh)
Stitch it up and wear it with pride

[Post-Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster]
(Welcome to the way down)

[Bridge: Mike Hranica]
They enforce that you don't matter
Man's horns dictate thereafter
But I'll fight, have a chance at this
Fight the chains, fight the engine's hiss

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Step back
Step back andâ€”

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyter, Mike Hranica, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
Welcome to the way down (Way down)
Keep on telling, selling me a way out (Way out)
Another offer of a faultless life now (Life now)
But I think I'll just keep it inside
Stitch it up and wear it with pride
[Outro: Mike Hranica]
