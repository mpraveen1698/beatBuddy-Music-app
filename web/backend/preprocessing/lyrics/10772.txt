8 ContributorsC’mon Everybody LyricsAh well, c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight
I got some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it right
Well, I've been doin' my homework all week long
And now the house is empty and the folks are gone
Hooo! C'mon, everybody!

Ah well, my baby's number one, but I'm gonna dance with three or four
And the house'll be a-shakin' from the bare feet a-slappin' on the floor
Well, when you hear that music you can't sit still
If your brother won't rock then your sister will
Hooo! C'mon, everybody!

Well, we'll really have a party, but we gotta put a guard outside
If my folks come a-home, I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide
There'll be no more movies for a week or two
No more runnin' round with the usual crew
Who cares? C'mon, everybody!

C'mon, everybody
C'mon, everybodyYou might also likeEmbed C’Mon Everybody 12 Of His Biggest Hits Eddie Cochran rockabilly
