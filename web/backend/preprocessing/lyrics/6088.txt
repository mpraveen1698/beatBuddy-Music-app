64 ContributorsI Don’t Care Lyrics[Intro]
(Oh)
(Oh)

[Verse 1]
Say my name and his in the same breath
I dare you to say they taste the same
Let the leaves fall off in the summer
And let December glow in flames (In flames; oh)
Erase myself and let go
Start it over again in Mexico
These friends, they don't love you
They just love the hotel suites now

[Chorus]
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I said I (I) don't (Don't) care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh)
(Oh)

Oh, take a chance, let your body get a tolerance
I'm not a chance, put a heatwave in your pants
Pull a breath like another cigarette
Pawn shop heart, trading up (Said no; oh)
I'm the oracle in my chest
Let the guitar scream like a fascist
Sweat it out, shut your mouth, free love on the streets, but
In the alley, it ain't that cheap now

[Chorus]
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I said I (I) don't (Don't) care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh)
(Oh)

[Bridge]
Mm, said I don't care just what you think
As long as it's about me
I said I don't care just what you think
As long as it's about me
I said I don't care (I don't care; no, I don't)
Said I don't care (I don't care)
Said I (I) don't (Don't) care (Care; oh)
I (I) don't (Don't) care (No, I don't; oh)
I don't care (I said I don't care)
I said I (I) don't (Don't) care (Care)
[Chorus]
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me (Oh)
The best of us can find happiness in misery (Best of us, best of us, oh)
I said I (I) don't (Don't) care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
