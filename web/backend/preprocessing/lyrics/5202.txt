5 ContributorsFeeling You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I couldn’t give you a warning
But I felt it all over me
I hope you come where I’m going
And babe my hands are free

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling so hard
Swimming through stars
And maybe that’s alright

[Chorus]
I’m feeling you
Every single way
I’m feeling you
Ain’t no other way

[Verse 2]
There was a time I remember
Breathing air like this
But that was when I was younger
Didn’t know what I had I’d miss

[Chorus]
I’m feeling you
Every single way
I’m feeling you
Ain’t no other way

I mean it
Believe it, ohh

[Outro]
I’m feeling you (you)
