2 ContributorsForever Young Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember when we were kids
They say we got one life, one life to live
And when we grow up we show love
And give all we can give
'Cause we got one life, one life to live

[Pre-Chorus]
And as the days and nights go by
I never forget, I'll promise I'll remember
That till the day we die
I know you and I gon' keep on singing

[Chorus]
As the sun goes up and the sun goes down
We gon' stay the same till our time runs out
'Cause we live to love and we love to live
Where our hearts belong, we're forever young

[Post-Chorus]
We're forever young

[Verse 2]
I remember when we were kids
That we saw magic in the little things
We used to look at the sky as the clouds rolling by
And imagine that we were kings
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And as the days and nights go by
I never forget, I'll promise I'll remember
That till the day we die
I know you and I gon' keep on singing
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
As the sun goes up and the sun goes down
We gon' stay the same till our time runs out
'Cause we live to love and we love to live
Where our hearts belong, we're forever young

[Post-Chorus]
We're forever young
We're forever young

[Outro]
As the sun goes up and the sun goes down
We gon' stay the same till our time runs out
'Cause we live to love and we love to live
Where our hearts belong, we're forever youngEmbed Forever Young Made For You John De Sohn;LIAMOO progressive-house
