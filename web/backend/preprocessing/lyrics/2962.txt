See the man who stands upon the hill
He dreams of all the battles won
But fate had left its scars upon his face
With all the damage they had done

[Pre-Chorus]
And so time with age
It turns the page
Let the flesh
Submit itself to gravity

[Chorus]
Let our bodies lay, mark our hearts with shame
Let our blood in vain, you find God in pain
Now, if your convictions were a passing faith
May your ashes feed the river in the morning rays
And as the vermin crawls
We lay in the foundations of decay

[Verse 2]
He was there, the day the towers fell
And so he wandered down the road
And we would all build towers of our own
Only to watch the roots corrode

But it's much too late
You're in the race
So we'll press
And press 'til you can't take it anymore

[Chorus]
Let our bodies lay, mark our hearts with shame
Let our blood in vain, you find God in pain
And if, by his own hand, his spirit flies
Take his body as a relic to be canonized, now
And so he gets to die a saint
But she will always be the whore

[Breakdown]
(You look stressed out!)
Against faith (Cage all the animals)
Against all life ('Cause the message must be pure)
Against change (You can wander through the ruins)
We are plagued (But the poison is the cure)

[Bridge]
You must fix your heart
And you must build an altar where it swells
When the storm it gains, and the sky it rains
Let it flood, let it flood, let it wash away
And as you stumble through your last crusade
Will you welcome your extinction in the morning rays?
And as the swarm it calls, we lay in the foundations
[Outro]
Yes, it comforts me much more
Yes, it comforts me much more
To lay in the foundations of decay
Get up, coward!73Embed The Foundations of Decay The Foundations of Decay My Chemical Romance punk
