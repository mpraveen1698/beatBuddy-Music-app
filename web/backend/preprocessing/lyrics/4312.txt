6 ContributorsTell ’Em Lyrics[Intro]
(Siobhan Bell)
(Bordeaux and Non Native)
I call my opps Soulja Boy
They get caught, they gon' tell 'em
They gon' fold with pressure
Free my dogs, convicted felons

[Chorus]
Look, empty the clip, reload and crank that
I bet I up it and aim where his face at (Bah)
I'm tryna slide like a tape deck
They in my DM like, "Swish, where the tape at?"
I'm on the other side with my lil' bitch in the Bush
And she live where the rakes at
I keep a glove, finger-fuckin' her sturdy
I told 'em I'm practicin' safe sex

[Verse]
I ain't got time for the corny shit
Couple of shots, let me call me this bitch
I'm off the Henny, but, no, I ain't trippin'
You buggin', can't go like Mori Blixk
I see that V, I'ma throw at the car
Don't care if it's your mom's or your shorty's shit
If it's a sitchy, I'ma do it
I never cry to a prosecutor
Whole lotta rappers just be rappin'
We know the facts, y'all not the shooters
I pop a Perky and I probably use it
She wanna suck me and fuck to my music
Tony the Ape, that's my brother, he bug out
And we in L.A. on Melrose with a gun out
Play if you want
I got some 'ooters that I never mention
'Cause they do not want clout (Brr)
I am what I am and I said what I said
It's a whole lotta bitch niggas that want me dead
I'm still outside, we gon' slide like a sled
You know I'm on time if I pull up with Dread
I bought a fifty popper, leave him slumped
But I was really shoppin' for a pump
Sound like I'm havin' meetings with the plug
I'm tryna turn Kush into Runtz

I call my opps Soulja Boy
They get caught, they gon' tell 'em
They gon' fold with pressure
Free my dogs, convicted felons
I call my opps Soulja Boy
They get caught, they gon' tell 'em
I know they gon' tell 'em
Zanotti, he be tellin'

[Chorus]
Look, empty the clip, reload and crank that
I bet I up it and aim where his face at (Bah)
I'm tryna slide like a tape deck
They in my DM like, "Swish, where the tape at?"
I'm on the other side with my lil' bitch in the Bush
And she live where the rakes at
I keep a glove, finger-fuckin' her sturdy
I told 'em I'm practicin' safe sex

[Refrain]
I call my opps Soulja Boy
They get caught, they gon' tell 'em
They gon' fold with pressure
Free my dogs, convicted felons
I call my opps Soulja Boy
They get caught, they gon' tell 'em
I know they gon' tell 'em
Zanotti, he be tellin'Embed Tell 'Em Tell 'Em Rah Swish r-n-b
