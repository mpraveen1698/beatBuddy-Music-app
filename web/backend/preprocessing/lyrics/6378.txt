My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
One minute, please, while I sit back and reflect
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

[Verse 1]
Sip from this glass of hours
We pass like faulty towers
My sweetness, it's not weakness
Black holes wink, but she devours

[Chorus]
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

[Verse 2]
Greek to me, I don't speak Latin
Island calling, must be Staten
Nat King Cole and Dick Van Patten
New York Dolls all dressed in satin

[Chorus]
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
Just one possession in the life that we get
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

Jumping Jiminy, the cat is in the chimney
Curtain call and I need some anonymity
Trip my balls, beat, lost on Wall Street
We all fall, that's my cross street

[Chorus]
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

[Verse 4]
This business of forgiveness
Free your mind and we bear witness
Bring me windshield wiper fluid
Clean my slate so I'm not clueless

[Chorus]
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

[Verse 5]
Charming mister deadpan laughter
Walking towards the things we're after
Dancing David Lee toastmaster
Take some chances, that's my rapper
[Chorus]
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
So many daydreams that I tend to forget
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

[Verse 6]
Jumping Jiminy, the cat is in the chimney
Curtain call and I need some anonymity
Smokey defect, time to reflect
My game and now we eject

[Chorus]
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
One minute, please, while I sit back and reflect
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
Don't know how happy that a person can get
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
