Now there was a time
When you loved me so
I couldn't do wrong
Now you need to know

And I'm in deep

And can't wait 'til you see

[Verse 2]
Remember the time
When I eat you up
Yeah, I was a lie
That you can't give up
If I was to cheat
Oh, now would you see right through me?
If I sang a sad, sad, sad, sad song
Would you give it to me?
Would you?
