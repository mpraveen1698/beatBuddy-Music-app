18 ContributorsChampagne Shots Lyrics[Intro]
Yo, Parker
Ayy

[Verse 1]
I'm that same old brudda with the steez (Ice, ice, ice)
In the Baped-out fit, got a shark on the hood of my top and a ape on my tee (Ice, ice, ice)
Been a min since I linked with the bro, said, "Link up soon, let's talk over tea"
These days it's all about flex and talk but, bro, I'm tryna make this P
I got a text from the bro in Cali' tellin' me, sit tight, he's gonna make me a beat (Two secs, two secs)
In a gaff with a stylish babe on a stylish date, tryna make me a treat
She tryna talk 'bout Rovers, it's over, I'm tryna bag this dream (On God)
Two secs, let me take this call, I gotta skeet real soon, tryna pattern this G
It's been OT nights, bit far from the den, tryna get big checks and the cash flow steep
A couple boys on the block
Man, the feds been lappin' on locals and socials, man, it's lookin' all hot
Tell the yutes just stay off the violence and make P's don't worry 'bout crops
I'm just keepin' it real, man, you know my deal, trust me, big word to my pops

[Chorus]
In the yard in the ends with the broski, man, you know me, I'm takin' champagne shots
Don't talk like you know my ting when you're 'round my ting, I'll send you to the shops
My bro just came uptown with the latest trends and a few odd cops
In a vintage whip just glidin', stay slidin' in a coupe drop-top
(Skrr, skrr, skrr) Ayy

Baby girl, I got tea no Tetley, wait
Tell me why you never come check me
You tell me that I'm way too spendy, wait, babes, I'm just too flexy
I got eyes on my chest, that's Fendi (Flex)
Step to a high-class rave with a glass in my hand and I'm still in a tech fleece (Flex)
My bro got a coupe, that's a Bentley (Mmm)
Money come nice, get plenty
Got a foreign little baddie in the crew with the face caked up, but you know that's Fenty (Mmm)
Took a snap in the E-class coupe now she tryna ask who's pickin' up in the Benzy (Skrr)
Come off that flex, man, I'm not tryna flirt, man, you know I'm just friendly
These times, man, I might rock the Loubs on my way to her crib so she know I step pricey
Her old man left like a weirdo, I'm a hero, man, he ain't nothin' like me
Can't force my flex at the function, do it nicely, be subtle, man, lightly (Light)
Got my game back in like '010 but, man, YG's, I'm in love with the '90s
Don't show me no stripes my bro, man, that's not like me, only step in the Nike's (These checks)
True say my bro got a check but I said "'Lowe it, man, let's spend that wisely"
Don't flex your checks on Snapchat or IG, don't do it on IG

[Outro]
'Low it bro
Yeah
Don't do it on IG1Embed Champagne Shots Local Mvp Sainte chill
