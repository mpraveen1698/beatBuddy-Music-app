3 ContributorsHappier Than Ever Lyrics[Verse 1]
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuck—
I don't relate to you (No, I don't)
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty (I'd never)
You made me hate this city (No)

[Verse 2]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
All that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste thе time I don't have
Oh, don't try to make mе feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me aloneYou might also likeEmbed Happier Than Ever Happier Than Ever ASTN chill
