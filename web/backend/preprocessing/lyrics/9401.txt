How you doin'? How you been?
Life got heavy, didn't it?
Don't be shy, speak your mind
I'm not perfect, nor are you
But we both got things we been through
So I'll do all I can, I'll try to understand
'Cause I wanna love strangers like neighbours
I wanna be unafraid
So when the tears roll like waterfalls
You can call my name

[Chorus]
And when the weight of the world's on your shoulders
I will hold ya, I will hold you
And when the nights only seem to get colder
I will hold ya, I will hold ya

[Post-Chorus]
So let me hold you, ooh-ooh
Let me hold you, ooh-ooh
Let me hold you, ooh-ooh
Let me hold you, let me hold you

[Verse 2]
We look diffеrent, you and me
But our magic's undernеath
Different skin, same within
And we could do with healing
But love's my favorite feeling
So I'll give all of me if that is what you need
You might also like[Chorus]
And when the weight of the world's on your shoulders
I will hold ya, I will hold you
And when the nights only seem to get colder
I will hold ya, I will hold ya

[Post-Chorus]
So let me hold you, ooh-ooh
Let me hold you, ooh-ooh
Let me hold you, ooh-ooh
Let me hold you, let me hold you

[Bridge]
So take a little love until you have enough
To cover all the pain you hold
Don't you live in fear 'cause everybody here has
Blood that's running with gold
So take a little love until you have enough
To cover all the pain you hold
Don't you live in fear 'cause everybody here has
Blood that's running with gold

[Chorus]
And when the weight of the world's on your shoulders
I will hold ya, I will hold you
And when the nights only seem to get colder
I will hold ya, I will hold ya2Embed Let Me Hold You Second Nature Netsky;Hybrid Minds drum-and-bass
