All we need is
Passion
Let the world wash over me
Expression
Keep me up, can't go to sleep
Intention
Make a light that shine forever
Make a light that shines forever

[Verse]
We're pieces of a universe
We made a home
It's nothing without you
Just pieces of the universe
We're living in
And it's nothing without you

[Chorus]
All we need is
Passion
Let the world wash over me
Expression
Keep me up, can't go to sleep
Intention
Make a light that shine forever
Make a light that shines forever
You might also like[Bridge]
Just pieces of the universe
We're living in
And it's nothing without you

[Chorus]
All we need is
Passion
Let the world wash over me
Expression
Keep me up, can't go to sleep
Intention
Make a light that shine forever
Make a light that shines foreverEmbed Passion BOY RAC;Louis The Child indie-pop
