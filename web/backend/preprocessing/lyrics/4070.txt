41 ContributorsAnimals Lyrics[Intro (Reversed)]
Diamond, diamond in the mud
Infinity is waiting there
'Cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral

[Verse 1]
I do my best, but everything seems ominous
Not feeling blessed, quite the opposite
This shouldn't feel so monotonous
It never rains, but it pours

[Chorus]
We're just a bunch of fucking animals
But we're afraid of the outcome
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in
Says I should pull the pin

[Post-Chorus]
Should I just pull the pin?
Should I just pull the pin?

[Verse 2]
I dug my heels, I thought that I could stop the rot

Fucked it again, that was all I've got
It never rains, but it pours

[Bridge]
Buried under dirt, a diamond in the mud
Infinity is waiting there 'cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral

[Pre-Chorus]
Dream within a, dream within a

[Chorus]
We're just a bunch of fucking animals
But we're afraid of the outcome
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in

We're just a bunch of fucking animals
But we're afraid of the outcome
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in

Should I just pull the pin?
Should I just pull the pin?
(Buried under dirt, a diamond in the mud)
Should I just pull the pin?
(Infinity is waiting there 'cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral)
Should I just pull the pin?17Embed Animals For Those That Wish To Exist Architects metal
