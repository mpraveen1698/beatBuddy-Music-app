8 ContributorsIn Your Body Lyrics[Verse 1]
Say I'm crazy
Words can't make me feel what your body language shows me
I'll drop all I've got for a chance to feel you on me
Gain your love and I'll know you'll feel it coming
Wanna let these feelings have their place
In a world without your touch my love feels wasted
And to lay here on my own is not the same
It's not the same

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's times like these, to be lost in love
I fucked up, when you call my bluff
But it's times like these, to be centered in love
And I got love for you, so I say

[Chorus]
I say, baby
I feel it in your body, I feel it in your body
I say, honey
I feel it in your body, I feel it in your body

[Verse 2]
Take your guard off, what a joy to see you nakеd
Share your self with me your movеment feels so sacred
I'mma follow when you leading, give me something
And tomorrow, when you leave me know I won't be far
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Cause it's times like these, to be lost in love
I fucked up, but that's just my luck
But it's times like these, to be centered in love
And I got love for you, so I say

[Chorus]
I say, baby
I feel it in your body, I feel it in your body
I say, honey
I feel it in your body, I feel it in your body

[Outro]
My bad
It flew over my head
Fucking with my mindset
You still got me woo-ooo

My bad
It flew over my head
You bringing my heart death
You still got me woo-ooo

My bad
It flew over my head
Fucking with my mindset
You still got me woo-ooo
My bad
It flew over my head
You bringing my heart death
You still got me woo-oo
