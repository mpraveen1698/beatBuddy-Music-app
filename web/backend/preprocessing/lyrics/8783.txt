[Verse 1]
Caught up in specialness
I wish you could see that we are kings of bliss
Begging for misery
We get lost in comparison
Looking outside of me
I see this world is unraveling
I wonder, who could we be

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't want to see us lose any more time
This moment is a mountain to move
So move it inside
Wake up now, wake up now
Wake up now, wake up now

[Verse 2]
'Cause Marianne is a healer
She had pain on the mind
She said, "Your money is your medicine"
But she's sick all the time

'Cause you got lost in comparison
Always pretending you knew
When everything you were looking for
Was already looking at you

Oh, I don't want to see us lose any more time
This moment is a mountain to move
So move it inside
Wake up now, wake up now
Wake up now, wake up now

[Bridge]
Give it to me, realness
Give it to me, stillness
Give me some forgiveness
Give it to me, wholeness

[Chorus]
'Cause I was lost in comparison
Always pretending I knew
But everything I was looking for
Was already looking through
Wake up now, wake up now
Wake up now, wake up now
Wake up now, wake up now
Wake up now, wake up now1Embed Mountain To Move Wake Up Now Nick Mulvey british
