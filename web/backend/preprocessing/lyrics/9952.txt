You only fuck for love
Told me you could never get enough
Posing as a Playboy centerfold
You could be my Penthouse Pet, I know

[Chorus]
You make me think of
Storms on the beaches
With all the lights off
Everything is wrong but it's all right
Everything is wrong but it's all right
You're the only good thing in my life

[Verse 2]
Do what your heart desires
Love is always strange when it just starts
Shouldn't have a care left in the world
Naked, tanning by the swimming pool

[Chorus]
You make me think of
Storms on the beaches
With all the lights off
Everything is wrong but it's all right
Everything is wrong but it's all right
You're the only good thing in my life
