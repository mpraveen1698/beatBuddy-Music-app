I should've told you that I wanted you for me

[Verse 1]
You make it really hard to sleep
You keep me up
Baby you're my adrenaline, ah
Brought out this other side of me
You don't even know
Controlling my whole anatomy, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Fingers are holding you right at the edge
You're slipping out of my hands
Keeping my secrets all up in my head
I'm scared that you won't want me back

[Chorus]
I dance to every song like it's about you
I drink till I kiss someone who looks like you
I wish that I was honest when I had you
I should've told you that I wanted you for me
I dance to every song like it's about you
I drink till I kiss somеone who looks like you
I wish that I was honest whеn I had you
I should've told you that I wanted you for me

Yeah-yeah
Wanted you for me
I should've told you that I wanted you for me

[Verse 2]
I'm at this party just because
Tears in my cup
Swallow it down to feel the rush, ah
I'm on the other side of town
Spinning around
Don't even know you've let me down, ah, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Fingers are holding you right at the edge
You're slipping out of my hands
Keeping my secrets all up in my head
I'm scared that you don't want me back (Back, yeah)

[Chorus]
I dance to every song like it's about you
I drink till I kiss someone who looks like you
I wish that I was honest when I had you
I should've told you that I wanted you for me

[Bridge]
Innocent lovers
We hold on to one another
Let's rediscover
You are the one for me
[Chorus]
I dance to every song like it's about you
I drink till I kiss someone who looks like you
I wish that I was honest when I had you
I should've told you that I wanted you for me

[Outro]
Yeah
I dance, now, around you (Now, ah ah)
I kiss, drinks, looks like you (Looks like you)
One kiss, wish I had you (Honest when I had you)
