Cut my throat and throw me to the wolves
I'm just too tired, too tired to reload
Don’t need your tears, I don't need your love
Don't need your sympathy, I am above
I’ll be the ghost that haunts you in your sleep
You have anchored the hate in me
Don't need your tears, I don't need your love
Don't need your sympathy, I am above

[Chorus]
My God, I don't need you
I won't wait for you to come around
My God, as the pain inflates
I know I bleed, I bleed for you

[Post-Chorus]
We will never be, you aren't close to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for

[Verse 2]
Maybe it, just maybe it takes time to sink in
Did you not hear me loud and clear?
Don't need your tears, I don’t need your love
Don’t need your sympathy, I am above
