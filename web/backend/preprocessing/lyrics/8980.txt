Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ahh, ah-ahh-ahh-ah (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
To fall in love isn't easy when you're afraid of heights
But, I can't help but fall when I look into your eyes
So blue, I love the hue
But, more than that, I do love you and-
Every night I'm in bed, I fight to keep you from my mind and
Almost every day, that's how I spend most of my time
It's true, there is no use
I can't escape the thought of you
So

[Chorus]
Would you trust me to catch you at the bottom of the pool
If I told you, my whole heart, that I loved you
That I loved you, that I loved you?
But I'm afraid, I'm scared, of those romantic words, you see?
Ain't it ironic how those are just the songs I sing about?
My lovely, do you rеally love me?
When I hеar you whisper under your breath

[Verse 2]
I lost you when I lost me, didn't mean to at the time
All the hurt I was feeling in my heart, it made me blind to you
What you'd been through, I paid no mind
Though I meant to and-
All the fire I felt within my bones became eclipsed
Just the touch of your hands, you're heart and, oh my God, your lips
Oh, I just wish that
I just wish that you would

[Chorus]
Would you trust me to catch you at the bottom of the pool
If I told you, my whole heart, that I loved you
That I loved you, that I loved you?
But I'm afraid, I'm scared, of those romantic words, you see?
Ain't it ironic how those are just the songs I sing about?
My lovely, do you really love me?
When I hear you whisper under your breath, "I love you"
I love you
I love you
Oh, it's true, oh-ohh
[Bridge]
Ohh, oh-oh, ohh, oh-oh
Ohh, oh-oh, ohh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Would you trust me to catch you at the bottom of the pool
If I told you, my whole heart, that I loved you
That I loved you, that I loved you?
But I'm afraid, I'm scared, of those romantic words, you see?
Ain't it ironic how those are just the songs I sing about?
My lovely, do you really love me?
