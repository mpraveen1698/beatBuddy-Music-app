Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
No sleep
No sleep until I'm done with finding the answer
Won't stop
Won't stop before I find a cure for this cancer

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes
I feel like goin' down, I'm so disconnected
Somehow
I know that I am haunted to be wanted

[Chorus]
I've been watchin', I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin', I've been livin'
For tomorrows all my life

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
In the shadows
Oh-oh, oh-oh
In the shadows

They say
That I must learn to kill before I can feel safe
But I
I'd rather kill myself than turn into their slave

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes
I feel that I should go and play with the thunder
Somehow
I just don't wanna stay and wait for a wonder

[Chorus]
I've been watchin', I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin', I've been livin'
For tomorrows all my life

[Bridge]
Lately, I've been walkin'
Walkin' in circles, watchin', waitin' for somethin'
Feel me, touch me, heal me, come take me higher

[Chorus]
I've been watchin', I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin', I've been livin'
For tomorrows all my life
[Post-Chorus]
I've been watchin'
I've been waitin'
I've been searchin'
I've been livin' for tomorrows

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
In the shadows
Oh-oh, oh-oh
In the shadows
I've been waitin'6Embed In the Shadows Dead Letters The Rasmus metal
