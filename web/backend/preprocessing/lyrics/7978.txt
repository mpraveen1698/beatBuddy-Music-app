Can you see yourself
Through the bruises when the makeup melts?
In the dark when all the power's out?
Everybody talks and gets around
When the money talks
Do you think it gets the point across?
It's a burning coal you're walking on
And in a second all the pain is gone

[Chorus]
I said "It's enough"
I begged and I ran in circles
I climbed to the sun
And fell in a concrete jungle
I said "It's done"
You never know if you'll get what you wish for
I climbed to the sun
And I fell, I fell
In a concrete junglе

[Verse 2]
The coyotes cry
And the sirеns pass and harmonize
Fires starting every day and night
Burn around us while we're trapped inside
Wouldn't it be nice
To play the game without a crooked die?
In a world where you don't have to hide?
You don't have to live in a disguise

I said "It's enough"
I begged and I ran in circles
I climbed to the sun
And fell in a concrete jungle
I said "It's done"
You never know if you'll get what you wish for
I climbed to the sun
And I fell, I fell
In a concrete jungle

[Breakdown]
And I'm the fucking king
I want things that money can't buy
The price is pain to make this right
And I could buy a thousand lives
So you can try to kill me but I can't fucking die
Die

[Chorus]
I said "It's enough"
I begged and I ran in circles
I climbed to the sun
And fell in a concrete jungle
I said "it's done"
You never know if you'll get what you wish for
I climbed to the sun
And I fell, I fell
In a concrete jungle
In a concrete jungle
