9 ContributorsYou Irritate Me (Demo) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You, you irritate me
Like a tick on a dog's dick gnawing at my veins
I can't stand your face
You're an ugly motherfucker that's taking up too much space

[Chorus]
You're a waste (waste), waste of flesh to me
And no one really wants you
You're a waste (waste), waste of space to me
So rot in hell

[Verse 2]
You, you irritate me
Like a tick on a dog's dick gnawing at its veins
I can't stand your face
You're an ugly motherfucker that's taking way too much space

[Chorus]
You're a waste (waste), waste of flesh to me
And no one really wants you
You're a waste (waste), waste of space to me
So rot in hell
