This is my church
This is where I heal my hurt
It's in the world I've become
Contained in the hum between voice and drum
It's in change
The poetic justice of cause and effect
Respect, love, compassion
This is my church, this is where I heal my hurt
For tonight, God is a DJ

[Drop: Faithless & David Guetta]

[Chorus: Faithless]
The poetic justice of cause and effect
Respect, love, compassion
This is my church, this is where I heal my hurt
For tonight, God is a DJ

[Drop: Faithless & David Guetta]

[Outro: Faithless]
