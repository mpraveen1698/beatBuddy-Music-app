1 ContributorCoral Couch! Lyrics[Verse - ZER0speaks]
Ya sixth sense can't touch my third eye
Trident can’t penetrate my skin
Oh sin
What I be on, Is beyond
Rolling blunts and futons
Keep it wave baby
5 pieces like I’m Voltron
I’m proton
So on you
Like electrons
I elect, suggest
My dialects, is best
On the bedrock
Jellyfish lamps
And a Ted talk
If we lucky baby we can do a crab walk

[Solomon]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Huh, I gotta grip (huh) tentacles
Gotta gift, if you like shapes it's cylindrical
Intervals, can we go in rounds, Billy Ocean
Oh shit, watch out for them sharks and emotions
I'm lurking for some love I can attest
I'm drowning in your waves you are my best
Tidal, only when I'm with you is when I'm feeling vital
I know with you baby girl, yeah I hit the lotto
You might also like[1st part hook - ZER0Speaks]
Crashing waves
Tidal waves
I drift away
I’m here to stay
With you

[2nd part hook - Solomon]
I let you go
You float away
So far away
I don’t know what to do

[ZER0speaks & Solomon]
We can just chill on my couch
We can just chill on my couch

[Verse - ZER0speaks]
Four chambers like my mother fucking heart yeah
Beat right out my chest
Like I be grooving to this shit
I be
Stuck in coral reefs
Up In the bottom of the sea
Sea urchins be lurking so deep (Yeah!)
Flex like the tail of a dolphin
Skill from the gills to the dorsal fin
Just scales no cardigan
Grinch green but I’m grouchin'
And I’m chilling on this couch
Floated down from the surface
Hope where I’m from doesn’t hurt this (Yeah yeah yeah)
Paired fins don’t always match up
Live life playing catch up
But webbed feet make it hard to run on land
So just grab my hand
Baby I’m your man
Your Amphibian
[1st part hook - ZER0Speaks]
Crashing waves
Tidal waves
I Drift away
I’m here to stay
With you

[2nd part hook - Solomon]
I let you go
You float away
So far away
I don’t know what to do

[ZER0speaks & Solomon]
We can just chill on my couch
We can just chill on my couch

[Verse - Solomon]
Beach times
Good vibes
Driving slow in the ride
Drive slow, Slow mo
Just go with the flow
I don't what I'm doing
I'm just tryna figure out what the mood is
Yah I act cocky, baby, blame it on the hubris
That's what the truth is, I love you and the music
With your body moving like that it's hard not to do shit
It's a nuance -  cause we don't know what we doing
Proving, nothing else but the same ole movement
Whatcha doing baby girl, whatcha doing?
I got love and a whole lotta proving
This is the only thing I'm afraid of losing
Sometimes you act like I'ma bother
But only thing you gotta do is step outside your father's
[Verse - ZER0speaks]
Your amphibian
Once again
Once again
Yeah you know me now but you never called my number then
Shell phone ringing
And this ain’t Patrick
Greedy like krabs
And I want your heart
And I need your love
Grip like tentacles
Identical to tentacruels
You skeptical?
For why
My love is plentiful
Babe

[Bridge]
Deep inside your love (Yeah, Yeah)
Deep inside your love (Yeah, Yeah)
Deep inside your love (Yeah, Yeah)
Deep inside your love (Yeah, Yeah)
Deep inside your love (Yeah, Yeah)
Deep inside your love (Yeah, Yeah)
Deep inside your love (Yeah, Yeah)
Deep inside your love (Yeah, Yeah)
Yeah!1Embed I Love You I Love You Patrick Lite;Vitaly Gray deep-house
