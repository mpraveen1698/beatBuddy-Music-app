1 ContributorIsland in the Sun LyricsAnother deadline
Been working all night
Imagination fuels my creation
Press on the gas, going fast
'Cause I'm running outta time

Cities growing to the sky and I
I see those brights lights
I gotta slow down
Back to my high ground

Building walls, need to run
To an island in the sun
To an island in the sun

Building walls, need to run
To an island in the sun
Building walls, need to run
To an island in the sun
To an island in the sun

The happy faces everyone's chasing
My reputation burns my creation
Press on the gas, going fast
'Cause we're running outta time
You might also likeEndless waiting in the line and I
I see those brights lights
I gotta slow down
Back to my high ground

Building walls, need to run
To an island in the sun
To an island in the sun
Building walls, need to run
To an island in the sun

Building walls, need to run
To an island in the sun
To an island in the sun

Building walls, need to run
To an island in the sun
To an island in the sun
To an island in the sunEmbed Island in the Sun Island in the Sun GAMPER & DADONI;Conor Byrne deep-house
