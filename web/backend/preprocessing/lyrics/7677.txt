San Francisco, where's your disco?
San Francisco, where's your disco?

[Verse]
I was supposed to go out there for like a semester of college and I ended up never leaving
It's that energy on the dance floor that I think has helped house music completely thrive from there
There is definitely the leftover hippie lives from the '60s and '70s I think
It's just a great place to go out, there's something going on every night of the week, the people there are fun and just
Yeah, I love it

[Chorus]
San Francisco, where's your disco?

[Verse]
I first moved there in 1999
I was supposed to go out there for like a semester of college and I ended up never leaving
It's that energy on the dance floor that I think has helped house music completely thrive from there
There is definitely the leftover hippie lives from the '60s and '70s I think
It's just a great place to go out, there's something going on every night of the week, the people there are fun and just
Yeah, I love it
