Mm, mm

[Verse 1: MAX]
You could give me chills on a summer day, yeah
When we're layin' still but you make my heart race
Gonna keep me young when we're old and grey
I know that time moves on, but some things don't change

[Chorus: MAX]
I won't stop getting butterflies, I
Get 'em every time
I look into your eyes
You won't stop runnin' through my mind
For the rest of both our lives
You give me butterflies
And I keep on getting butterflies

[Verse 2: Ali Gatie]
I still fall in love with you every time I see your eyes
It takes me back to the first time I saw you smile
They told us we were young and dumb, we didn't know 'bout love
Now look at all the things we've become

[Chorus: MAX & Ali Gatie]
I won't stop getting butterflies, I
Get 'em every time
I look into your eyes
You won't stop runnin' through my mind
For the rest of both our lives
You give me butterflies
I keep on getting (Keep on getting)
I keep on getting (Keep on getting)
I keep on getting (Keep on getting)
Butterflies

[Pre-Chorus: MAX, MAX & Ali Gatie]
And I won't stop getting butterflies, I
Get 'em every time, yeah
I get 'em every time, I

[Chorus: MAX, Ali Gatie & Both]
I won't stop getting butterflies, I
Get 'em every time
I look into your eyes
You won't stop runnin' through my mind
For the rest of both our lives
You give me butterflies
I keep on getting (Keep on getting)
I keep on getting (Keep on getting)
I keep on getting (Keep on getting)
Butterflies
