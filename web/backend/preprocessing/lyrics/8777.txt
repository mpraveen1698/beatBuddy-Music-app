5 ContributorsWhat It Feels Like Lyrics[Intro]
Do you feel love?

[Verse 1]
Oh, tell me what it feels like to be loved by you
I just want it all night if it's alright with you
And I keep getting stuck on this feeling
And my body is losing control
'Cause I just wanna know what it
Feels like to be loved by

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me what it feels like to be loved by you
I just want it all night to be loved by
To be loved by you
I just want it all night if it's alright

[Bridge]
Tell me, tell me what it
Tell me, tell me what it
Tell me, tell me what it
Tell me

[Verse 2]
Oh, tell me what it feels like to be loved by you
I just want it all night if it's alright with you
And I keep getting stuck on this feeling
And my body is losing control
'Cause I just wanna know what it
Feels like to be loved by
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, tell me what it feels like to be loved by you
I just want it all night to be loved by
Loved by you
I just want it all night to be loved by
