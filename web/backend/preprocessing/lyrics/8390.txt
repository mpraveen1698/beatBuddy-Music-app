11 PM, she walked in with her friends
And now I'm trippin' off the deep end (Deep end)
So call me a Lyft or a black hearse
'Cause I know you'll make my head spin, yeah
And I said, "What's your favorite color?"
She pointed at her waist
And I said, "That's not a color, it's a shade"
She said, "Don't disagree with me"

[Chorus]
And then she walked away, I didn't get her name
I can't explain the look on her face (Woo)
She wore a sweater in summer weather, yeah
She wore a sweatеr, it was funeral grey
And now it's killing me
I just want you to bе my next mistake that I'm gonna make (Oh)
She wore a sweater in summer weather, yeah
She wore a sweater, it was funeral grey

[Verse 2]
3 AM, she walked in, took a hit
I said, ''That shit is gonna kill you'' (kill you)
She kinda smiled and she blew it in my face
And said ''Well, now you're gonna die too''
I said that you can call me, beep me if you want my skin
She rolled her eyes, and then she said
"I know your dying wish is to be baptized in my spit"
You might also like[Chorus]
And then she walked away, I didn't get her name
I can't explain the look on her face
She wore a sweater in summer weather, yeah
She wore a sweater, it was funeral grey
And now it's killing me
I just want you to be my next mistake that I'm gonna make (Oh)
She wore a sweater in summer weather, yeah
She wore a sweater, it was funeral grey

[Post-Chorus]
Float my way, I'm melting for you
Float my way, I'm melting for you

[Chorus]
She walked away, I didn't get her name
I can't explain the look on her face
She wore a sweater in summer weather, yeah
She wore a sweater, it was funeral grey
And now it's killing me
I just want you to be my next mistake that I'm gonna make (Oh)
She wore a sweater in summer weather, yeah
She wore a sweater, it was funeral grey

[Post-Chorus]
Float my way, I'm melting for you
Float my way, I'm melting for you8Embed FUNERAL GREY FUNERAL GREY Waterparks punk-rock
