N-n-n-n-n-n-no way
There's no way
You must agree that baby
In all the time I've been by your side
I've never lost control
No matter how many times I knew you lied
Have my golden rule
Got to keep my cool
Yeah, baby

[ENSEMBLE]
You know she's got to keep her cool

[CATHERINE OF ARAGON]
And even though you've had your fun
Running around with some pretty young thing
𝘗𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘵𝘺 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨
And even though you've had one son
With someone who don't own a wedding ring
𝘞𝘦𝘥𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨
No matter what I heard
I didn't say a word
No, baby

[ENSEMBLE]
You know she never said a word

I put up with your sh—
Like every single day
𝘞𝘰𝘢𝘩, 𝘞𝘰𝘢𝘩
But now it's time to shh
And listen when I say
Woo!

You must think that I'm crazy
You wanna replace me?
Baby, there's n-n-n-n-n-n-no way
If you think for a moment
I'd grant you annulment, just hold up
There's n-n-n-n-n-n-no way

No way
No way
There's n-n-n-n-n-n-no way

No way
No way
There's n-n-n-n-n-n-no way

There's no way
So you read a Bible verse that I'm cursed
'Cause I was your brother's wife
You say it's a pity 'cause, quoting Leviticus
I'll end up kiddy-less all my life
Well, daddy, weren't you there
When I gave birth to Mary?
(spoken)
Aw, hi, baby!

[ENSEMBLE]
Daughters are so easy to forget

[CATHERINE OF ARAGON]
You're just so full of sh—
Must think that I'm naïve
I won't back down, won't shh
And, no, I'll never leave
(Oh!)

CATHERINE OF ARAGON, 𝘌𝘯𝘴𝘦𝘮𝘣𝘭𝘦
You must think that I'm crazy
You wanna replace me?
Baby, there's n-n-n-n-n-n-no way
If you thought it'd be funny
To send me to a nunnery
Honey, there's no way

No way
No way
There's n-n-n-n-n-n-no way

No way
No way
There's n-n-n-n-n-n-no way
There's no way
Hey!

(Woo!)
(Let's go!)
(Woo!)
(Here we go!)

You've got me down on my knees
Please tell me what you think I've done wrong
Been humble, been loyal, I've tried
To swallow my pride all along
If you can just explain
A single thing I've done to cause you pain
I'll go

(spoken)
No?

[sung]
You've got nothing to say
I'm not going away
There's no way

You must think that I'm crazy
You wanna replace me?
Baby, there's n-n-n-n-n-n-no way
You made me your wife
So I'll be queen till the end of my life
N-n-n-n-n-n-no way

No way
No way

N-n-n-n-nope n-nope, n-nope no! (No way)
No! (No way)

There's n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-no way

There's no way!7Embed No Way Six: The Musical (Studio Cast Recording) SIX;Renée Lamb show-tunes
