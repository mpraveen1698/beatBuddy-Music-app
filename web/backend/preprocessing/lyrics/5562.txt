I walk the streets of Japan 'til I get lost
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
With a graveyard tan carrying a cross
Yeah, it doesn't remind me of anything
I like studying faces in parking lot
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like drivin' backwards in the fog
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything

[Chorus 1]
The things that I've loved, things that I've lost
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
I don't wanna learn what I'll need to forget

[Verse 2]
I like gypsy moths and radio talk
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like gospel music and canned applause
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like colorful clothing in the sun
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like hammering nails and speaking in tongues
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
You might also like[Chorus 2]
The things that I've loved, things that I've lost
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
Don't wanna learn what I'll need...

[Bridge]
Bend and shape me, I love the way you are
Slow and sweetly like never before
Calm and sleeping, we won't stir up the past
So discreetly we won't look back

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 2]
The things that I've loved, things that I've lost
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
I don't wanna learn what I'll need

[Outro]
I like throwing my voice and breaking guitars
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like playin' in the sand, what's mine is ours
If it doesn't remind me of anything6Embed Doesn't Remind Me Out of Exile Audioslave grunge
