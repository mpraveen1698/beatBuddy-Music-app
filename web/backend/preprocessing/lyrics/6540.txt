19 Contributors17 Lyrics[Verse 1]
I would need a million words
If I tried to define
All the things you mean to me, yeah
For you, I'd die a thousand lives
Special kind of energy
’Cause love is born when hearts collide
Every time you touch me
You remind me that I'm still alive

[Chorus]
So promise you'll never change
And I’ll always be the same
We'll be dancing the same groove when we're ninety-two
The same as seventeen
And I'll never lie to you
Just don't you hold back on me
I wanna love you as strong when we're ninety-two
The same as seventeen

[Verse 2]
I don't really know what's right
But I could never call you wrong
I just wanna dance wit’ you
Floatin’ over marble floors
You're something like an angel
You do something to my mind
I could see a thousand years
When I’m lookin' in your eyes
You might also like[Chorus]
So promise you'll never change
And I'll always be the same
We’ll be dancing the same groove when we're ninety-two
The same as seventeen
And I'll never lie to you
Just don't you hold back on me
I wanna love you as strong when we're ninety-two
The same as seventeen

[Outro]
Just promise you'll never change
And I'll always be the same
We'll be dancing the same groove when we're ninety-two
The same as seventeen
And I'll never lie to you
Just don't you hold back on me
I wanna love you as strong when we're ninety-two
The same as seventeen2Embed 17 17 Pink Sweat$ soul
