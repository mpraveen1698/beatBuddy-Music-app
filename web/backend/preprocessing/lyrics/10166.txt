6 ContributorsI Will Spend My Whole Life Loving You Lyrics[Verse 1]
August afternoon
I can picture you
Walking with your father at your side
In the summer heat
California speaks
Softly like she's making up her mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, as I stand beside you I say

[Chorus]
Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die?
Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars
'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you

[Verse 2]
Through your shining eyes
Sweet like Jeffrey Pines
I pretended I could read your thoughts
Now it's just the truth
Seems our hearts have fused
Soldered like the gold your sister brought

[Pre-Chorus]
And how am I lucky enough to say
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die?
Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars
'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you

[Bridge]
Loving you, loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I said

[Chorus]
Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die?
Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars
'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you2Embed I Will Spend My Whole Life Loving You I Will Spend My Whole Life Loving You Imaginary Future;Kina Grannis folk
