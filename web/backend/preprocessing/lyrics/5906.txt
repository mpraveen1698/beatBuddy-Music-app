He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah
He-eh-eh-eh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Stand up, you don't have to be afraid
Get down, love is like a hurricane
Street boy, no, I never could be tamed, better believe it
Guilty till I'm proven innocent
Whiplash, heavy metal accident
Rock on, I want to be president

[Chorus]
I love it
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, don't want no compromise

[Verse 2]
Turn it up, hungry for the medicine
Two-fisted to the very end
No more treated like aliens, we're not gonna take it
No lies, no more alibis
Turn it up, got me hypnotized
Rock on, won't be tranquilized

Loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud, don't want no compromise
