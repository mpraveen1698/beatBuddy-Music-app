I don't know what to do without you
I don't know where to put my hands
I've been trying to lay my head down
But I'm writing this at 3 a.m

[Chorus]
I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

[Verse 2]
On sunny days, I go out walking
I end up on a tree-lined street
I look up at the gaps of sunlight
I miss you more than anything

[Chorus]
I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

[Outro]
And autumn comes when you're not yet done
With the summer passing by, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see meSee Mitski LiveGet tickets as low as $8You might also like26Embed Francis Forever Bury Me At Makeout Creek Mitski indie-pop
