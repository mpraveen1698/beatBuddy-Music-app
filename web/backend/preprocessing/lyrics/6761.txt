4 ContributorsWish It Was You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't know why
That gettin' over you is takin' all my time
I don't know
Oh, am I
Rememberin' us right or was it all a lie?
I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now I'm busy drinkin'
Wonderin' what you're thinkin'
Lookin' for the answers in somebody else
And we're in different cities
Tell me, do you miss me?
You still know me better than I know myself

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, I'm right where I started
Kissin' his lips and pretendin' it's you
I know it was right that we parted
But every time I think I've found someone new
I wish it was you
I wish it was you
I wish it was you, ooh, ooh
I wish it was you
I wish it was you
I wish it was you, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I don't know why
That I keep lookin' for you in another's eyes
I don't know
But every time
I think I'm gettin' closer, it just isn't right
I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now I'm busy drinkin'
Wonderin' what you're thinkin'
Lookin' for the answers in somebody else
And we're in different cities
Tell me, do you miss me?
You still know me better than I know myself

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, I'm right where I started
Kissin' his lips and pretendin' it's you
I know it was right that we parted
But every time I think I've found someone new
I wish it was you
I wish it was you
I wish it was you
[Drop]
I wish it was you
I wish it was you
I wish it was you, ooh, ooh
I wish it was you
I wish it was you
I wish it was you, ooh, oohEmbed Wish It Was You Wish It Was You Audien;Cate Downey progressive-house
