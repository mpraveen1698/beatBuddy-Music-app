23 Contributors(Youâ€™re the) Devil in Disguise Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
You look like an angel (look like an angel)
Walk like an angel (Walk like an angel)
Talk like an angel
But I got wise

[Chorus]
You're the devil in disguise
Oh, yes you are
The devil in disguise
Mmm-hmm-mmm

[Post-Chorus]
You fooled me with your kisses
You cheated and you schemed
Heaven knows how you lied to me
You're not the way you seemed

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like an angel (look like an angel)
Walk like an angel (Walk like an angel)
Talk like an angel
But I got wise

[Chorus]
You're the devil in disguise
Oh, yes you are
The devil in disguise
Mmm-hmm-mmm
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
I thought that I was in heaven
But I was sure surprised
Heaven help me, I didn't see
The devil in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like an angel (look like an angel)
Walk like an angel (Walk like an angel)
Talk like an angel
But I got wise

[Chorus]
You're the devil in disguise
Oh, yes you are
The devil in disguise
Mmm-hmm-mmm
