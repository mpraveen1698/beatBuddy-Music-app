It kills me not to know this, but I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face, that this world has forgotten

[Verse 1]
There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can't break through until we disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me now
If this ain't love, then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

[Chorus]
That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!"
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

[Verse 2]
And the day pressed on like crushing weights, for no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand, uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand, now do you understand?

So, tell me now
If this ain't love, then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

[Chorus]
That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!"
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

[Bridge]
One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know
We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
It takes me under, it takes me under once again...

[Interlude]
I don't hate you...
I don't hate you, no...

[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know
[Chorus]
That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!"
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

[Outro]
I don't hate you
I don't hate you
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
I don't hate you
I don't hate you, no
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!51Embed Savior Appeal To Reason Rise Against punk
