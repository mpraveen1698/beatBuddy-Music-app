2 ContributorsGimme! Gimme! Gimme! LyricsAnd I'm watchin' the late show
In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Blowin' outside the window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Movie stars
From the end of the rainbow
With a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
(Tired of TV)
I open the window
And I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnightYou might also likeEmbed Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! GAMPER & DADONI deep-house
