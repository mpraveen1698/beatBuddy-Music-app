3 Contributors​never fall in love with strangers Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not the type to spend a late night with a stranger
But it happened to be you

Got my friends back at the bar
Think they probably stole my card
But what else is there to do

Said you
Got a place by the beach
With a few friends
Just an hour away
As we were leaving

Move the mess to the back
To clear the seats
And now it's just me and you

[Chorus x2]
And we
We got a lot in common suddenly
We're looking at the sun
I'll spend the night with you
And I'll be rеal with you
I never fall in love with strangеrs

Said you wanna be a model
Write a novel
Take a second shot at college
Gain some knowledge

Really wanna make some dollars
Be a scholar
Got your life in front of you

Tryna be somebody
Not just anybody
Got a pocket full of dreams
Nobody stopping

I should be heading home
But something's got me locked
Right onto you

[Chorus x2]
And we
We got a lot in common suddenly
We're looking at the sun
I'll spend the night with you
And I'll be real with you
I never fall in love with strangers
[Outro x2]
I, I never
I, I never fall in love
I, I never
I never fall in love with strangers

[Chorus]
And we
We got a lot in common suddenly
We're looking at the sun
I'll spend the night with you
And I'll be real with you
I never fall in love with strangers

I never fall in love with strangersEmbed never fall in love with strangers dancefloor marcos g chill
