I don't know, it's just something about ya (Woo)
Got me feelin' like I can't be without ya (Woo)
Anytime someone mention your name (Woo)
I be feelin' as if I'm around ya (Woo)
Ain't no words to describe you, baby (Woo)
All I know is that you take me high (Woo)
Can you tell that you drive me crazy? (Woo)
'Cause I can't get you out my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Think of you when I'm going to bed
When I wake up, think of you again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why

[Chorus]
You light me up inside
Like the Fourth of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well, you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror
And singing in the shower (Shower)
