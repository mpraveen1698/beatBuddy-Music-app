Why do I do this?
Pick you up and put you down and put you through this

[Verse]
Started off as a good thing, a sure thing
You held back, but I know
In the moment our lips touched
The rush sent us straight to the moon
I should've known that we'd be coming down
Right to the bottom where we are now, mmm
Started off as a good thing, a sure thing
What the hell did I do? Yeah

[Chorus]
Every time I think I love somebody
Always find a way to throw it all away
I don't ever wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna be the one to say
That we gotta have a conversation
I don't wanna watch the tears roll down your face
No, I hurt you and I, I'm sorry
All I wanted was to love somebody

[Post-Chorus]
Why do I do this?
