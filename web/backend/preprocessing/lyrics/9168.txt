18 ContributorsBlack No. 1 (Little Miss Scare-All) Lyrics[Intro: Peter Steele]
I went looking for trouble
And boy, I found her

[Verse 1: Peter Steele]
She's in love with herself, she likes the dark
And on her milk-white neck: The Devil's mark
Now it's All Hallows Eve, the moon is full
But will she trick or treat? I bet she will

She will!
Happy Halloween, baby

[Verse 2: Peter Steele]
She's got a date at midnight with Nosferatu
Oh baby, Lily Munster ain't got nothing on you
Well, when I called her evil she just laughed
Well, cast that spell on me, boo bitch-craft

[Pre-Chorus: Kenny Hickey]
Yeah, you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye 'em black
Ooh, dye 'em black

[Chorus: Peter Steele]
Black, black, black, black number one
Black, black, black, black number one
You might also like[Verse 3: Peter Steele]
Little wolf-skin boots and clove cigarettes
An erotic funeral for which she's dressed
Her perfume smells like burning leaves
Every day is Halloween

[Pre-Chorus: Kenny Hickey]
Yeah, you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye 'em black
Ooh, dye 'em black

[Chorus: Peter Steele & Kenny Hickey]
Black, black, black, black number one
(She dyes 'em black)
Black, black, black, black number one
(Black number one)

[Bridge: Peter Steele]

Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead

Loving you
Love, loving you
Was like loving the dead
Was like fucking the dead

[Refrain: Kenny Hickey]
Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead

Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
[Chorus: Peter Steele & Kenny Hickey]
Black, black, black, black number one

Black, black, black, black number one
(Black number one, ooh yeah)
