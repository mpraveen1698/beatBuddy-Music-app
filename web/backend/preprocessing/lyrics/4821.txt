You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid turned it blue

[Verse 2]
Something better than nothing
Something better than nothing, it's giving up
We all need to do something
Try to keep the truth from showing up

[Chorus 1]
How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?
How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?
How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?

[Verse 3]
You're given a flower
But I guess that there's just no pleasing you
Your lip tastes sour
But you think that it's just me teasing you
You might also like[Verse 1]
You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid turned it blue

[Chorus 2]
Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway
Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway
Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway

[Verse 1]
You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid turned it blue5Embed Blue Orchid Get Behind Me Satan The White Stripes blues
