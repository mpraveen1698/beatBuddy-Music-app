1 ContributorTurning Memories LyricsStart praying for that night
Where everything used to lie
Useless this search of day
No guiding light
Days can not show a path
To lay in as forward passing
Sow rewind what is to come
Show me

Come forth and bring me back
To see the end
No turning memory
Can hide the truth

Careless layers you build upon
Abuse me like you have no one
Hopeless to seek new ways
What’s done is done
Tides will now overcome
To fit in a new beginning
So rewind what is to come
Show me

Come forth and bring...

Come forth and bring...
You might also likeYour idеntity separates the thrеads of my heart
Your visionary under state has revealed it’s truth
Now come forth and show me your none given reverence
Now try to unite me in your mark of sinEmbed Dione Dione Teide piano
