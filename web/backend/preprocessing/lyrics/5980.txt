13 ContributorsB.Y.S. Lyrics[Intro]
(keshi)

[Verse 1: keshi]
Said you tired of the distance
You tired of the fake love
Say you don’t really miss him
But I don’t really blame ya
Don’t need nobody else
Don’t need nobody help, mmm
You get it on your own
So why you beside yourself?

[Refrain: keshi]
So afraid to give and take your pain
(Know better, but I pay no mind)
(Get me inside ‘fore I go one time)
So afraid to give your love away
(Know better, but I pay no mind)
(Get me inside ‘fore I go one time)

[Pre-Chorus: keshi & Karencici]
You don’t gotta worry 'bout nothin'
Baby girl, you know that I ain't leavin'
Don’t cry, alright?
Don’t cry, alright?

[Verse 2: keshi]
Say you wanna talk til' the sunrise
I don’t really mind if we stayin' up
Say you got work, but it’s alright
Hope I make you feel a little better (Oh)
Singing you love songs
Tell me I got you all wrong
So you can run away

[Refrain: keshi]
So afraid to give and take your pain
(Know better, but I pay no mind)
(Pull me close, love me not)
(When you're low, hit me up, babe)
So afraid to give your love away
(Know better, but I pay no mind)
(Take your clothes, love me lots)
(On my phone, hit me up, babe)
[Pre-Chorus: keshi & Karencici]
You don’t gotta worry 'bout nothin'
Baby girl, you know that I ain't leavin'
Don’t cry, alright?
Don’t cry, alright?

Say you wanna spend the night
Then you all undecided (Ayy)
Baby, go make yo' mind
Baby, go make yo' mind

Girl, you know that I— girl, you know that I—
