18 ContributorsRenegade Lyrics[Verse 1: Aaryan Shah]
Keep your hands right there
I popped two more, she's in my mind somewhere
Won't let my mind go there
I took too much, don't let me drive nowhere, oh
Keep your eyes on mine
And if you want I'll tell you lies
Tell you I'm yours for life
And tell your friend she's next in line

[Hook: Aaryan Shah]
Ohh, should've listened to them
Ohh, don't you know what I am?
Ohh, didn't you listen to them?
Ohh, don't you know what I am?

[Verse 2: Aaryan Shah]
Keep the drugs real close
One more line before I overdose
And no one ever knows
She's on my mind when I'm on yours
I'm not here for games
I told you what it is, you chose to stay
Baby, you chose the pain
Cause you don't know me, you just know my name
You might also like[Hook: Aaryan Shah]
Ohh, should've listened to them
Ohh, don't you know what I am?
Ohh, didn't you listen to them?
Ohh, don't you know what I am?
