3 ContributorsWasted LyricsI'm drinking up
I'm so wasted
I've had three shots of JD
And four rounds of gin
Some j√§germeister in my belly
I'm about to win

I'm freaking drunk
I'm so wasted
Tequila in the glass
Lime and salt in the hand
Just put it in your system
You're the strongest man

I'm sober now, no, that's a lie
I'm so wasted, yeah
I see colors in the sky
My head is spinning 'round
Somebody help me now
I'm falling to the ground

I'm freaking drunk, oh no
I'm so wasted (take my order)
I want a last shot of whiskey
And a beer to chase
Take that absinthe, pour it all over my face, yeahYou might also likeEmbed Wasted Vikram (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Anirudh Ravichander hip-hop
