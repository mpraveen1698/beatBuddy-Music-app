34 ContributorsI Hear a Symphony Lyrics[Verse 1]
I used to hear a simple song
That was until you came along
Now in its place is something new
I hear it when I look at you

[Verse 2]
With simple songs I wanted more
Perfection is so quick to bore
You are more beautiful by far
Our flaws are who we really are

[Verse 3]
I used to hear a simple song
That was until you came along
You took my broken melody
And now I hear a symphony

[Outro]
And now I hear
