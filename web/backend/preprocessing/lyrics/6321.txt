It was only one time
I was obsessive, a little compulsive
Wondering what it'd be like without you
Yeah it was only one night
I felt the wind in my hair
But I wasn't prepared
For what it'd feel like
Without you

[Pre-Chorus]
So I start giving less and less, and less
And you start wanting more, and more and more
Now I just gotta get it off my chest
That you just ain't the one no more

[Chorus]
I had a thought
That turned into a thing
A noise up in my head
Then it turned into a ring
I thought I'd always love you
But now I can't
Ooh, I started an avalanche
I had a thought
That turned into a thing
A noise up in my head
Then it turned into a ring
I thought I'd always love you
But now I can't
Ooh, I started an avalanchе

Thought I was gonna miss you
But I don't, no I don't, no I don't
And now we got a situation
These thoughts that startеd in my head
So cold had a snowball effect
Oh no, I tried, I can't outrun
The damage is already done

[Chorus]
I had a thought
That turned into a thing
A noise up in my head
Then it turned into a ring
I thought I'd always love you
But now I can't
Ooh, I started an avalanche
I had a thought
That turned into a thing
A noise up in my head
Then it turned into a ring
I thought I'd always love you
But now I can't
Ooh, I started an avalanche

[Post-Chorus]
I started, I started, I started a
I started an avalanche
I started, I started, I started a
I started an avalanche
[Bridge]
So I start giving less and less, and less
And you start wanting more, and more and more
Now I just gotta get it off my chest
That you just ain't the one no more

[Chorus]
I had a thought
That turned into a thing
A noise up in my head
Then it turned into a ring
I thought I'd always love you
But now I can't
Ooh, I started an avalanche
I had a thought
That turned into a thing
A noise up in my head
Then it turned into a ring
I thought I'd always love you
But now I can't
Ooh, I started an avalanche
(I started an avalanche)
