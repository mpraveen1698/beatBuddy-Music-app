7 ContributorsThe Simple Things Lyrics[Chorus]
And it's the simple things you do
I just can't get enough of you
It's that perfume that you wear
And the way you do your hair
That I love so much
And it's the simple things you say
And how in bed we play
It's the way you kiss my cheek
When you think that I'm asleep
I love it so much

[Verse 1]
"I love you" words I never say
Friends make fun but I tell you everyday
Anyway, lately you've been getting me home safely
Wake up love the coffee that you make me
Asking me how my night was
I like us
It's so easy and we don't ever fight cause
You don't blow up my phone
When you're home alone assuming
That I'm doin' what a guy does
Trust, with just the right amount of lust
Even loved by my family that's a must
And fun everything we do me and you
My song comes on and you dance and sing too
With the windows down like geez
We don't care who's around or who sees
And everyone is jealous of my ride
Because you're sitting in the passengers side
You might also like[Chorus]
And It's the simple things you do
I just can't get enough of you
It's that perfume that you wear
And the way you do your hair
That I love so much
It's the simple things you say
And how in bed we play
It's the way you kiss my cheek
When you think that I'm asleep
I love it so much

[Verse 2]
Everyday scrubbin' it lovin' it
Crusin' freeways in our PJs
'Cause that's the fun of it unless
You wear that pretty black dress oh yes
Catch me in a suit so I can look as good as you
But I don't, oh well
With that smile that you wear so well
And the way that you cry in movies
Pass you the ball and pass it back to me
Beers with the guys
Ain't no thing
It's your eyes and the simple things
That make this work like it should
When you rock my shirt
Oh, you look so good
So take my hand and stay as long as you can with the man
That tells all the jokes only you understand
And I promise to be honest if you promise to accomplish love
All we need is love
[Chorus]
And it's the simple things you do
I just can't get enough of you
It's that perfume that you wear
And the way you do your hair
That I love so much
And it's the simple things you say
And how in bed we play
It's the way you kiss my cheek
When you think that I'm asleep
I love it so much3Embed The Simple Things Love Adolescent Michael Carreon chill
