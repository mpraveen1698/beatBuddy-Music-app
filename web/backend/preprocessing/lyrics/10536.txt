Rude girl, I need you to come closer
Just because I waan fe get to know you
Let's talk and maybe exchange numbers
There's a whole world that I wanna show you
Rude girl, I need you to come closer
Just because I waan fe get to know you
Let's talk and maybe exchange numbers
There's a whole world that I wanna show you

[Chorus: Stamina MC]
And if tings go nice, then we could be in love
And if tings go nice, then tings might happen
We could be in love
And if tings go nice, then we could be in love
And if tings go nice, then tings might happen
We could be in love

[Verse 2: Lily Allen]
Rude boy, you look like a smoker
Got some weed but don't got no Rizla
I can see all the stress that you're under
Come we go and chat shit on the sofa
Rude boy, you seem like a joker
Can I bother you for a lighter?
Is it alright if I ask for your number?
I don't mind if you come a bit closer...

And if things go nice, then we could be in love
And if things go nice, then things might happen
We could be in love
And if things go nice, then we could be in love
And if things go nice, then things might happen
We could be in love

[Outro: Stamina MC]
Let's see if we can inspire an emotion
That's how people can decide it's a vibe

We could be in love
We could be in loveEmbed Roll The Dice (feat. Stamina MC & Lily Allen) Raggamuffin SoundTape SHY FX;Lily Allen;Stamina MC drum-and-bass
