You gotta do it
Yeah, you gotta do it
Every day, every time, in every single place you find yourself
You gotta do it
You gotta go crazy, bruh and that it goes on for forever
Yeah, it does

[Verse 1]
I’m rolling on your wheel now
I’m drinking Hennessy now
I hope you see now

[Chorus]
Say you don burst my eyeglass
You don scatter my plans
See my eye, I don kprass
You put me for ambulance
See what you made me, bitch
See what you made me be
See what you did to me
Oh, God save me please

'Cause the doctor said I burnt my liver
I’ve been drinking, smoking cigars
Used to sing and play my guitar
Now I’m lost in this Sambisa
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Everything I do am
Everything wey you talk, I do am
Everything wey you ask, I do am

Say you don burst my eyeglass
You don scatter my plans
See my eye, I don kprass
You put me for ambulance
See what you made me, bitch
See what you made me be
See what you did to me
