I'll fill you up with bones that can never break
Take you to a darker shade of grey
Warm you like a sun that will never fade
Oooh, ooh

[Chorus]
This is power, this is power
This is power, this is power, power, power
Power
This is power, this is power
This is power, this is power, power, power

[Verse 2]
I'll give you every heart of a hundred souls
You could be the fire to kill the cold
I'll break you like a rock that could never hold
Oooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
This is power, this is power
This is power, this is power, power, power
This is power, power, power

[Chorus]
Power
This is power, this is power
This is power, this is power, power, powerYou might also like1Embed Power Power Hardwell;KSHMR progressive-house
