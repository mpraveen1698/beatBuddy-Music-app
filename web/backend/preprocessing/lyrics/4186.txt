17 ContributorsIf You Want Me To Stay Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you want me to stay
I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
But I am about to go
And then you'll know
For me to stay here, I got to be me

[Verse 2]
You'll never be in doubt
That's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reachin' me by phone
Because I promise I'll be gone for a while

[Verse 3]
And when you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person that you really are now
You got to get it straight
How could I ever be late
When you're my woman taking up my time?

[Verse 4]
Whoa, oh, how could you ever allow
I guess I wonder how
How could you get out of pocket for fun, how, how?
When you know that you're never number two
Number one's gonna be number one

Ohh, ow, oohh
I'll be good, I wish I could
Get this message over to you now

[Verse 6]
When you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person you really are now
I'll be so good
Oh, I wish I could
Get the message over to you now

[Outro]
Oh, yessir
I'm good, man4Embed If You Want Me to Stay Fresh Sly & The Family Stone psych-rock
