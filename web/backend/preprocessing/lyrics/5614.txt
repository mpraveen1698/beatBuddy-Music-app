Hey!
Well my temperature's rising
And my feet left the floor
Crazy people knocking
'Cause they want some more
Let me in baby
I don't know what you got
You better take it easy
This place is hot.You might also likeEmbed Gimme Some Lovin' - Single Mix Gimme Some Lovin' / Blues In F The Spencer Davis Group psych-rock
