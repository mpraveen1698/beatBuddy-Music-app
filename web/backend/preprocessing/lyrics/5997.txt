The situations are irrelevant now
She loves the way that I tease, I love the way that she breathes

[Verse 1]
I touched her ooh, she touched my ahhh, it was the craziest thing
I love the girls who hate to love because they're just like me
A certain girl she took my hand and ran it up her thigh
She licked her lips and pulled my hair, I fall in love for a night

[Pre-Chorus]
She can't behave and I'm just a slave
Don’t worry I'll be gone when the morning comes

[Chorus]
Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened. Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me. Go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins. Dying is your latest fashion

[Verse 2]
The frustration it's a regular thing
I hate the ones who love to hate because they're just like me
A certain girl, she took her hand and put it in my lap
It's way too— fuck!... She said, "Once you have me you'll always come back."
