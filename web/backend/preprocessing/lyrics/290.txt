Lord knows and I think I know it too sometimes
Every time, man, they reachin' out for what’s mine
Lord knows and I think I know it too sometimes
Every time, man, they reachin' out for what's mine

[Chorus: Sierra Kidd, Cheriimoya & Sierra Kidd]
I’ve been awake for days, so we out livin' life in the night
Pray to God, man, I hope I don't die
I've been awake for days, so we out livin' life in the night
Pray to God, man, I hope I don't die in the night
Lord knows and I think I know it too sometimes
Every time, man, they reachin' out for what's mine
Lord knows and I think I know it too sometimes
Every time, man, they reachin’ out for what’s mine

[Verse: Sierra Kidd]
Two-two-two bedrooms, seven little childs, it can't be right
Call my brother, he in prison doin’ time, but we alright
Tried my best just to catch a fuckin' smile
But for now I see myself ain't hittin' the thirty-five

[Chorus: Sierra Kidd, Cheriimoya & Sierra Kidd]
I’ve been awake for days, so we out livin' life in the night
Pray to God, man, I hope I don't die
I've been awake for days, so we out livin' life in the night
Pray to God, man, I hope I don't die in the night
Lord knows and I think I know it too sometimes
Every time, man, they reachin' out for what's mine
Lord knows and I think I know it too sometimes
Every time, man, they reachin' out for what's mineYou might also like11Embed Living Life, In The Night Living Life, In The Night Cheriimoya;Sierra Kidd sad
