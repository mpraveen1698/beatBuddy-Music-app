4 ContributorsRipples Lyrics[Verse 1]
So many ways to say goodbye
Too many godforsaken lies
Still, I'm stuck here thinking why you'd give me this
Heartbreak, I'll never mention again
But love, listen

[Chorus]
I hope you think about me when you're kissing him
And that he takes you to the places we've already been
I hope the ripples in the water
Will make it all a little harder
And in the middle of the night when you close your eyes
I hope you're out of Lucky Strikes, I hope you realize
That the ripples in the water
Will make it all a little harder

[Verse 2]
How many hours must I wait?
How much more trust have I left to give?
'Cause you really got me where it hurts the most
The only thing left is to forgive
But love, listen

[Chorus]
I hope you think about me when you're kissing him
And that he takes you to the places we've already been
I hope the ripples in the water
Will make it all a little harder
And in the middle of the night when you close your eyes
I hope you're out of Lucky Strikes, I hope you realize
That the ripples in the water
Will make it all a little harder
You might also like[Bridge]
You said round ripples from a previous lover
Round ripples from the one to another
Count skipping heartbeats, I wouldn't bother
'Cause if he loves you, then he can have ya
Round ripples from a previous lover
Round ripples from the one to another
Count skipping heartbeats, I wouldn't bother
'Cause if he loves you, then he can have ya

[Chorus]
I hope you think about me when you're kissing him
And that he takes you to the places we've already been
I hope the ripples in the water
Will make it all a little harder
And in the middle of the night when you close your eyes
I hope you're out of Lucky Strikes, I hope you realize
That the ripples in the water
Will make it all a little harder1Embed Ripples Ripples Maximillian songwriter
