5 ContributorsWhen She Loved Me Lyrics[Chorus]
When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together lives within my heart

[Post-Chorus]
And when she was sad, I was there to dry her tears
And once she was happy, so was I
When she loved me

[Verse 1]
Through the summer and the fall
We had each other, that was all
Just she and I together, like it was meant to be
And when she was lonely, I was therе to comfort her
And I knew that she lovеd me

[Verse 2]
So the years went by, I stayed the same
But she began to drift away, I was all alone
Still, I waited for the day
When she’d say, "I will always love you."

[Verse 3]
Lonely and forgotten, never thought she'd look my way
And she smiled and held me, just like she used to do
Like she loved me, when she loved me

When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together lives within my heart
