93 million miles from the Sun, people get ready, get ready
'Cause here it comes it's a light, a beautiful light, over the horizon into our eyes
Oh, my my how beautiful, oh my beautiful mother
She told me, "Son in life you're gonna go far, if you do it right you'll love where you are
Just know, wherever you go, you can always come home"

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 2]
240 thousand miles from the Moon, we've come a long way to belong here
To share this view of the night, a glorious night, over the horizon is another bright sky
Oh, my my how beautiful, oh my irrefutable father
He told me, "Son sometimes it may seem dark, but the absence of the light is a necessary part
Just know, you're never alone, you can always come back home"

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
You can always come back, back

[Bridge]
Every road is a slippery slope
There is always a hand that you can hold on to
Looking deeper through the telescope
You can see that your home's inside of you

Just know, that wherever you go, no you're never alone, you will always get back home
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
