5 Contributorsâ€‹starstruck Lyrics[Intro: Arden Jones]
(Tuned up)
When I brought her to L.A., she was starstruck
How they livin' off of Adderall and Starbucks?
Started asking, "Baby, when can it be my turn?"
To go off lightin' up the sky before I'm stardust
And I don't need a fight in the mornin'
My baby crazy, got me yellin' while I'm yawnin'
She go from naked then to makin' me exhausted, it's exhaustin'

[Chorus: Arden Jones]
So we look both ways and walk down Sunset
'Cause she saw fame and now she's obsessed
With all these fakes, I swear this life is gon' break her down
Her friends said she's changed, she always upset
Versace shades and a Gucci sundress to hide the pain
'Cause this ain't quite what she had planned out

[Verse: Arden Jones]
Yeah, man, I spent a couple years on the West Coast
In time, I find it's getting hard for me to let go
She want whatever she can take to get her mind right
And she ain't never gonna make it, but she'll get close
My heart been hurtin' ever since she said, "You're homesick"
My head been hurtin' since six this mornin'
Proceed with caution, every step is at your own risk
And this is somethin' you ain't seen before

I can't bounce back, when she gets that way with herself
'Cause she's my angel, but she puts herself through hell

[Chorus: Arden Jones]
So we look both ways and walk down Sunset
'Cause she saw fame and now she's obsessed
With all these fakes, I swear this life is gon' break her down
Her friends said she's changed, she always upset
Versace shades and a Gucci sundress to hide the pain
'Cause this ain't quite what she had planned out (Nope)Embed starstruck age tape 7 Arden Jones sad
