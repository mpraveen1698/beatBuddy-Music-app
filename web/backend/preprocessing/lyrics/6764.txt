15 ContributorsMillion Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't do this often, you caught me off guard
All of my friends said you moved out west
You tell me stories underneath sunsets
Could it be more than just one night?
Kiss in the cab ride, head turning left right
Get a ticket for two, to wherever you choose
Drinkin' some red out of the blue

[Pre-Chorus]
You say my name with your accent
Makes me remember, how much I missed ya
Hope you're planning to stay, for a million days
You'll be my summer in December

[Chorus]
Hey boy, trust my intuitions
Always, I'm not superstitious
I got lucky
Stole your heart and it was mine for the taking

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
I'm bad at pretending, you know I'll be true
Sunday mornings and midnight lights
Turn into songs that you watch me write
Stole your sweater on that night
You took a picture, keep by my bedside
So you're mine when you're gone
Baby, please don't be long
I got my ticket to the westside
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You say my name with your accent
Makes me remember, how much I missed ya
Hope you're plannin' to stay, for a million days
You'll be my summer in December

[Chorus]
Hey boy, trust my intuitions
Always, I'm not superstitious
I got lucky
Stole your heart and it was mine for the taking

[Drop]
It was mine for the taking
It was mine for a million days
In a million ways
Stole your heart and I got lucky
Stole your heart and it was mine
In a million ways
For a million days2Embed Million Days Million Days SABAI;Hoang;Claire Ridgely edm
