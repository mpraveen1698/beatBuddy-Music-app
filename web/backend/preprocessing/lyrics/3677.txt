Ayy

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Lately, I been losin' my mind
Certain things I can't find
In the middle of the night
I'm still up, I'm still tryna decide

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Should I drink up? Smoke up?
Need some freedom, freedom, ah, in my life
Should I drink up? Smoke up?
Need some freedom, freedom

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Omah Lay]
Show me a little attention (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
A little attention (Oh, oh)
Show me atten' (Oh, oh, mmm-mmm)
Show me a little attention, yeah, yeah (Oh, oh)
Show me a little attention
[Verse 2: Omah Lay]
Little love and some affection on the side
Little trust and some passion would be nice
It's all I desire
I need it, I cannot deny
Oh, ayy, I don't see something
For my eyеs only
Ain't no emoji, cry him only, ah
Ain't no emoji, my mind's lonely
