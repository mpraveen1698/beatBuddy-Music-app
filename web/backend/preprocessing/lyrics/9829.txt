Lady, I know it was hard
But it's much harder to ignore
There's a chance and I promise
I won't hurt you anymore
Hollywood nights we're romancin'
You can trust me anytime
Somewhere, oh babe, there is someone
Oh, you're dancing in my mind

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh, little queenie
I'm your fool come on
Teach me the rules
I will send an S.O.S. for love
Oh, oh, oh, little queenie
I'm your fool you need love, like I do
I will send an S.O.S. for love

[Chorus]
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling from the stars above
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop

[Instrumental]
