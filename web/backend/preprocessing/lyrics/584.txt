The devil doesn't bargain

[Verse 1]
It's useless, don't do this, it's hubris to try
He's ruthless, you knew this, I told you, didn't I?
He's abusive, elusive, the truth is he lies
I know you don't want to let go

[Pre-Chorus]
And just like before, I can see that you're sure
You can change him, but I know you won't

[Chorus]
The devil doesn't bargain
He'll only break your heart again
It isn't worth it, darling
He's never gonna change
He'll never be Prince Charming
He'll only do you harm again
I don't mean to meddle
But the devil doesn't settle
No, the devil doesn't bargain

[Post-Chorus]
Mm-mm-mm-mm
The devil doesn't bargain
Mm-mm-mm-mm

[Bridge]
And I know you think he'll change this time
But I think that you will find

[Chorus]
The devil doesn't bargain
He'll only break your heart again
It isn't worth it, darling
