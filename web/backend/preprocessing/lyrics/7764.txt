14 ContributorsIOU Lyrics[Intro]
I wish someone would wake me
'Cause I can't sleep at all
Stuck in purgatory
Waiting for the fall
Auditioned all the endings
I find it hard to tell
Is it better to serve in heaven
Or better to reign in hell?

[Verse 1]
Say my name
And watch the fire grow
Curse my name
A demon gets its horns
See my face
The one behind my eyes
I'm a son of a bitch, I'm as bad as it gets
And I'll be that till I die

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish someone would wake me
'Cause I can't sleep at all
Stuck in purgatory
Waiting for the fall
Auditioned all the endings
I find it hard to tell
Is it better to serve in heaven
Or better to reign in hell?

You've never known pain before
Cain before
But I'm gonna show you
You've never been drained before
Shamed before
But I'd love to share
You've never known insane before
Deranged before
I'm here to show you
I owe you nothing

[Verse 2]
Feel my pain (Pain)
I bet you can't relate
Know my rage (Rage)
The one you instigate
Hate this place (Place)
The one in which you hide
The devil I know or the devil I don't
I just can't pick a side

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish someone would wake me
'Cause I can't sleep at all
Stuck in purgatory
Waiting for the fall
Auditioned all the endings
I find it hard to tell
Is it better to serve in heaven
Or better to reign in hell?
[Chorus]
You've never known pain before
Cain before
But I'm gonna show you
You've never been drained before
Shamed before
But I'd love to share
You've never known insane before
Deranged before
I'm here to show you
I owe you nothing

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I wish someone would wake me
Wake me up, wake me up, up
I wish someone would wake me
Wake me up, wake me up, up
I wish someone would wake me
Wake me up, wake me up, up
I wish someone would wake me
Wake me up, wake me up, fuck you

[Chorus]
You've never known pain before
Cain before
But I'm gonna show you
You've never been drained before
Shamed before
But I'd love to share
You've never known insane before
Deranged before
I'm here to show you
I owe you absolutely nothing
