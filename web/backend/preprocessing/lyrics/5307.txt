6 ContributorsGreen Tea & Honey Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
La la la la

[Verse 1: Dane Amar]
Girl you don't know, nah
What you do to me
When I see that crinkle on your nose
I wonder if you fluently just do you
Like you do so effortlessly
I want you right next to me
I want you to be my
Be my, my

[Chorus: Dane Amar & Jareena Montemayor]
Green tea in the morning
Be my, my sugar honey
You're just so great
I wonder girl
I wonder why you love me
It's so lovely, can't complain
One day I'll give you my name
If you're down
If you're down

Be my green tea in the morning
Be my, my sugar honey
You're just so great
I wonder girl
I wonder why you love me
It's so lovely, can't complain
One day I'll give you my name
If you're down
If you're down

I can't describe the feeling you gave
When you blew me away
And I carry that every day
My sunshine and my moon
You're all I wanna do
Every night until we're through
These little moments that we've got (That we've got)
You make me feel like something I'm not
Green tea and honey, babe
So warm and sweet
You're all I need
Just you and me

[Verse 3: Dane Amar]
I said now here we go again
Another verse about how you got me feeling it
I'm feeling very many different types of ways
I just gotta say, I just wanna see you every second of every day
If that's okay then let me know
Yes I got the flow that can make us go afloat
Thirty thousand we won't ever hit below
You're a queen and the world is yours to hold (yeah)

[Verse 4: Dane Amar]
Baby I got you and
Baby you got me
Tell me how you feelin'
Just keep it real and promise we'll find peace
Your smile, it got me
Got me lost at your eyes
Baby I just want you
Want you to go in
Want you to be my
[Chorus: Dane Amar & Jereena Montemayor]
Green tea in the morning
Be my, my sugar honey
You're just so great
I wonder girl
I wonder why you love me
It's so lovely, can't complain
One day I'll give you my name
If you're down
If you're down

Be my green tea in the morning
Be my, my sugar honey
You're just so great
I wonder girl
I wonder why you love me
It's so lovely, can't complain
One day I'll give you my name
If you're down
If you're down3Embed Green Tea & Honey East Daygo Popstar Dane Amar;Jereena Montemayor chill
