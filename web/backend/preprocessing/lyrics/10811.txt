48 ContributorsLovemark Lyrics[Intro: Ouse]
Lovemark, yeah love scars
Can't go far, with my heart
When you come, in my car
All I do, is go fast

[Chorus: Ouse]
Lovemark, yeah love scars
Can’t go far, with my heart
When you come, in my car
All I do, is go fast
For how long, will it last?
I still hang, in the past
I still want, what you have
In my heart, do you care?

[Bridge: Ouse]
Do you care?
Do you care, yeah
Do you care, yeah

[Verse 1: Ouse]
Ayy, hiding my pain
There's poison in my veins
Going insane
The lack of you is driving me crazy
Don't know what I’m saying
There's nothing there that you're saving
And you know that I'm praying
I can't feel the rain
Pop another X pill (Aye)
Always aim for that kill (Aye)
I don't know what I feel (Aye)
Am I dreaming or real? (Aye)
Up for you to decide (Aye)
Am I dead or alive? (Aye)
Wanna come for the ride? (Aye)
A little pain on the side
You might also like[Chorus: Ouse]
Lovemark, yeah love scars
Can't go far, with my heart
When you come, in my car
All I do, is go fast
For how long, will it last?
I still hang, in the past
I still want, what you have
In my heart, do you care?

[Verse 2: Powfu]
I still really want what we both had
Writing all our stories in my notepad
Had you in my sights, but I missed it
I'm an odd number, I’m a misfit
I want some real friends that don’t stab my back
Getting sick of fakes and these heart attacks
My life always filled with hurt
Why do I always get what I don't deserve?
I been acting up with my mood swings
Ain’t feeling shit, no toothaches
You're my weakness, like fruit cake
I might dip this place to a new state
Keep on eating fast food, it feels like I'm starving
Lately I've been messed up, I don’t feel my heartbeat
You said I don't try, but I tried my heart
Left an indent like a sharkbite mark
When you coming back? 'Cause I need you
Slowly I'm dissolving till I'm see-through
[Chorus: Ouse]
Lovemark, yeah love scars
Can't go far, with my heart
When you come, in my car
All I do, is go fast
For how long, will it last?
I still hang, in the past
I still want, what you have
In my heart, do you care?4Embed Lovemark Loners Diary Ouse;Powfu sad
