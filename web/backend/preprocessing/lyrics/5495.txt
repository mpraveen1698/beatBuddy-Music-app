13 ContributorsAt My Worst (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Pink Sweat$]
Can I call you baby? Can you be my friend?
Can you be my lover up until the very end?
Let me show you love, oh, no, pretend
Stick by my side even when the world is caving in, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Pink Sweat$]
Oh, oh, oh, don't, don't you worry
I'll be there whenever you want me

[Chorus: Pink Sweat$]
I need somebody who can love me at my worst
Know I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst

[Post-Chorus: Pink Sweat$]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Will you trust I'm honest when they're tellin' lies?
Can you see what I'm not sayin' from my eyеs?
All I know is love, for you, it's real
It's differеnt from anything that I thought I'd feel
Oh, oh, don't you worry, I'll be there whenever you want me
