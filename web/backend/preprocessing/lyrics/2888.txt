I had thoughts of superstardom, singin' in the mirror
I was flossin', swear that I saw this
Remember when I couldn't stand it, now I got the posture (Yeah)
Finally threw a pair of dice, call me Frankie Scoblete
All just to see your hands jumpin' at the concert, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wouldn't trade it for nothin' (nah)
No, I wouldn't change it ever
It's too long to live it for nothin'
So, this is my mood forever

[Chorus]
Ain't life grand? (Grand)
Only ones I keep around me is my fam
No coincidence, it's always been the plan (what)
And I always keep it trilly with the fans
Oh, ain't life grand? (Grand)
And I love a little whiskey in my hand
Make it disappear then reappear again (no)
Matter fact, I never want this life to end
Until the end, yeah (no)

[Verse 2]
The voices in my head, they used to make me wanna break down
Had me hella weighed down
Had me in a corner, had me beat but I'm okay now
True to what they say, if there's a will, then there's a way out
Took all of my dreams, I took 'em back 'cause I'm awake now, yeah (yeah)
