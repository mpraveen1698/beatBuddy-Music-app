In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life?

[Verse 1]
In the end
As my soul's laid to rest
What is left of my body
Or am I just a shell? (A shell, a shell)
And I have fought
And with flesh and blood I commanded an army
Through it all
I have given my heart for a moment of glory
(I gave it all)

[Chorus]
In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life (oh whoa oh oh)
And who will remember your last goodbye (oh whoa oh oh)
Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

[Post-Chorus]
(I'm not afraid)
(I'm not afraid to die)

Born a saint
Though with every sin I still wanna be holy
I will live again
Who we are
Isn't how we live we are more than our bodies
If I fall I will rise back up and relive my glory

[Chorus]
In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life (oh whoa oh oh)
And who will remember your last goodbye (oh whoa oh oh)
Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life (oh whoa oh oh)
And who will remember your last goodbye (oh whoa oh oh)
Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Who will remember this last goodbye (oh whoa oh oh)
Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

Not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
Not not afraid
I'm not afraid to die!47Embed In The End Wretched and Divine: The Story Of The Wild Ones Black Veil Brides alt-rock
