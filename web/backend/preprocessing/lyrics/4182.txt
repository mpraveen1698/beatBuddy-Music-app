Can you light my love?
Flames glowing bright as the sun
Deeper than oceans you run
Watch as our world has begun

[Pre-Chorus]
Your mind is a stream of colors
Extending beyond our sky
A land of infinite wonders
A billion light years from here now

[Chorus]
Whoa, hey, light my love
Whoa, hey, light my love

[Verse 2]
I have seen pictures of time
The frames still in motion, I find
A grand revolution outlined
Hate bound by fear will unwind

[Pre-Chorus]
Your mind is a stream of colors
Extending beyond our sky
A land of infinite wonders
A billion light years from here now
