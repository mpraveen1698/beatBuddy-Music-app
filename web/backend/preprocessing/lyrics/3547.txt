96 ContributorsBlowinâ€™ in the Wind Lyrics[Verse 1]
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend
Is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse 2]
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend
Is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend
Is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind48Embed Blowin' in the Wind The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Bob Dylan songwriter
