23 ContributorsSave the World Lyrics[Verse 1: John Martin]
Into the streets
We're coming down
We never sleep
Never get tired
Through urban fields
And suburban lights

[Pre-Chorus: John Martin]
Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline
Watch it on primetime
Turn up the love now
Listen up now, turn up the love

[Chorus: John Martin]
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring it back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

[Verse 2: John Martin]
We're far from home
It's for the better
What we dream, it's all that matters
We're on our way, united
