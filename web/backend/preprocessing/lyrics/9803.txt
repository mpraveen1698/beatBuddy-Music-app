Hey little monster, I got my eye on you
Where are you going, where you running to?
Hey little monster, you know it's all ok
I'm gonna love ya, no matter what you say

[Chorus]
I've got love on my fingers
Lust on my tongue
You say you got nothing
So come out and get some
Heartache to heartache
I'm your wolf, I'm your man
I say run little monster
Before you know who I am

[Verse 2]
Hey little creature, tell me what's on your mind
Where've you been hiding? And can I come this time?
So pleased to please ya, and rip that heart off your sleeve
What we discover...

[Chorus]
I've got love on my fingers
Lust on my tongue
You say you got nothing
So come out and get some
Heartache to heartache
I'm your wolf, I'm your man
I say run little monster
Before you know who I am
