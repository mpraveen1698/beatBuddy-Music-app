2 ContributorsUnderwater Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm feelin’ water flowin'
It's drippin’ from the ceilin' to my skin
I need somethin' that's healin', but you just drag me in
You're good at stealin' what you don't own

[Pre-Chorus]
You pull me with your eyes underwater, underwater
Don’t get too close to me
You pull me with your eyes underwater, underwater
Don’t get too close to me

[Chorus]
You pull me with your eyes underw—, underwater
Don't get too close to me
Your eyes underw—, underwater
Don’t get too close to me
Underwater
Don't get too close to me
Your eyes underw—, underwater
Don't get too close to me

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin’ water risin'
And I just keep on breathin' to move on
The only thing that's healin' is when you're close to me
But you're just stealin' what you don't own
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You pull me with your eyes underwater, underwater
Don't get too close to me
You pull me with your eyes underwater, underwater
Don't get too close to me

[Chorus]
You pull me with your eyes underw—, underwater
Don't get too close to me
Your eyes underw—, underwater
Don't get too close to me
Underwater
Don't get too close to me
Your eyes underw—, underwater
Don't get too close to me

[Outro]
You pull me with your eyes underwater, underwater
Don't get too close to me
You pull me with your eyes underwater, underwater
Don't get too close to meEmbed Underwater Underwater Tujamo progressive-house
