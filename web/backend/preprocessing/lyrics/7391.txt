8 ContributorsNo Love Lyrics[Intro: Sainté &  Miraa May ]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Sainté &  Miraa May ]
I was out tryna get my block wage
Never really spoke up on the gram
That way a man could look bait
And them man are two face
Talk bout you plans inna works
Snitch from a pay from a jake
But my guys don’t play (yeah, yeah)
Spin round the blocks all day (yeah, yeah)
Money-racking clean forte
Even on a cold day (yeah, yeah)
Never going home with no pay (yeah, yeah)
And money on our mind foreplay

[Chorus: Sainté,  Miraa May &  Both  ]
Chrome heart for the broken, yeah
I never showed no lovе
'Cause I didn’t want my love getting stolеn, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Remember cold dark nights it was lonely (yeah)
You ain’t try phone me (yeah)
Yeah you had doubt in the kid
Call me
You ain’t try phone me (yeah)
You ain’t tried to phone me

Tried to floor me
Control me
Couldn’t get no love feeling lonely
All I wanted was for you to hold me
Now you really wanna be my homie (homie)
It’s boring
You was never down, didn’t believe (believe)
Could’ve been the one to set you free (free)
You was too busy hating on me
Your jealousy gave me more time (more time)
Now I’m up top singing more life (more life)
Slept on a baddie for real (for real)
You was never bad, baby please (please)
I was too real, follow god's sign
Keep it too real it’s in the bloodline (bloddline)
Now I spot a hater for real (for real)
Spot a hater from a long time
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Sainté,  Miraa May&  Both ]

Yeah you had doubt in the kid
Call me
You ain’t try phone me ( yeah )
You ain’t tried to phone me
Chrome heart for the  broken

'Cause I didn’t want my love getting stolen
Remember cold dark nights it was lonely
And you ain’t try phone me
