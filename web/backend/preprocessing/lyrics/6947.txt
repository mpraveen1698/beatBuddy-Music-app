I can't get no sleep

I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep

(I need to sleep)
Deep in the bosom of the gentle night
Is when I search for the light, Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle and fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear.. Insomnia..

I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep

I used to worry, Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
No electricity, Something's all over me
Greasy insomnia, Please release me and let me dream of
Makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearin' off tights with my teeth

But there's no release, No peace, I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, Open my eyes, Rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, Kept takin' sleepers..
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, The night, I write by candle-light I find insight
From the mental movement

Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. I gets no sleep..

I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep

I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep..

I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep...Embed Insomnia - Radio Edit Pure... 90s Dance Party Faithless trip-hop
