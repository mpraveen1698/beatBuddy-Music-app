1 ContributorGo Solo Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
They say it's a matter of time
A thousand days and the sun won't shine
Before I come back to you

[Chorus]
And I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way

[Verse 2]
For your love, I will go far
I wanna be wherever you are
I know I'm coming back for you
Our love is a river long
The best right in a million wrongs
I know I'm coming back to you

[Chorus]
And I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way
I go solo, oh, I go solo
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
For your love, I will go far
I wanna be wherever you are
I know I'm coming back for you
Our love is a river long
The best right in a million wrongs
I know I'm coming back to you

[Chorus]
And I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way
I go solo, oh, I go solo
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way
And I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me (Ooh)
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I go solo, oh, I go solo (Ooh)
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way (Ooh, ooh, ooh)Embed Go Solo (feat. Tom Rosenthal) Go Solo (feat. Tom Rosenthal) Zwette;Tom Rosenthal german
