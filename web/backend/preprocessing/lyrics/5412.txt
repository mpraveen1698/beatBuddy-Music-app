This night, walk the dead
In a solitary style and crash the cemetery gates
In the dress your husband hates
Way down, mark the grave
Where the searchlights find us drinking by the mausoleum door
And they found you on the bathroom floor

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss you, so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

[Verse 2]
Back home, off the run
Singing songs that make you slit your wrists
It isn't that much fun staring down a loaded gun
So I won't stop dying, won't stop lying
If you want, I'll keep on crying
Did you get what you deserve?
Is this what you always want me for?

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss you, so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

[Post-Chorus]
Way down, way down, way down, way down
Way down, way down, way down, way down

I miss you, I miss you, so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
When will I miss you? When will I miss you so far?
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
Made it so hard

[Post-Chorus]
Way down, way down, way down, way down
Way down, way down, way down, way down, way down34Embed Cemetery Drive Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge My Chemical Romance emo
