Chains on shining, you can see me riding
Cocaine lined up, secrets that I'm hidin'
You don't wanna find out, better off lying
You don't wanna cry now, better off dying
Chains on shining, you can see me riding
Cocaine lined up, secrets that I'm hidin'
You don't wanna find out, better off lying
You don't wanna cry now, better off dyin'

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I'ma dive in, I don't put the time in
Even if I try hard, I ain't gonna make it
We ain't gonna make it
We ain't gonna make it
Baby, I'ma dive in, I don't put the time in
Even if I try hard, I ain't gonna make it
We ain't gonna make it
We ain't gonna make it

[Verse]
I ain't gonna make it
But, I love it when you fake, yeah
Got her little heart in my hand
And I don't wanna break it
I ain't gonna make it
But, I love it when you fake, yeah
Got her little heart in my hand
And I don't wanna break it
