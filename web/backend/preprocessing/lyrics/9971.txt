When Heaven takes you home
And you're at the gates alone
If the grass isn't greener
Come back and check I'm still breathin'
When Heaven takes you home
And you're untouchable
Tell 'em how you back flip through tragic
Show 'em how to struggle, make magic

[Verse 1]
There's nothin' wrong with you
You're perfect, you're cool
You took the best parts of you
Show me what love can do

[Chorus]
When Heaven takes you home
And you're untouchablе
Tell 'em how you back flip through tragic
Show 'em how to strugglе, make magic

[Drop]
Make me small
So I can fit in your pockets when you go

[Chorus]
When Heaven takes you home
And you're at the gates alone
If the grass isn't greener
Come back and check I'm still breathin'
When Heaven takes you home
And you're untouchable
Tell 'em how you back flip through tragic
Show 'em how to struggle, make magic

[Outro]
You showed me, you showed me what love can do
You showed me, you showed me what love can do
You showed me, you showed me what love can do
You showed me, you showed me what love can do
