2 ContributorsForever With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know you've moved on
It's been a long time, but I'm struggling
'Cause lately you're the only thing that's been on my mind
I know we don't talk, we don't talk anymore
But whatever I do, everything just reminds me of you, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I saw you today
I don't know what I'd say

[Chorus]
Do you remember that night in December?
We sat in your car wondering if we would get better
But who would've thought that things would go so wrong
But I'd give up whatever
If I could have forever with you
If I could have forever with you

[Verse 2]
Did you forget?
Forget all the things we had
Forget all the promises you made
Now, how do I explain to myself?
To myself
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
That if I saw you today
I don't know what I'd say

[Chorus]
Do you remember that night in December?
We sat in your car wondering if we would get better
But who would've thought that things would go so wrong
But I'd give up whatever
If I could have forever with you, you, ooh, oh

[Bridge]
Can you tell me it'll all be okay?
Nothing worked out the way I had planned, planned
But if it were up to me
I would still be your man

[Chorus]
Do you remember that night in December?
We sat in your car wondering if we would get better
But who would've thought that things would be so wrong
But I'd give up whatever
If I could have forever with you, you
If I could have forever with you, you, you, you
If I could have forever with you2Embed Forever With You Forever With You Keenan Te songwriter
