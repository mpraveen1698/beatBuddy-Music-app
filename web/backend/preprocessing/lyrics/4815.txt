Down by the river, I was drawn by your grace
Into tempest of oblivion and to the lovers' place
I was stucked in a puddle full of tears and unwise dark doings
Now I know that we've paid unlike
Honey, I know, hey, when we walked arm in arm
I felt like we can throw away the falseness of our past
And I know too, it's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window that's what those lovers do

[Instrumental Interlude]

I felt like we can throw away the falseness of our past
And I know too, it's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window that's what those lovers do
