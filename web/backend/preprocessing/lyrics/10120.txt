15 ContributorsLow Lyrics[Intro]
Don't keep on telling me that I'm gonna pull through
When you don't know low like I do

[Verse 1]
I'm afraid of the things I don’t say
The thoughts in my head that keep me tossing, turning, lying awake
Don't keep on telling me that I'm gonna pull through
When you don't know low like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been running away again
I've been running away again
I’ve been running away again
I’ve been running away again

[Chorus]
I've been running away again
Chasing after all the battles I can never win
I don't think that I can take much more
It feels like I've lost it all (Lost it all)
Who will save me when I can't save myself?

[Verse 2]
Hard to think we were born to live this way
Burning bridges, ripping stitches out to drown the pain
Bleed me out, run me dry, watch the hammer fall
Let the river run and bury me beneath it all
[Breakdown]
Bury me
Bury me beneath it all

[Chorus]
I've been running away again
Chasing after all the battles I can never win
I don't think that I can take much more
It feels like I've lost it all (Lost it all)
Who will save me when I can't save myself?

[Bridge]
Searching for answers
A cure for this cancer
It's all in my head
I'm one step from the edge

[Chorus]
I've been running away again
Chasing after all the battles I can never win
I don't think that I can take much more
It feels like I've lost it all
I've been running away again
Chasing after all the battles I can never win
I don't think that I can take much more
It feels like I've lost it all (Lost it all)
Who will save me when I can't save myself? (Save myself)
Who will save me when I can't save myself?
Save me
[Outro]
