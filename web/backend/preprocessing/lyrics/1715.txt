There lived a ghost...
He was going to be the killer
And feared the most

The eagle is comin
You better start runnin
His blood is rushin
Stunnin and gunnin
The eagle is comin
You better start runnin
His blood is rushin
Stunnin and gunnin
Ah-oh-oh (x8)

Once upon a time
There lived a ghost...
He was going to be the killer
And feared the mostYou might also likeEmbed Vikram - Title Track Vikram (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Anirudh Ravichander hip-hop
