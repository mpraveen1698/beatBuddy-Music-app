70 ContributorsDamn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta Lyrics[Verse 1: Scarface]
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fucking mouth
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights
And niggas always gotta high cap
Showing all his boys how he shot 'em
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got 'em
Now, everything is cool in the mind of a gangsta
'Cause gangsta-ass niggas think deep
Up three-sixty-five, ayo, 24/7
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't sleep
And all I gotta say to you, wannabe, gonnabe
Cocksucking, pussy-eating pranksters
Is when the fire dies down, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
Feeding the poor and helping out with their bills
Although I was born in Jamaica
Now, I'm in the U.S. making deals
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
I mean, one that you don't really know
Riding around town in a drop-top Benz
Hitting switches in my black '64
Now, gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors
Some got killed in the past
But this gangsta here was a smart one
Started living for the Lord and I'll last
Now, all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, pussy-eating, cocksucking pranksters:
When the shit jumps off, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta

Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga knows the play
The real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga Lil J
Now, bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign
And play the role of Little Miss Sweet
But catch the bitch all alone, get the digits, take her out
And end up hitting the ass with the meat
'Cause gangsta-ass niggas be the game-players
And everything's quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't telling off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All you hear is the black from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit do the shit
Hit the pen and let a mothafucka shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
'Cause damn it feels good to be a gangsta

("And now, a word from the President.")

[Verse 4 - J. Prince]
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Getting voted in to the White House
Everything looking good to the people of the world
But the Mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor getting down
Like letting a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you know who
So voters of the world keep supporting me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you Republicans, that helped me win
I sincerely like to thank you
â€™Cause now I got the world swinging from my nuts
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta29Embed Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta Uncut Dope Geto Boys hardcore
