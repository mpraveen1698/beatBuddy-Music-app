2 ContributorsGonna Be Okay Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't listen to the voices inside your head
You're doing just fine
You're trying your best
And no-one ever told you it's all gonna be okay
We're just people never sleeping over stupid shit
We won't remember in the morning
Yeah, we're gonna forget
And no-one ever told you it's all gonna be okay

[Pre-Chorus]
When you lose faith in everything you ever knew
Don't give up on you

[Chorus]
When lifе gets overwhelming
Rеlying on yourself is hard to do
But don't give up on you, no
If you've been lost and lonely
Ashamed to be alone with only you
And no-one left to lose
If it's the last thing that you do
Don't give up on you

[Verse 2]
You've been living off opinions for way too long
Afraid to be right, ashamed to be wrong
And no-one ever told you it's all gonna be okay
Those people always keeping up to keep you down
Stop looking for a reason just to keep 'em around
I know they never told you it's all gonna be okay

When you lose faith in everything you ever knew
Don't give up on you

[Chorus]
When life gets overwhelming
Relying on yourself is hard to do
But don't give up on you, no
If you've been lost and lonely
Ashamed to be alone with only you
And no-one left to lose
If it's the last thing that you do
Don't give up on

[Bridge]
You, there's no-one like you
Yeah, one of one
Never gonna find another like you
Yeah, you, there's no-one like you
Yeah, one of one
Never gonna find another like you
Yeah

[Chorus]
When life gets overwhelming
Relying on yourself is hard to do
But don't give up on you, no
If you've been lost and lonely
Ashamed to be alone with only you
And no-one left to lose
If it's the last thing that you do
Don't give up on you2Embed Gonna Be Okay Gonna Be Okay Brent Morgan songwriter
