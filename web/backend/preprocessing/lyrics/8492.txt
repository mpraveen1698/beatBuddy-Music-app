Do you know what it's like when you wanna go cry
But you can't let out all the feelings inside
So you lay in the bed under blankets and hide
And you let people know that your feeling just fine
And your pillow gets stained with the tears that you cried
And your praying nobody comes in and asks why
And the redness is already takin your eyes
And you wish you could hide it but there's no disguising it

[Post-Chorus]
Cry let it all out go ahead just fall down
I'm scared of me now
I don't want them to carry me out
Lies your filled up with doubt
When I scream no words come out bye
No sit on the couch lеt me hear what you gotta say now

[Bridge]
I'm trapped in my mind
Look up look lеft look right gone
No one's around I've been calling to god but it's hard when my voice wasn't taken by choice
So I keep making noise hoping they hear but they just fear me
I'm trapped in my mind
Look up look left look right gone
No one's around I've been calling to god but it's hard when my voice wasn't taken by choice
So I keep making noise hoping they hear but they just fear me
