50 ContributorsWelcome to Wonderland Lyrics[Verse 1]
Welcome to Wonderland, we've got it all
Potions and pastries that make you grow tall
Forests and cottages, castles and cards that can talk
Welcome to Wonderland, look where you're at
Maddest of hatters, the Cheshire Cat
Magical cabins and lovely white rabbits with clocks

[Chorus]
Dancing through a dream
Underneath the stars
Laughing 'til the morning comes
Everyone that leaves has a heavy heart
Oh, Wonderland, I love

[Verse 2]
Welcome to Wonderland, I'll be your guide
Holding your hand under sapphire skies
Let's go exploring, or we could just go for a walk
Welcome to Wonderland, where should we go?
There's a tea party along down the road
Make an appearance, and maybe they'll sing us a song

[Chorus]
Dancing through a dream
Underneath the stars
Laughing 'til the morning comes
Everyone that leaves has a heavy heart
Oh, Wonderland, I love

Nothing around here is quite as it seems
Not sure if anything's real or a dream
And the only thing sure from the start
Is the song that's inside of your heart
Don't let it leave

[Outro]
If this was a dream, then at least I've got
Memories for when morning comes
Now that I must leave with a heavy heart
Oh, Wonderland, I love23Embed Welcome to Wonderland Welcome to Wonderland Anson Seabra singer-songwriter
