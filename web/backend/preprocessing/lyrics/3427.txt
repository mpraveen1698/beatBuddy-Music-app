27 ContributorsNever Be Alright Lyrics[Verse 1]
Maybe I can be so sad when I'm not
Life can be lonely and I’m stuck up in these thoughts
Everything I'm wanting, I can have it at the top
But I'm at the bottom, I’m surrounded by these rocks
If I had love, would I still feel this lonely?
I was by myself and nobody had to show me
Never gave a fuck, nobody try to know me
Handing out these guns but nobody try to blow me
I don't wanna be here, I just wanna go
Wanna leave my family, everybody that I know
Suicidal thoughts, will they miss me when I go?
Tryna get high, I been riding all the lows
Finally getting sober and it bringing back the pain
Sunny for a minute, now it's cloudy with the rain
Shit falling down and it bringing back mistakes
Future looking blurry, I don't see it in my fate

[Chorus]
Why, oh why
I don't wanna be here, I just wanna die
Always been sad, i'll never be alright
Why, oh why
I don't wanna be here, I just wanna die
Always been sad, it'll never be alright

Please come and save me, I really need saving
These are not just lyrics, I’m really not playing
This life that I’m living, I feel like I'm faking
If I can’t be real then it's time for the taking
Come take my life and my soul, when I'm not even old
I've been searching for hot ’cause my heart is so cold
Say I don't listen, not doing I'm told
Don't fit the system, I'll never be gold
If I hit escape would I just fall and go to hell?
Moses say I would but who is he to go and tell?
Wanna judge me now but not gon' hear me when I yell
I've been crying out, steady asking for some help
Nobody wanna talk, nobody picking up the vibes
Smile on my face but they can tell that it's a lie
Cover for the sorrow that I'm feeling deep inside
Hit 'em with the shock when they hear I wanna die

[Chorus]
Why, oh why
I don't wanna be here, I just wanna die
Always been sad, i'll never be alright
Why, oh why
I don't wanna be here, I just wanna die
Always been sad, i'll never be alright10Embed Never Be Alright Never Be Alright Seon sad
