Three days in a row, six shots on the table
Still ready and able, wild horse no stable (Ayy)
Bad ones on a white out
Say it's
Way more than a night out (Yeah)
Too bright turn the lights down (Yeah)
Dark eyes on the ride out (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
You bathe in the moonlight
Too bad but you move right
I, I know what you do like
No shame in the zoo, like
Wild animals and they with me, we keep forgetting our history
Act cold but warm when you kiss me
Might shoot a shot, it might miss me

[Chorus]
Three days in a row, six shots on the table
Still ready and able, wild horse no stable (Ayy)
Bad ones on a white out
Say itâ€™s
Way more than a night out (Yeah)
Too bright turn the lights down(Yeah)
Dark eyes on the ride out (Yeah)

Whip taking off, 160
Been popping that disc, no frisbee
Tough feeling that drip, she get me
Glass slipper come off, no Disney (Wait)
We bathe in the moon light (Yeah)
Too bad, but we move right (Yeah)
I know what you do like, no shame in the mood like

[Chorus]
Three days in a row, six shots on the table
Still ready and able, wild horse no stable (Ayy)
Bad ones on a white out
Say it's
Way more than a night out (Yeah)
Too bright turn the lights down (Yeah)
Dark eyes on the ride out (Yeah)
Three days in a row, six shots on the table
Still ready and able, wild horse no stable (Ayy)
Bad ones on a white out
Say it's
Way more than a night out (Yeah)
Too bright turn the lights down (Yeah)
Dark eyes on the ride out (Yeah)Embed Wild Horse Long Days Away EP Darci soul
