On this God-forsaken planet
Smoke and death in the opal mines
Nuclear war-torn cities fill your sight
Oh, it's a world of sadistic killers
Men are tortured as they die

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Is there a savior
Who can turn the tide?

[Chorus]
All our lives are on the line
We need a hero, hero
Unknown avenger from afar
He's the chosen one
The savior of the people, hero
From sorrow's land our bleeding hearts
Cry out for a hero

[Verse 2]
In the heat of revolution
Blood runs everywhere
For a brighter future's sake
We dream and dare
It is the hour of retribution
End of dark despair

All our lives are on the line
We need a hero, hero
The seven scars and fists of fury
He's the chosen one
The savior of the people, hero
From sorrow's land our bleeding hearts
Cry out
