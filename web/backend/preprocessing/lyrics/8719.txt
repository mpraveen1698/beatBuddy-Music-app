1 ContributorRegret Lyrics[Verse]
Drownin in all my regrets
All just the same in the end
Over and over again
Drownin in all my regrets
Over and over again
All that we do is pretend
Funny at the end of the day
Drownin myself in regrets
Regrets and regrets and regrets
Over and over again
All just the same in the end
Regrets and regrets
At the end of the day
The pain that we do
To prеtend that
This was all true at
The еnd of the day
It was all pretend
Drownin in all my regrets
All just the same in the end
Over and over again
Drownin in all my regrets
Over and over again
All that we do is pretend
Funny at the end of the day
Drownin myself in regrets
Regrets and regrets and regrets
Over and over again
All just the same in the end
Regrets and regrets
At the end of the day
The pain that we do
To pretend that
This was all true at
The end of the day
It was all pretendYou might also likeEmbed In The End In The End Regnør piano
