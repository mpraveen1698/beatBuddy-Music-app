9 ContributorsHabits Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I eat my dinner in my bathtub
Then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
And it doesn't make me nervous
If anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money
Dazed and kinda lonely

[Chorus]
Well you're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind
Po po po po, po po po po
Oh high, all the time, to keep you off my mind
Po po po po po po po po po dey
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you, babe
But I fall back down
I gotta stay high, all my life
To forget I'm missing you

I pick up daddies at the playground
That's how I spend my days now
Loosen up their frown, make them feel alive
Make it fast and make it greasy
I know I'm way too easy

[Chorus]
But you're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time, to keep you off my mind
Po po po po po po po po po po
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind
Po po po po po po po po
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you, babe
But I fall back down
I gotta stay high, all my life
To forget I'm missing you

[Bridge]
Oh, staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end, woah hoo hoo
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain, ooh po po da
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end, oh yeah yeah
No I can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
[Chorus]
Oh you're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time, to keep you off my mind
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh high, all the time, to keep you off my mind
Oh po po po po po po
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you, babe
But I fall back down
I gotta stay high, all the time
To forget I'm missing you
Gotta stay high, all the time
To forget I'm missing you
