You are a stranger
And she wonders why, I
I don't trust nobody
Not even her
You are a stranger
And she wonders why, I
I don't trust nobody (That boy DJ)
Not even her,ayy

[Verse 1: Astrus*]
Been lied to to, what else?
Been cheated on, who else?
Got somebody, but want some' else
Love everyone, but don't love yourself
Tell me why everybody plays you?
Want "I love you"'s, not "Can I come through?"'s
Everybody just tryna get a piece
But then, they get it, and then, just leave
She's sick and tired of all of these games
Focus on you instead of these lames
Got hurt so much, now she can't trust
Tell you been on me just for lust
She wonders why she ain't good enough
Wonders why it's always fake love
Wonders why they all just left
But then forgets with that smoke in her chest, likeâ€”

You are a stranger
And she wonders why, I
I don't trust nobody
Not even her

And she wonders why, I
I don't trust nobody (Yo)
Not even her

[Verse 2 : Astrus*]
Look, see, I fell in love fast, fell out of it quicker
Used to be "us", now you ain't in the picture
She wonders why I can't open up
'Cause the last girl I had left and took my trust
The feel of her lips still stuck on my brain
Miss the way she used to throw that thang
Now, I'm stuck with bitches and bottles
Used to FaceTime, then she turned to my model
Like, damn, maybe I need someone
Maybe everyone just needs someone
Sick and tired not being someone
Man, I'm over here tryna find someone, like, damn
Why the fuck I'm in my feelings?
Everyday, I'm running from this healing
Everyday, I'm fucking chasing these bitches
Everyday, I'm fucking chasing these riches
[Chorus: Astrus* & Shiloh Dynasty & Shiloh Dynasty]
You are a stranger
And she wonders why, I
I don't trust nobody
Not even her
You are a stranger
And she wonders why, I
I don't trust nobody
Not even her, her17Embed She Wonders Why She Wonders Why Astrus* chill
