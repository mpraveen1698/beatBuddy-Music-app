I wish I was a flame dancing in a candle
Lighting up your living room, high on a mantle
I could bring some romance without any scandal
And then when you were done, you'd just put me out

[Verse 2]
I wish I was a tune you sang in your kitchen
Putting your groceries away and washing your dishes
I could float around your tongue and ease the tension
And then when you were done, you'd just quiet down

[Chorus]
But if I get too close
Will the magic fade?
Would I turn you off or away?
If I pull you in
Would I push you out
Of something here you care about?
I'm at a loss for what to do
I'm drawn to you

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a sweater wrapped around your hips
And when it got too cold, into me you'd slip
And when the sun came back, you would hang me up
And I would watch you while you undress

But if I get too close
Will the magic fade?
Would I turn you off or away?
If I pull you in
Now would I push you out
Of something here you care about?
Well I'm at a loss for what to do
But I'm drawn to you

[Outro]
I'm not a song
I'm not a sweater
I'm not a fire
I'm something better
I'm a man in love writing you a letter
Will you take it?
Will you keep it?
Will you read it?
Believe it
I love you
I'm sorryEmbed I Wish I Was True Sadness The Avett Brothers bluegrass
