1 ContributorGive It to Me Lyrics[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
See us in the club, we'll be
See us in the club, we’ll be
See us in the club, we'll be
See us in the club, we'll be
If you see us in the club, we’ll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

[Post-Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
(Ah)
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

[Drop: Nelly Furtado]
(Ah)
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
(Ah)

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
(See us in the club, we'll be)
(See us in the club, we'll be)
(See us in the club, we'll be)
If you see us in the club, we’ll be actin’ real nice

Oh... (Damn, improve)
