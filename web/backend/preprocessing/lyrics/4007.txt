25 ContributorsBreath Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see nothing in your eyes
And the more I see, the less I like
Is it over yet?
In my head
I know nothing of your kind
And I won't reveal your evil mind
Is it over yet?
I can't win

[Pre-Chorus]
So, sacrifice yourself
And let me have what's left
I know that I can find
The fire in your eyes
I'm going all the way
Get away, please

[Chorus]
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You got to fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you

[Verse 2]
This will be all over soon (This will all be over soon)
Pour the salt into the open wound
Is it over yet?
Let me in

You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You got to fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you

[Bridge]
(Take, take, take)
I'm waiting
I'm praying
Realize
Start hating

[Chorus]
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You got to fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you27Embed Breath Phobia (Clean Version) Breaking Benjamin metal
