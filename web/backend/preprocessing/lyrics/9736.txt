I think I need therapy
Or just some more whiskey
I can't seem to understand
How you do this to me
You've been runnin' in circles
Inside my head
Wasn't lookin' for love, but baby
I found you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Therapy, therapy, the-the-therapy
I need your therapy, therapy, the-the-therapy

[Chorus]
I didn't know I was a casualty
Until you stopped my heart and you made me see
I need your therapy, therapy, the-the-therapy
I need your therapy, therapy, the-the-therapy

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I think I need to confess
Saw you in the red dress
I can't seem to understand
How you got all that finesse
Still been runnin' in circles
Inside my head
Wasn't lookin' for love, but baby
I found you instead

But when you're gone, can't find no remedy
I need your therapy, therapy, the-the-therapy
I need your therapy, therapy, the-the-therapy
