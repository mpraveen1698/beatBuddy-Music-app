6 ContributorsEcho Lyrics[Intro]
Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo, echo

[Verse 1]
Promised you would never leave me
Oh, how I hold on to those words
Since you've been gone it isn't easy
And late at night it's getting worse

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories, hard to erase
Everywhere I see your face, your face
It's a blessing and a curse
I wanna see you, but it hurts
It hurts

[Chorus]
Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo
Bring mе back so
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherеver I go
I can hear your echo, echo, echo, echo

Bring me back so
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo, echo
Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo
Bring me back so
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo, echo, echo, echo

[Verse 2]
They say that nothing lasts forever
But they don't really tell you why
Just one more chance to do it over
I wish we had a bit more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories, hard to erase
Everywhere I see your face, your face
It's a blessing and a curse
I wanna see you, but it hurts
It hurts

I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo
Bring me back so
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo, echo, echo, echo

[Chorus]
Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo
Bring me back so
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo, echo
Let go
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo
Bring me back so
I don't wanna let go
'Cause wherever I go
I can hear your echo, echo
