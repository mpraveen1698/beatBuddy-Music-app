27 ContributorsSmile Lyrics[Intro: Sophie Meyers & Frank Sinatra]
Da da da, da da, da da da, da
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo

I really need you with me, it's so lonely in this city
If you never knew what you wanted
How could you know just
What you're missing
What you're missing
What you're missing
Missing

Within -- my heart, I know I will

[Verse: Ben Beal]
I just spent all my money on some shit I didn't need
Watch me swallow my insanity with bottles of 'legri'
Yeah, I'm walking through the city but it's feeling like a ghost town
Yeah, I'm dreaming that you're with me, but you're gone I'm so alone now
Hating this situation, I'm too tired of facing the feeling I'm craving
This life is amazing, but something is missing, and don't call me crazy but I feel like living way up in the stars
If I believe hard, I can make it
I'm trying to take a spaceship, this delay is fucking reigning
I'm wandering alone to places that I've never been
I'm putting my mind in the sky, letting the whole world in
My personality is ninety-two or ninety-three
Let's get lost up in the past, why don't you spend this day with me
You couldn't pay me to be lazy on this perfect day with you
Thinking of a payment plan is gold standard substitute
Got a blunter so in love with you
Coping with his drugs to pose
Life'll keep on living
We're just waiting for the summer, tchuuh
He wouldn't know what you're missing
Left with no one's permission
Writing rhymes in your kitchen while you're changing your clothes
I'm turning smiles to frowns
Now nobody's around
So here's a song with some more shitty thoughts of you
You might also like[Outro: Sophie Meyers & Frank Sinatra]
I'll be thinking of you
While I stare up at the sky
Darling, you're my favorite
Reason to cry
I'll never love again, I'm so in love with you9Embed Smile Smile Nohidea;Ben Beal;sophie meiers chill
