16 ContributorsTerritory LyricsWe've waited for this day
We shed some tears of love now
Like a desert in the rain
When some of the dead are waking up, mmmh yeah
There's nobody like my mom
There's no place like my home since I was born
When I was young
The flavour is so strong
I've missed it so long
Yeah

These people are my heroes
From death to the sky
They light me up your flying clouds
They ever get me high like a good blunt smoke
I'm shining like the moon
I'm feeling like a bloom under bright sun
I remember when I was young
The flavour is so strong
I've missed it so long
