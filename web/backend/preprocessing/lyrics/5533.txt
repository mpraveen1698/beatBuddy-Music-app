2 ContributorsLeft Back - Remix Lyrics[Sample :]
I'll keep you safe in theese arms of mine
Hold onto me please baby baby
I'll keep you safe in theese arms of mine
Hold onto me please (baby baby)

[Chorus: ]
Listen
Yo
Watch out for them people that violate you
But cover it up as a joke
My dad told me dont ever be a bully defend your girl and achieve your goals
I took that shot boy i hit that post (bla braa)
But be careful after that rebound im doing up music and know everyone knows
(everyone knows)

[Verse 1]
Everyone sees
Nowadays man i live too comfy
Does she lovе me
She dont love mе
One thing i do is put no one above me (No way)
Ronzo man i get that respect
Jump in a bump underneath that wep
Two jump-ups i look like a vet
Bro got a 9 cal talk about tech
How are you lame? boy your freinds are dead (ha)
But dont take it personal
Bro in a full cart back and then put it up front sat lil ursel
Dont be afriad to cut them ties
I done did that numerous times
Bro let a beat like hogwar, how are these kids tryna cover my ryhmes

Tell a friend of a friend its a temp of the leng trust me its fair trade no coco
[Ronzo]
Bro i still got chase on rostoh
Do the dash i ain't into no photo
If i get caught thats more than a chokehold
[Comfy]
They say im too gone
Looking like a new don
Never had a target on my logo
Thats estoni if you didn't clock that
If she tryna be rude man block that stop that

[Chorus]

Watch out for them people that violate you

Value your face i dont like to be seen
I ain't go no love im attatched to the queen
Still got love to the local fiend

You know they cap no snap back
Send me a snap and i bet i won't snap back
I do wear chest i dont care about backlash
Plenty of v's now you got one out man
[comfy]
I ain't made of racks yet still got bros in the dusty trap
Dont try facebump ho's like strip club my bro fell in love with the rusty wap
Maybe im involving falling in love talking feelings you must tapped (are you mad)
Are you mad? huh
Need me a couple grand if i dont get rich ima trouble the land

[Chorus]

Watch out for them people that violate you
