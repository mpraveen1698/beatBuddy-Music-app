31 ContributorsFar Behind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now maybe
I didn't mean to treat you bad
But I did it anyway
And then maybe
Some would say your life was sad
But you lived it anyway
And so maybe
Your friends, they stand around, they watch you crumble
As you falter to the ground
And then someday
Your friends, they stand beside as you were flyin'
Oh, you were flyin' oh-so high
But then someday, people look at you
For what they call their own, they watch you suffer
Yeah, they hear you calling home
And then someday, we could take our time
To brush the leaves aside so you can reach us
Hey, but you left me far behind

[Chorus]
Now maybe
I didn't mean to treat you oh-so bad
But I did it anyway
Now I'm saying, but maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer
Mm

[Verse 2]
Now maybe
I could have made my own mistakes
But I live with what I've known
And then maybe
We might share in something great
Won't you look at where we've grown
Won't you look at where we've gone
And then someday comes, tomorrow holds
A sense of what I fear for you in my mind
As you trip the final line
And that cold day when you lost control
Shame you left my life so soon, you shoulda told me
Hey, but you left me far behind

[Chorus]
Now maybe
I didn't mean to treat you oh-so bad
Oh, but I did it anyway
Now maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
Oh, but you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no, no
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Oh no
Oh no, no, no, no, no
Oh no, said oh no
Said oh no
Said oh no
But mayâ€”

[Chorus]
I said maybe
Didn't mean to treat you oh-so bad
Oh, but I did it anyway, no
Said oh no, maybe, baby
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no
I said now times have changed
Your friends, they come and watch you crumble to the ground
They watch you suffer
Yeah, they hold you down, hold on down
Said maybe love, oh, maybe love
Didn't mean to treat you bad
But you left me far behind
Left me far behind
Left me far behind16Embed Far Behind Candlebox Candlebox grunge
