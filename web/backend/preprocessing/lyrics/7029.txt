14 ContributorsDisappointment Lyrics[Chorus: Sarcastic Sounds]
I'm a disappointment
I stay up, take drugs and miss appointments
Then complain about the outcome of my choices
It feels pointless when I try to avoid
All of the thoughts in my head
Lately, I just wait on one good reason
I should even try to wake up, 'cause that shit
Feels like a motherfucking day job with no days off
I hope I get laid off to lay in my bed, my bed
You made your bed, now you lie in it

[Verse 1: Sarcastic Sounds]
And my eyes went red 'cause I'm cryin' again
Looking for love, all I find is a mess
So I break my heart for the sake of my art
Hope it makes me a star
'Cause I'm lost in the dark, I'm lost in the dark
And it's so hard to see when all damn day you're sound asleep

[Chorus: Sarcastic Sounds & Rxseboy]
I'm a disappointment
I stay up, take drugs and miss appointments
Then complain about the outcome of my choices
It feels pointless when I try to avoid
All of the thoughts in my head
Lately, I just wait on one good reason
I should even try to wake up, 'cause that shit
Feels like a motherfucking day job with no days off
I hope I get laid off to lay in my bed, my bed
What time is it? Oh my gosh, I'm late for work again

Yo, I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell
In my momma crib, kinda feeling like I'm twelve
I would throw my whole allowance in a fountain
Empty out my bank account
But with my luck, it probably wouldn't even help
Dawg, I got no job, no mic, with a girl I don't like
Nothing ever goes right, I'm tight (For real)
I told myself I'm gonna be fine almost a million times
I know that I can do whatever it takes (I got it)
But when it all crumbles and crashes, I'll be back on my ass
And I already know what I'm gonna say (Yeah)

[Chorus: Sarcastic Sounds]
I'm a disappointment
I stay up, take drugs and miss appointments
Then complain about the outcome of my choices
It feels pointless when I try to avoid
All of the thoughts in my head
Lately, I just wait on one good reason
I should even try to wake up, 'cause that shit
Feels like a motherfucking day job with no days off
I hope I get laid off to lay in my bed, my bedEmbed Disappointment (feat. Rxseboy) I'm A Disappointment Sarcastic Sounds;Rxseboy chill
