10 ContributorsLovefool Lyrics[Intro]
(Love me, love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Fool me, fool me)
(Go on and fool me)

[Verse 1]
Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know
And maybe there is nothing
That I can do to make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cry and I pray
And I beg for you to

[Chorus]
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Love me, love me
Fool me, fool me
Love me, love me
Fool me, fool me

[Verse 2]
Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake
And I wondered what I could have done
In another way to make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cry and I pray
And I beg for you to

[Chorus]
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
[Post-Chorus]
Love me, love me
Fool me, fool me
Love me, love me
Fool me, fool me

[Bridge]
Oh, I cry and I pray
And I beg for you to love me
I cry and I pray
And I beg for you to love me

[Outro]
Love me, love me
Fool me, fool me
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Love me, love me
For you to love me
Fool me, fool me
For you to love me
Love me, love me
For you to love me
Love me, love me
Say that you love me1Embed Lovefool Lovefool twocolors edm
