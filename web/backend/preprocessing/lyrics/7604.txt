7 ContributorsSpaceship Lyrics[Chorus]
Just wanna hop in my spaceship and get away from the fakeness
Your life gone be just what you make it
I swear I'm sick of the hatred
To hide the pain all these blunts I be facin’
So trapped, feel like I'm stuck in the Matrix
All these people been dyin'
Man I swear that I hate it
Let’s come together, yea it's time for some changes
So outdated and outrageous
I hope that they don't switch on me when I make it
I ain't going for it, think I'm playin'
Run up on me, stupid, gеt put down on the pavement
This thе block, load the chop, fly down sprayin'
Stick out my chest, I'm up next and they hate it

[Verse]
RIP Tray and Lil Kay yeah I’m a stand for that
I swear that I’d do anything to get my brothers back
Tusslin' with depression, you think I asked for that?
I was chosen by God, you think I asked to rap?
Still running with the same niggas cause’ they walked with me
Raisin' prices on them feature, nigga I don't talk for free
Gave her good dick then leave the scene, that's why she stalking me
I can’t believe that you gone, just hope my brother ball in peace
Everytime I hit the boof I let my soul out
I think I'm better by myself, don't need no hoes now
Fuck her good then pass the bitch down, she on my bros now
I heard Houston green the west V let's hit the road now
At first I was just playin', now my heart in all my songs now
Everybody fake and I just wanna be alone now
We came a long way from that business, so we won't fold now
No more nickel and dimin', we just tryna sit some lows out
I dream about being rich, I want the Patek on my wrist
Just runnin' up my pros, I'm never worried 'bout no bitch
I'm grindin' for this, from losin' friends, all the takin' risks
Swear you better get you bitch and her friends all on my dick
Have you ever been hurt deep inside
Smilin' up in they face, but it's the pain that you hide
I don't sit and write my raps, they just pop up in my mind
I don't listen to that music these lil' niggas be lyin'
