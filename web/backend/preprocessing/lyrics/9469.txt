I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man, I had a master plan
But I was alone

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb & Robin Gibb & Barry Gibb]
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started tremblin'
Oh, what a night it's been
And for the state I'm in
I'm still alone

[Bridge: Barry Gibb & Robin Gibb, Barry Gibb, Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb & Robin Gibb]
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone (Always end up alone)
Always end up alone

[Chorus: Robin Gibb, Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb & Robin Gibb & Barry Gibb]
So I play, I'll wait
'Cause you know that love takes time
We came so far (So far)
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't wanna be alone
You might also like[Verse 3: Barry Gibb]
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute, I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone
[Verse 4: Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb & Robin Gibb, Barry Gibb, Barry Gibb & Robin Gibb]
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
'Cause I know it isn't Heaven, is it love or hate?
Am I the subject of the pain?
Am I the stranger in the rain?
I am alone
And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told
[Chorus: Robin Gibb, Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb & Robin Gibb & Barry Gibb]
So I play, I'll wait (In time)
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far (So far)
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't wanna be alone
[Bridge: Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb & Robin Gibb]
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told
[Chorus: Robin Gibb, Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb & Robin Gibb & Barry Gibb]
So I play, I'll wait (I'll wait)
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far (So far)
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't wanna be alone
[Outro: Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb & Robin Gibb & Barry Gibb]
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruisin' on your ocean
(And I don't want to be alone)
Shine and clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
(And I don't want to be alone)
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone
(And I don't want to be alone)
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruisin' on your ocean
(And I don't want to be alone)
Shine and clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
(And I don't want to be alone)1Embed Alone Still Waters Bee Gees disco
