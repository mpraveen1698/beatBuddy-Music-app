4 ContributorsIn Case You Didn’t Know Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby I know that you've been wondering
Oh, so here goes nothing

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Verse 2]
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it, mmm
There was something bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
Oh, I'm thinking

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you

In case you didn't know

[Bridge]
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah, you're my everything

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago, mmm
