Ride, take a ride
On the Tekkno train right now
Take your seat
Open up feel the pounding bass deep inside ya
Shaky shaky sweaty sweaty
You make my spaghetti ready
Heat up the sauce it's a dinner for one

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Ratajczak]
You better hold on tight
'Cause we're rolling again
Through the wet lands down
Where the nature is plain
And when it's getting messy
I'm taking the blame
'Cause I need you to stay
On my Tekkno train

[Chorus: Nico Sallach]
There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what I want

Destination love
P-P-Pleasure up above
You really can't stop the heat
I got lipstick on my feet
Licky, licky
Sucky, sucky
Yeah you make my lolly poppy
Candy time
Go get your dinner for one

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Ratajczak]
You better go stuff your face
Before it's too late
'Cause they're standing in line
To grab a piece of the cake
And when the feast is over
We'll see us again
Next week, same time
On the Tekkno train

[Chorus: Nico Sallach]
There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what
There is a whole new world
That you need to explore
It's the sound of the rail
That you love and adore
We're riding on and on
Through the valley of love
'Cause all you got is what
All you got is what I want
