7 ContributorsNarcissist Lyrics[Verse 1]
Out of touch with my feelings
I can't help it if I'm happy or sad
Today I cried for no reason
Made me feel like a psychopath
I should hate you 'cause I love you
You should hate yourself for treating me like that
We both know you only love you
Did you know they have a name for that?

[Chorus]
You say that I'm crazy
You say that you're sorry
Won't happen again
You say I'm dramatic
I'm overreacting
And maybe I am

[Post-Chorus]
And I know
You'll get over me
But can you get over yourself?
Before you go and love somebody else
You should probably get some help

[Verse 2]
My parents don't like you
Why would they want to?
After they found me crying on the bathroom floor
I don't even like me anymore
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause you say that I'm crazy
You say that you're sorry
Won't happen again
You say I'm dramatic
I'm overreacting
And maybe I am

[Post-Chorus]
And I know
You'll get over me
But can you get over yourself?
Before you go and love somebody else
You should probably get some help

[Bridge]
You lose your voice when you yell too much
Don't say you love me until you mess up
Phone calls past 12 o'clock, wanting me back
Don't you know that they got a name for that?

[Chorus]
You say that I'm crazy
You say that you're sorry
Won't happen again
You say I'm dramatic
I'm overreacting
And maybe I am
[Post-Chorus]
And I know
You'll get over me
But can you get over yourself?
Before you go and love somebody else
You should probably get some helpEmbed Narcissist Narcissist Avery Anna country
