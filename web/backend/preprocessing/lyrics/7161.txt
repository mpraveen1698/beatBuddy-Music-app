16 ContributorsYellow Lyrics(This doesn't hurt as bad as it used to)
Love is sick
But we can try
I really like the things you do to me
The things you do to me
Love is sick
I really mean I want you close right next to me
(He talks to me)
Love is dumb
But we can try
I really like, I really like the way you stare at me
The way you stare at me
Love is yellow
I really mean I want you close to die with meYou might also like5Embed Yellow Healing Process Pity Party (Girls Club) garage
