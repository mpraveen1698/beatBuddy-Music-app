19 ContributorsStay Alive Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a rhythm in rush these days
Where the lights don't move and the colors don't fade
Leaves you empty with nothing but dreams
In a world gone shallow, in a world gone lean

[Verse 2]
Sometimes there's things a man cannot know
Gears won't turn and the leaves won't grow
There's no place to run and no gasoline
Engine won't turn and the train won't leave
Engines won't turn and the train won't leave

[Chorus]
I will stay with you tonight
Hold you close 'til the morning light
In the morning watch a new day rise
We'll do whatever just to stay alive
We'll do whatever just to stay alive

[Verse 3]
Well, the way I feel is the way I write
Nothing like the thoughts of the man who lies
There is a truth and it's on our side
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Look into the sun as the new days rise

And I will wait for you tonight
You're here forever and you're by my side
I've been waiting all my life
To feel your heart as it's keeping time
We'll do whatever just to stay alive

[Bridge]
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Look into the sun as the new days rise

[Outro]
There's a rhythm in rush these days
Where the lights don't move and the colors don't fade
Leaves you empty with nothing but dreams
In a world gone shallow, in a world gone lean
There is a truth and it's on our side
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes
Look into the sun as a new days rise18Embed Stay Alive Stay Alive (From The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty) José González songwriter
