Six months clean off the dopamine
Threw my phone through the wall
My friends can't get a hold of me
Just a dial tone when they call

[Pre-Chorus]
Chills and sweats comin' over me
And I'm aching from the withdrawal
This chemistry has got a hold of me
Got a hold of me, got a hold of me

[Chorus]
I'm a dopamine addict, can't break the habit
Runs in my head, psychosomatic
Stare in the mirror, hide in the attic
Cry in my bed, I'm a dopamine addict
And I feel like I'm out of touch
Keep thinkin' I need that crutch
Keep thinkin' I need that rush
I just can't break the habit, can't break the habit
Runs in my head, dopamine addict

[Verse 2]
I have these dreams where I'm me again
And they almost feel like they're real
It's as if I have self-esteem again
It's as if I'm starting to heal

The chills and sweats grab a hold of me
And they pull me out of my dream
They just won't seem to let go of me
To let go of me, to let go of me

[Chorus]
I'm a dopamine addict, can't break the habit
Runs in my head, psychosomatic
Stare in the mirror, hide in the attic
Cry in my bed, I'm a dopamine addict
And I feel like I'm out of touch
Keep thinkin' I need that crutch
Keep thinkin' I need that rush
I just can't break the habit, can't break the habit
Runs in my head, dopamine addict

[Bridge]
The cycle is doomed
Recycle, reuse
And then up the potency
The cycle is doomed
Recycle, reuse
It just won't let go of me
Won't let go of me, got a hold of me
[Chorus]
I'm a dopamine addict, can't break the habit
Runs in my head, psychosomatic
Stare in the mirror, hide in the attic
Cry in my bed, I'm a dopamine addict
And I feel like I'm out of touch
Keep thinkin' I need that crutch
Keep thinkin' I need that rush
I just can't break the habit, can't break the habit
Runs in my head, dopamine addict1Embed Dopamine Addict (Un)Commentary Alec Benjamin electro
