3 ContributorsIt’s Raining It’s Pouring LyricsIt's raining, it's pouring
The sleepy man is snoring
Before he went to bed he said
Can't wait to smile in the morning

It's raining, it's pouring
The lady is snoring
Before she went to bed she said
Can't wait to laugh in the morning

It's raining, it's pouring
The kitten is snoring
Before it went to bed it said
Can't wait to play in the morning

It's raining, it's pouring
The birdie is snoring
Before it went to bed it said
Can't wait to sing in the morning

It's raining, it's pouring
The sleepy man is snoring
Before he went to bed he said
Can't wait to smile in the morningYou might also likeEmbed It's Raining It's Pouring Nursery Rhymes by CoComelon Vol.2 CoComelon children
