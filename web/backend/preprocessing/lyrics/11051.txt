4 ContributorsToo High Lyrics[Chorus]
No time to stop
On my way up
Hey, doubt - sit down!
I can't quit now

I'm way too high
I'm way too high
I'm way too high
I'm way too...whoo!

No time to stop
On my way up
Hey, doubt - sit down!
I can't quit now

I'm way too high
I'm way too high
I'm way too high
I'm way too high

[Verse 1: Quinten Coblentz]
I've come all this...all this way
You're too cautious; you just play it safe
I ain't strong, but God is, and he's calling plays
The game's in the bag; I'ma take a knee like I'm Colin K, ayy
You might also likeUh, I see mega mountains
I know people count us out but we don’t ever stop
I don’t doubt they doubt us
Talking smack about us till we make it to the top

I see you huffin' and puffin', talking a lot but you bluffin'
I serve a God who makes stuff out of nothin'
We 'bout to rise, like cake in the oven, ayy

Time to go; no delay
I know it gets tough
I'ma climb anyway

Way up like a pop fly, feeling strong like I'm Popeye
Living water, I got mine
I ain't gonna drop, gonna stop; man, I'm Hawkeye
Gimme my bow; I’m cool with no spotlight, yeah

[Chorus]
No time to stop
On my way up
Hey, doubt - sit down!
I can't quit now

I'm way too high
I'm way too high
I'm way too high
I'm way too...whoo!
No time to stop
On my way up
Hey, doubt - sit down!
I can't quit now

I'm way too high
I'm way too high
I'm way too high
I'm way too high

[Verse 2: Dru Bex]
Been here for a minute, but I'm spitting like a hungry kid
Who never had a meal before
I'll say grace and eat your dinner then turn around
Raise an offering so that you could get dinner c'mon
I ain't playing with you

Y’all hot is just Tabasco; we hot like Jamaican Jerk on charcoal
We got the gospel; we came to rock souls
You buy your followers; we make disciples

Eh, got with the homie Quinten; he said, "Let's get it popping"
'Cause ain't no time for quitting, and ain't no time for stopping
We dropped a couple projects; I dropped "The Good Album"
The homie dropped “Sahara” - that was a good album
So they can stop comparing; we make our own waves
In the '18 we gonna take over both lines
Rap and pop, these other guys get road rage
Way too high we can't stick to the low lanes

[Chorus]
No time to stop
On my way up
Hey, doubt - sit down!
I can't quit now

I'm way too high
I'm way too high
I'm way too high
I'm way too...whoo!

No time to stop
On my way up
Hey, doubt - sit down!
I can't quit now

I'm way too high
I'm way too high
I'm way too high
I'm way too high

[Outro]
I'm way too high, I'm way too high
I'm way too high up1Embed No Time No Time Quintino progressive-house
