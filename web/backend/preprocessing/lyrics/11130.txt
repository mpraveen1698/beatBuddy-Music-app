You don't have to lie
I know exactly where you've been
'Cause you're chewing off my ear
While you're chewing on your chin

[Pre-Chorus]
No, we're not on the level, you're just off your face (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's not a state of mind, no, your head's just in a state (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
I may be on the outside, but you're empty within (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Don't call it a party, 'cause it never stops
Now, one is too many, but it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy, 'cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
So be careful what you wish for (So be careful what you wish for)
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Who you tryna fool?
You know you're in over your head
'Cause you're holding onto Heaven
But you're hanging by a thread
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And we're not on the level, you're just off your face
It's not a state of mind, no, your head's just in a state
I may be on the outside, but you're empty within
It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in

[Chorus]
Don't call it a party, 'cause it never stops
Now, one is too many, but it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy, 'cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
So be careful what you wish for
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
