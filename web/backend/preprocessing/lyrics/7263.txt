I come back to the places where we found us
We're somewhere in a place between love and lust

[Pre-Chorus]
And I could go anywhere, anywhere is home
Yeah I could go anywhere, never feel alone
I come back to the places where we found us, yeah

[Chorus]
When I'm not with you, I'm not me
Nothing ever feels good
When I'm not with you
I'm not in control of what I do, it's not me
When I'm not with you, I'm not me
Nothing ever feels good
When I'm not with you
I'm not in control of what I do, it's not me
When I'm not with you

When I'm not with you, it's not me
When I'm not with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I come back to the places where we found us
I come back, I come back

I'm not me, I'm not me, no
Nothing ever feels good
When I'm not with you
I'm not in control of what I do, it's not me
When I'm not with you, I'm not me
Nothing ever feels good
When I'm not with you
I'm not in control of what I do, it's not me, no no no
When I'm not with you

When I'm not with you, it's not me
When I'm not with you

When I'm not with you, I'm not me
Nothing ever feels good
When I'm not with you
I'm not in control of what I do
(I'm not in control of what I do)

When I'm not with you
When I'm not with you, it's not me
When I'm not with you13Embed Places Places Martin Solveig;Ina Wroldsen disco
