2 ContributorsYoung Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't find in me
To turn the lights off
And I know it's silly
But maybe you'll come home

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everything hurts just a little too much
I'm trying to fight but I feel like I'm stuck
In a bad dream no one's waking me up from

[Chorus]
'Cause I wish that you were still here with me
What's it like on your side of the city?
Does it hurt to know you're not here with me
'Cause I'm on my own
And do you miss all the things that we had?
I'm not sure that we'll go back to how it was
When we were young

[Verse 2]
And I hope you're happy
Even if it means
You're happy without me
And I'm hoping that you'll see
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
That еverything hurts just a little too much
I'm trying to fight but I feel like I'm stuck
In a bad drеam no one's waking me up from

[Chorus]
'Cause I wish that you were still here with me
What's it like on your side of the city?
Does it hurt to know you're not here with me
'Cause I'm on my own
And do you miss all the things that we had?
I'm not sure that we'll go back to how it was
When we were young, oh-ohh

[Bridge]
Do you remember all the late nights?
Hand in hand as we danced under street lights
Don't you miss all the things we used to do?
And, oh, now it's over, yeah, it don't feel right
But can you meet at our spot on the east side?
Maybe we should try to talk this through

[Chorus]
'Cause I wish that you were still here with me
What's it like on your side of the city?
Does it hurt to know you're not here with me
'Cause I'm on my own, ohh
Do you miss all the things that we had?
I'm not sure that we'll go back to how it was
When we were youngEmbed Young Young Keenan Te songwriter
