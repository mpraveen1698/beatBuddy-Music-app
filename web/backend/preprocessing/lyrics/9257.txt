Don't leave
Say I'm the only one you need
Say I'm the only secret you keep
Don't break me, don't break me down
Don't speak
Words only say half what you mean
I'm not the only one you see
Don't break me, don't break me now, mmm

[Verse 1]
And you know it's half past five
I've been burnin' candle light
Got me cryin' all the time
You got one foot out
Got me thinkin' where's your mind
Do you even realize
When I'm laying by your side
You got one foot out?
No, no-no-no, no, no-no-no-no-no
I'm comin' home even if I'm alone
Know that it's wrong
But I still wish you were here
Baby, come here

[Chorus]
Don't leave
Say I'm the only one you need
Say I'm the only secret you keep
Don't break me, don't break me down, ohh-oh
Don't speak
Words only say half what you mean
I'm not the only one you see
Don't break me, don't break me now, ohh-oh, ohh

I don't wanna separate
Though I know you'll never change
Promised you all I gave
Words mean too much to me
Know that only one 'gon try
Gotta work to make it right
Vows mean too much to me

[Bridge]
Your lies too sweet, stick like honey
Oh, funny honey
Catch me every, every time
Your lies too sweet, stick like honey
Oh, funny honey
Catch me every, every time

[Chorus]
Don't leave
Say I'm the only one you need
Say I'm the only secret you keep
Don't break me, don't break me down, oh-ohh, oh, ohh-oh
Don't speak
Words only say half what you mean
I'm not the only one you see
Don't break me, don't break me now
[Outro]
Don't break me down
I don't wanna lose you now
Don't break me down
I don't wanna lose you now
Don't break me down
Don't break me down
