Something's in the water and it's giving people nightmares
Seeing into Heaven, but we don't know how to get there
Chasing feelings, pacing back and forth
What are all the empty places for?
Riding a lavender line, somebody make up my mind

[Bridge]
Make up my mind
Somebody make up my mind
Make up my mind
Somebody make up my mind

[Chorus]
Something's in the water and it's giving people nightmares
Seeing into Heaven, but we don't know how to get there
Chasing feelings, pacing back and forth
What are all the empty places for?
Riding a lavender line, somebody make up my mindYou might also like1Embed Water Water BAYNK soul
