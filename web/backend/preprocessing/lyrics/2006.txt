Hey-o
Here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started man, we ain't gonna stop
We gonna turn it out 'til it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-o
Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is ya last warning, a courtesy call

When we get started man, we ain't gonna stop

[Verse 1]
I am not afraid of the storm that comes my way
When it hits, it shakes me to the core
And makes me stronger than before
It's not a question about trust
But will you stand with us?
Can you feel it?
Make it real and...

It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just writing

When it hits it'll knock you to the ground
When it shakes up everything around
But survival is a must
