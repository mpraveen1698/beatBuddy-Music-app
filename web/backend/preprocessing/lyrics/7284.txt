New-made grave
And hide me like a dead man, I've been up for days
I can't tell the difference from sleep and awake
I'm losing my patience, I can't feel my face

[Pre-Chorus]
Find me a new-made grave
And hide me like a dead man, I've been up for days
I can't tell the difference from sleep and awake
I'm losing my patience, I can't feel my face (I can't feel my)

[Chorus]
Way before you came along I was doing alright
Days I'd hold you in my arms, I would give you my life
Heartbreak, open me up, take my blood from my eyes
California, something 'bout you is haunting my mind

[Verse]
Another lonely day, reminiscing memories that you erased
I'd rather go insane than hear you telling me I'm gonna be okay
Another lonely day, reminiscing memories that you erased
I'd rather go insane than hear you telling me I'm gonna be okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Find me a new-made grave
And hide me like a dead man, I've been up for days
I can't tell the difference from sleep and awake
I'm losing my patience, I can't feel my face (I can't feel my)
