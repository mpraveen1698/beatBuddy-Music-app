15 ContributorsMorning Sex Lyrics[Verse]
Wake up and we touchin' but I can't feel
I got too many problems I put off still for the mornin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout your body
Wake up in the mornin' and to your smell
There's somethin' that I know all too well, now we yawnin'
It's early in the mornin'

[Chorus]
I know that your love, baby, is a mystery
I want you all over me
(I want you all over me)
I'll be honest baby, it ain't stoppin' me
From watching that body
From watching that body

[Verse]
Wake up and we touchin' but I can't feel
I got too many problems I put off still for the mornin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout your body
Wake up in the mornin' and to your smell
There's somethin' that I know all too well, now we yawnin'
It's early in the mornin'

[Chorus]
I know that your love, baby, is a mystery
I want you all over me
(Me-me-me)
I'll be honest baby, it ain't stoppin' me
From watching that body
From watching that bodyYou might also like7Embed Morning Sex Morning Sex Ralph Castelli indie-pop
