Stick with me, darling, I will be your man
Your company calls the best up out of me
Click with me, baby, I will lay this hand
Soft as any moss upon your feet
Staley, are you out there? I am in your lane
Catch that cup of water when it falls
Wait for me, darling, I'll be on that train
Catman had a message for us all

[Chorus]
Shout out to my lonely friends, a message that I meant to send
I got peace and love for you right now
And when I see my little sis, a middle western genius
She's got peace and love for you somehow

[Verse 2]
Gitchi Gummi sisters playing with the wind
Semi-naked flowers by my side
Gitchi Gummi sisters with your golden skin
What is in your nature we can't hide
Well, I'm a lover to all my tribes
Oh, tell me, motherfucker, can you feel my vibes?
She's a lover to dance on Earth
And now I know the meaning of what it's worth

Shout out to my lonely friends, a message that I meant to send
I got peace and love for you right now
And when I see my little sis, a middle western genius
She's got peace and love for you somehow

[Verse 3]
Drift with me, Woodson, to another side
A streak of violence be lion's pride
Sober señorita and two hundred years
A trail of happiness and tears have dried

[Chorus]
Shout out to my lonely friends, a message that I meant to send
I got peace and love for you right now
And when I see my little sis, a middle western genius
She's got peace and love for you somehow

[Outro]
Tell me something I don't know, I've got no better place to go
I've got peace and love for you right now
Surely as I jump this bus, nothing but the two of us
We've got peace and love for you somehow1Embed Peace and Love Return of the Dream Canteen Red Hot Chili Peppers metal
