8 ContributorsCome With Me Lyrics[Intro: Surfaces]
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh, ooh-oh, oh, oh, oh
I, yeah, ayy
Yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 1: Surfaces]
Another Tuesday and we sleep in 'til when it's too late
'Cause summer is whatever you say
So, I don't mind at all, at all
It's a new place if we close our eyes and paint a new way
'Cause somewhere is wherever you say
So summer turns to fall, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Surfaces]
And when the days feel like the same old circle
We'll bend the linеs and make a new world
Just to find the placе where time is free

[Chorus: Surfaces]
So, baby, come with me
As far as eyes can see
So, baby, come with me
And what is will be

[Post-Chorus: Surfaces]
What is will be
And what is will be

You take a Wednesday and you make it seem
Like it's the first day of the whole-wide week
You got that PCH type of energy, without the traffic, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
There's never bad days when a good time is whatever we say
And the sun's shinin'
So, what's your ETA? 'Cause I just can't wait to go, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: salem ilese]
And when the days feel like the same ol' circle
We'll bend the lines and make a new one
Just to find the place where time is free (Time is free)

[Chorus: Surfaces & salem ilese]
So, baby, come with me
As far as eyes can see
So, baby, come with me
And what is will be

[Post-Chorus: Surfaces & salem ilese, salem ilese]
Now what is will be, now what is
Now what is will be
And what is will be

[Outro: salem ilese]
