4 ContributorsBe Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm trustin' your trust in me
But it's feelin' heavy
The time we used to take for us
Is wasted on this
Negativity
I don't think society
Knows it's make-believe when you
When you tell me that

[Chorus]
It can get bad sometimes
Thoughts creep around like demons in your mind
But you can fall asleep with me
Fall asleep with me
And it can get bad sometimes
Lost in the woods, but you know you can find me through
The cracks of light between the trees
This is how it feels to be

[Verse 2]
You don't like these crowded streets
Wishin' anxiety
Would let you be alone with mе
Somehow
Maybe it's meant to bе
Livin' so quietly
I hope you find some peace
Inside of yourself
You might also like[Chorus]
It can get bad sometimes
Thoughts creep around like demons in your mind
But you can fall asleep with me
Fall asleep with me
And it can get bad sometimes
Lost in the woods, but you know you can find me through
The cracks of light between the trees
This is how it feels to be

[Outro]
This is how it feels to be
This is how it feels to be
This is how it feels to beEmbed Be Be Garrett Kato folk
