There was this girl
The most beautiful in the world
She had all the boys in town wrapped 'round her finger oh-oh
She would walk the halls
And everyone would whisper and talk
’Cause all the girls in town wanted to be her

[Pre-Chorus]
But behind those emerald eyes
She's a devil in disguise
The prom queen has blood on her hands
Every boy and girl she dates
Disappears without a trace
So be careful when she asks you to dance

[Chorus]
She's a motherfucking killer queen
A psychopath at seventeen
A beauty in a blood-stained dress
She’ll fill your heart with kerosene
And light you up 'til you can't breathe
If you cross her path you just might end up dead

[Verse 2]
There was this girl
Who was broken by the world
'Cause everyday at school they'd push and shove her oh-ooh
But she had a plan
One day she would get her revenge
And those cheerleaders and jocks would be six feet under (oh)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But behind those angel eyes
Lies a devilish surprise
The prom queen has killed for her crown
Every boy and girl she seeks
Never comes back in one piece
So be careful when she tries to ask you out

[Chorus]
She's a motherfucking killer queen
A psychopath at seventeen
A beauty in a blood-stained dress
She'll fill your heart with kerosene
And light you up 'til you can’t breathe
If you break her heart you just might lose your head

[Bridge]
She’s dancing by herself
She's crowned the queen of hell
Tears will sink into her skin
She’s gonna get revenge
You're all gonna know her name
She's the one and only killer queen

[Outro]
She's a motherfucking killer queen
She sold her soul at seventeen
A beautiful and broken mess
She’ll fill your heart with kerosene
And light you up 'til you can't breathe
If you break her heart you just might meet your end1Embed killer queen killer queen Mad Tsai indie-pop
