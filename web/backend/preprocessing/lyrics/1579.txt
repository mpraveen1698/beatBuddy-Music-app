Everything's been so messed up here lately
Pretty sure he don't wanna be my baby

[Refrain]
Oh, he don't love me, he don't love me
He don't love me, he don't love me, but that's okay
'Cause I love me, yeah, I love me
Yeah, I love me, yeah, I love myself anyway, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be a good, good life
That's what my therapist say
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
It's gonna be a good, good life

[Chorus]
I'm a mess, I'm a loser
I'm a hater, I'm a user
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new
I'm obsessed, I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new

He don't love me, he don't love me, but that's okay
'Cause I love me, yeah, I love me
Yeah, I love me, yeah, I love myself anyway, hey
