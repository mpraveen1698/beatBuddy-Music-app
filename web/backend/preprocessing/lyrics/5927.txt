26 ContributorsVenus Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
A goddess on a mountain top
Was burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name

[Chorus]
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
Well, I'm your Venus
I'm your fire, at your desire
Well, I'm your Venus
I'm your fire, at your desire

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Making every man mad
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no-one else had
Wow!

[Chorus]
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
Well, I'm your Venus
I'm your fire, at your desire
Well, I'm your Venus
I'm your fire, at your desire

Yeah, baby, she's got it
Well, I'm your Venus
I'm your fire, at your desire
Well, I'm your Venus
I'm your fire, at your desire8Embed Venus At Home Shocking Blue psych-rock
