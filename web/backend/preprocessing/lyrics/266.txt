Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
I could say I never dare
To think about you in that way
But, I would be lying
And I pretend I'm happy for you
When you find some dude to take home
But I won't deny that

[Pre-Chorus]
In the midst of the crowds
In the shapes, in the clouds
I don't see nobody but you
In my rose-tinted dreams
Wrinkled silk on my sheets
I don't see nobody but you

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me hooked onto something
Who could say that they saw us coming?
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

And I could say I never unzipped
Those blue Levi's inside my head
But that's far from the truth
Don't know what's come over me
It seems like yesterday when I said
“We'll be friends forever”

[Pre-Chorus]
Constellations of stars
Murals on city walls
I don't see nobody but you
You're my vice, you're my muse
You're a nineteenth floor view
I don't see nobody but you

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me hooked onto something
Who could say that they saw us coming?
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me, do you feel the love?

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me hooked onto something
Who could say that they saw us coming?
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me, do you feel the love?
[Outro]
Do you feel the love? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Do you feel the love?
Do you feel the love?
Do you feel the love?
Feel the love
Feel the love16Embed double take rapunzel dhruv pop
