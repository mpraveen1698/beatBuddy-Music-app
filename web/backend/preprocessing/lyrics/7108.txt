6 ContributorsWe Are Mirage LyricsI can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave me, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave me, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave me, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

Can you remember and humanize?
It was still where we'd energized
Lie in the sand and visualize
Like it's seventy five again

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave me, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I know everything about you
You know everything about me
Know everything about us

I know everything about you
You know everything about me
Know everything about us

I can't do well when I think

Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I can't do well when I think
