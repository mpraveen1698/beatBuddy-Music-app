You better suck it up before you suck it in
Activating motherfucking beast mode, everybody down

[Breakdown: Kevin Ratajczak]
Pump it
And if you feel like your body's given up
You gotta kill the pain and you pump it harder
And if you feel like the pain is gettin' real
Then make it your life goal to fuckin' kill that bitch
To fuckin' kill that bitch
Wake up, beast mode
Every single day I'm gonna push it fuckin' hard
And it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
I just wanna pump it2Embed Pump It Pump It Electric Callboy metalcore
