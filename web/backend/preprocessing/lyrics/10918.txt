This is our church

This is our church

To every owner of an orange heart
Know that nothing shall tear it apart
When the world will try to divide us
Then this music, will reunite us
May the heavens be praised with our sound
As we gather on holy ground
Where the doors are open wide
For the ones that have seen light

This is our church

This is our church

[Drop]

Midnight wanderers
You are not longer alone
You have found a home
Let that light shine
