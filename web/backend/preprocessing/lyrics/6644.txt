7 ContributorsNo Fun Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why do you do it every time
When all we wanna do is fly?
Oh, don't you wanna feel alive?
You're gonna have to take a side

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on, don't hold back
So come on, don't you leave
No one's controlling you
No one's controlling me
No, we don't waste no time
No, we don't need no sleep
And we can go all night
Come on

[Chorus]
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
Come on, come on
No, you're no fun

[Verse 2]
No, you don't need to run away
When everybody calls your name
So tell me what you're gonna say
And tell me that you're gonna change
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So come on, don't hold back
So come on, don't you leave
No one's controlling you
No one's controlling me
No, we don't waste no time
No, we don't need no sleep
And we can go all night
Come on

[Chorus]
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
Come on, come on
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
Come on, come on
No, you're no fun

[Outro]
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no funEmbed No Fun No Fun Armin van Buuren;The Stickmen Project progressive-house
