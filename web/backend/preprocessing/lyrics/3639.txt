33 ContributorsSweetness Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you're listening, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sing it back, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
String from your tether unwinds (String from your tether unwinds)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Up and outward to bind (Up and outward to bind)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

[Chorus]
I was spinning free, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
With a little sweet and simple numbing me

[Verse 2]
Are you listening? Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sing it back, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
So tell me, what do I need? (Tell me, what do I need?)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
When words lose their meaning (When words lose their meaning)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

[Chorus]
I was spinning free, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
With a little sweet and simple numbing me, yeah
Stumble 'til you crawl, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sinking into sweet uncertainty

[Verse 3]
If you're listening, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(If you're listening, are you listening?)
Sing it back, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
(If you're listening, are you listening?)
And I'm still running away (I'm still running away)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Won't play your hide and seek game (Your hide and seek game)
Whoa-oh (Whoa-oh), whoa-oh

[Chorus]
I was spinning free, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
With a little sweet and simple numbing me
What a dizzy dance, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
A-a-and the sweetness will not be concerned with me

[Outro]
No, the sweetness will not be concerned with me
No, the sweetness will not be concerned with me15Embed Sweetness Bleed American Jimmy Eat World power-pop
