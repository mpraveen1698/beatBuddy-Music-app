49 ContributorsLove Hurts Lyrics[Intro]
(Mmm, mmm)
(We can make it work)
Yo, Kiwi, thank you, bro
Love hurts, love hurts

[Chorus: Lil Tjay]
I know you feedin' off of what I started first
I see you postin', that just put me on alert
We can make it work, we can make it work
Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts
The way I'm feelin', I might get that nigga murked
Like how you gon' forget me? You was with me in the dirt
It might just take some time, I know that we can make it work
Baby, try it first (Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts)

[Verse 1: Lil Tjay]
You somethin' different from the rest, that's why I fuck with you
Just know it's hard for me expressin' all my love for you
Kissin' you, touchin' you, way more than me fuckin' you
Don't nobody know me like you do, you make me comfortable
I tell you everything (Everything), where I been, who I'm with, no lies to you
Fuck these other bitches, I don't wanna keep my eyes on you
Wish I could give you everything, anything, anything
Put that on my mama, all I want for you is better things
You got my number, call my phone, I ain't gon' let it ring
If I could trust you, but my style would be in better team
Girl, you know I'm with you, hundred grand, try to understand
I'm a busy man (But baby girl, I thought we had a plan)

I know you feedin' off of what I started first
I see you postin', that just put me on alert
We can make it work, we can make it work
Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts
The way I'm feelin', I might get that nigga murked
How you gon' forget me? You was with me in the dirt
It might just take some time, I know that we can make it work
Baby, try it first (Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts)

[Verse 2: Toosii]
I know that love hurt, I fuck on 'em, pull up first
That's whenever you need me
I had my best fit on, racks in them denim jeans whenever you see me
Not like your ex nigga, I be mad when you text niggas
'Cause them niggas wanna be me
And I don't fuck with none of these hoes
'Cause they rub me wrong, baby, just like a genie
I pull up in the two-door, dawg, baby, I took the roof off
And you don't even know it hurt me now that you gone
I ain't tryna be your main nigga
Thug, I'm a gravedigger
I just wish I'd known all this shit came with you
Can't help the painkillers (Painkillers)
Know I made niggas (My main niggas)
It was only right or wrong, put you in a song, thought that you was okay
Then you just left me 'lone, on my own, why won't you pick up the phone?
I know that love hurts, but you left when I had need you most
I had to see you ghost, don't need no more
Have me feelings like I can't breathe no more
I seen you postin' pictures and I unfollowed you
I couldn't see it no more
Yeah, I couldn't need no more
[Chorus: Lil Tjay]
I know you feedin' off of what I started first
I see you postin', that just put me on alert
We can make it work, we can make it work
Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts
The way I'm feelin', I might get that nigga murked
Like how you gon' forget me? You was with me in the dirt
It might just take some time, I know that we can make it work
Baby, try it first (Love hurts, love hurts, love hurts)13Embed Love Hurts (feat. Toosii) Destined 2 Win Lil Tjay;Toosii r-n-b
