I could have been a sailor, could have been a cook
A real live lover, could have been a book
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock
As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock

[Chorus 1]
I could be here and now
I would be, I should be, but how?
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first

[Verse 2]
I could have been your pillar, could have been your door
I could have stayed beside you, could have stayed for more
I could have been your statue, could have been your friend
A whole long lifetime could have been the end

[Chorus 2]
I could be yours so true
I would be, I should be, through and through
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first

[Verse 3]
I could have been a whistle, could have been a flute
A real live giver, could have been a boot
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock
As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock

[Chorus 3]
I could be, even here
I would be, I should be, so near
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first7Embed One Of These Things First Bryter Layter Nick Drake british
