25 ContributorsSleep Apnea Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pardon me, I didn’t realize what’s in your eyes
My arms are open wide
But I can't ever decide what I wanna do

[Verse 2]
I’m staring at the sky
But I can’t tell which way my thoughts are traveling
I'm trying to listen to your words
But I can’t feel my head and it’s unraveling

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I no longer know what it means
To care about the things you want to do
Everybody’s living or they're dead
And I’m still in my bed and I don’t have a clue

[Chorus]
I won’t lie and tell you it’s all right
I won’t lie and tell you it’s all rightSee Beach Fossils LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also like31Embed Sleep Apnea Clash the Truth Beach Fossils garage
