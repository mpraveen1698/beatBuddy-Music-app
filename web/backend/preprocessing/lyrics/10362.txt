No, I don't know where I'm going
But, I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

[Chorus]
And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

[Verse 2]
I'm just another heart in need of rescue
Waiting on love's sweet charity
And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days

'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

[Chorus]
And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

[Bridge]
But, here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go
Ooh, baby
Ooh, yeah

[Bridge]
And I've made up my mind
Ooh, baby, ain't wasting no more time

[Chorus]
And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

[Chorus]
And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk aloneEmbed Here I Go Again - Radio Mix Whitesnake (30th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition) Whitesnake british
