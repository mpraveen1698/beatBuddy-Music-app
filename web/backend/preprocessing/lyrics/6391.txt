I won't suffer, be broken, get tired or wasted
Surrender to nothing or will give up what I
Started and stop this, from end to beginning
A new day is coming and I am finally free

[Chorus]
Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away now, I'll attack

[Verse 2]
I would've kept you, forever, but we had to sever
It ended for both of us, faster than a
Kill off this thinking, it's starting to sink in
I'm losing control now, but without you, I can finally see

[Chorus]
Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away now, I'll attack

[Bridge]
Your promises, they look like lies
Your honesty like a back that hides a knife
I promise you, I promise you
I am finally free

Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away now, I'll attack
I will attack

[Outro]
Your promises
I promise you, I promise you11Embed Attack A Beautiful Lie Thirty Seconds To Mars grunge
