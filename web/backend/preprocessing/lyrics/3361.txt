1 ContributorMarble Lyrics[Intro: Rebecca Helena]
We're made out of marble, bulletproof steel
It's somethin' supernatural, it's almost unreal

[Verse 1: Rebecca Helena]
If I held my breath now, would you
See that I am shakin'? I'm blue
I won't lose my patience, it's true, it's true (Ah-ah)
Even in the darkness, there's light
Keep seekin' for the spark you have inside
A shot of faith will lead us home tonight, tonight (Ah-ah)

[Pre-Chorus: Rebecca Helena]
Take my hand, close your eyes
Count to ten and we'll survive

[Chorus: Rebecca Helena]
We're made out of marble, bulletproof steel
It's somethin' supernatural, it's almost unreal
We're made out of marble, bulletproof steel
It's somethin' supernatural, it's almost unreal
We're made out of marble
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na) We're made out of marble
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na) We're made out of marble
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na) We're made out of marble (Marble, marble)

If you'd close your eyes now, would you
See the place that we loved? We knew
Say that you remember it too, it too (Ah-ah)
Runnin' through the forest, me and you
Nothin' can replace what we've been through
Even in the darkness, there's a light, light (Ah-ah)

[Pre-Chorus: Rebecca Helena]
Take my hand, close your eyes
Count to ten and we'll survive

[Chorus: Rebecca Helena]
We're made out of marble, bulletproof steel
It's somethin' supernatural, it's almost unreal
We're made out of marble, bulletproof steel
It's somethin' supernatural, it's almost unreal
We're made out of marble
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na) We're made out of marble
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na) We're made out of marble
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na) We're made out of marble (Marble, marble)Embed Marble Marble Neptunica;Shockz;Rebecca Helena german
