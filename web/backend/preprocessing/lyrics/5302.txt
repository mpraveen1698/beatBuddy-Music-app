4 ContributorsBecause the Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand,i come undercover
They can’t hurt you now
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

[Chorus]
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because thе night belongs to us
Because thе night belongs to us
(Because the night)
(Because the night belongs to us)
(Because the night)

[Verse 2]
Have I doubt when I’m alone
Love is a ring, a telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our beds until the morning comes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

[Chorus]
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
