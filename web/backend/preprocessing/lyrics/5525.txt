Warm rain and thunder
Days are getting darker
A week is such a long time
Eras rot like nature
Age of paranoia
Don't be such a modern stranger
Oh angel

[Chorus]
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting

[Verse 2]
Of heaven, tongues are fencing
Too many leaves in the city
Careful like an orchid
Love survives forever
Age of paranoia
Don't be such a modern stranger
Oh angel
