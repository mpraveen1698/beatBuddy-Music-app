28 ContributorsRescue Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never been saved, but I've never come closer
Another year down and another year older
A million fresh starts, what I needed was closure, yeah
I lost who I was, but I found my composure, yeah

[Chorus]
When I found you, I found me
Nothin' around, far as I could see
You were the current that carried me
When I found you, I found me
Lines in the sand only you can read
My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me
Rescue me

[Post-Chorus]
When I found you, I found me
Lines in the sand only you can read
My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me

[Verse 2]
Call it high-strung, started uppin' my dosage
We're way too young to be feelin' this hopeless
You were my light in this endless ocean, yeah
Feelin' alive, even just for this moment, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
When I found you, I found me
Nothin' around, far as I could see
You were the current that carried me
When I found you, I found me
Lines in the sand only you can read
My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me
Rescue me

[Post-Chorus]
When I found you, I found me
Lines in the sand only you can read
My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me

[Bridge]
You got my S.O.S.O.S.​
You got my S.O.S.O.S.​

[Chorus]
When I found you, I found me
Nothin' around, far as I could see
You were the current that carried me
When I found you, I found me
Lines in the sand only you can read
My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me
Rescue me
[Post-Chorus]
When I found you, I found me
Lines in the sand only you can read
My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me
