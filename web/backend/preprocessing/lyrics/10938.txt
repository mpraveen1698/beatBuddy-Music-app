We'll never give up
Never come down
We'll never sleep
We'll gonna rave till the end of the time
We'll never give up
Never come down
We'll never sleep
We'll gonna rave till the end of the time

[Breakdown: H. P. Baxxter]
I am the captain
My name is Dave
Keep calm and behave

[Build-Up: Nessi]
We'll never give up
Never come down
We'll never sleep
We'll gonna rave till the end of the time

[Drop: H. P. Baxxter]
God save the rave
Rave till the end

[Verse: H. P. Baxxter]
We are here, we are back
Because real life lags
I'm the last man standing
On a party never ending
Harris and Ford and the screaming lord
Michael and Sim, speed it up, come on in
Take a step back for the next attack
Dress black, come and check
It's the ultimate effect
Yeah!

Never come down
We'll never sleep
We'll gonna rave till the end of the time
We'll never give up
Never come down
We'll never sleep
We'll gonna rave till the end of the time

[Build-Up: H. P. Baxxter]
We love the party and the sound
Turn it up for the crowd
From the cradle to the grave
God save the rave

[Drop: H. P. Baxxter and Nessi]
Rave till the end
We'll never give up
Never come down
We'll never sleep
We'll gonna rave till the end of the time (God save the rave)

Never come down
We'll never sleep
We'll gonna rave till the end of the timeEmbed God Save the Rave God Save the Rave Scooter;Harris & Ford happy
