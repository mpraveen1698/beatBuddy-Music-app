I'm walkin' alone, the streets are empty
The only thing I can see is my own silhouette
I'm gettin' stronger, step by step
The clock is tickin', but there's no time for regrets

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been flyin' from town to town
From London to Taiwan
I've been all around the globe
Tryin' to protect your soul

[Chorus]
We are heroes tonight
We will fly above the sky
We are heroes tonight, yeah
We are heroes tonight
We will fly above the sky
We are heroes tonight, yeah

[Drop]
Night, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' like a dynamite
Ready to explode right up in the sky
I need you to listen, I need you to hear
And don't show any fear
