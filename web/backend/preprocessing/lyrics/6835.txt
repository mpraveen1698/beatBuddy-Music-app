12 ContributorsCrying in the Rain Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride
And I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

[Verse 2]
If I wait for stormy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know
That I still love you so
Only heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

[Bridge]
Raindrops falling from heaven
Could never take away my misery
Since we're not together
I'll pray for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

[Chorus]
Some day when my crying's done
I'm going to wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But 'till then, darling, you'll
Never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
You might also like[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
Since we're not together
I'll pray for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

[Chorus]
Some day when my crying's done
I'm going to wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But 'till then, darling, you'll
Never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
