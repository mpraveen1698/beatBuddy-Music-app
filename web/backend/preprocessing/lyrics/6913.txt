The Bobby Caldwell heart shaped record, no photo
I gave it to you so you had to take a photo and send it to me
I hope you got it, look at the heart
I hope you got it, gave it to you with intentional heart
I hope you felt it, its cold outside, hearts meltin'
Soul evaporate, suddenly evaporate into a higher state
The late nights got 'em in a higher state
Walk around through business hour
Business hours be the late night, you pay a higher rate
The Bobby Caldwell heart shaped record
I'm talkin' in the tone, you don't need no compressors
Hit you with no compressor, heard the sound 5 miles away
I'm on the HP 10 miles away, lightyears ahead, a million miles away
4 walls in my head, the curvature ahead
Match me the open doors in my mind
I like the chairs to lay back and recline
Remember the caddy?
Gifted in old vibes, shit gifted in '09
I hope we made it to the new decade, its 2020
Livin' in a new decade, refurbished the heartache
You play the game until you stalemate
You stalemate, you failed mate
(you feel me? you feel me? you feel me?)
([?] you feel me? you understand? you understand? you understand?)
(you feel me?)
[Verse 2:Cities Aviv]
(yeah) regardless you gotta pay the bail mate
Pay the price-tag, pay the bail mate
No alibi, no fail-safe
You walk through quicksand, try'na do whats right
They'll throw a stone and hide your hand, do whats right
Show you face, we need the name-tag
Pay the bail mate, pay the price-tag
Before you gettin' toe-tagged
Its all leadin' up to the toe-tag
Refrigerated, I wanna be sedated
Before their soul leave their body sent into the-
Its hot
Hot se frio, I'm with my ninos, headed for the new dominio
N---as lookin' through the peephole, don't hit the front door
(knock, yeah, knock, yeah, yeah)
A lot of vultures when I'm- (ay)
Open the door leave you shocked (yeah)
Can we find a place to close the door? (uh, yeah)
A new portal to dip into and see some more than theres worth (yeah)
[?] (yeah) glamor galore (yeah)
All the allure, not of this world but this world tempt me a lot (yeah, yeah)
Just pay the bail mate, before you fail mate, no alibi or fail-safe
You talkin' 'bout guys you never met (yeah)
I'm runnin' 'round with guys you ain't never seen to do (yeah)
Seen some things you'll never see (yeah, yeah)
3 shades you try'na peek through (uh)
Problems, you scream (yeah)
I got a week full, a whole year whole, a whole ear full (yeah, yeah)
I don't really wanna hear you, get near you
Why would I be near you? why you near?
Go over there, I point my finger out at the skyline
From a vantage point to see the whole skyline
Like this is my time
Just pay the bail mate, before you fail mate
You lookin' frail mate, you really lookin' stale mate
You play the game until you stalemate, you stalemate
