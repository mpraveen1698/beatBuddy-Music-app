(Turn it up)

[Verse 1: FITZ]
Somebody save your soul
'Cause you've been sinnin' in this city, I know
Too many troubles
All these lovers got you losin' control
You're like a drug to me
A luxury, my sugar and gold
I want the good life
Every good night, you're a hot one to hold

[Refrain: FITZ]
'Cause you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap

[Verse 2: FITZ]
Somebody save your soul
'Cause you've been sinnin' in this city, I know
Too many troubles
All these lovers got you losin' control
You're like a drug to me
A luxury, my sugar and gold
I want your sex and your affection
When they're holdin' you close
You might also like[Refrain: FITZ]
'Cause you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap

[Pre-Chorus: FITZ, FITZ & Noelle Scaggs]
Every night, when the stars come out
Am I the only livin' soul around?
Need to believe you could hold me down
'Cause I'm in need of somethin' good right now
We could be screamin' 'til the sun comes out
And when we wake, we'd be the only sound
Get on my knees and say a prayer, James Brown
That I can make your hands clap

[Chorus: FITZ & Noelle Scaggs]
That I can make your hands clap
(Turn it up)
That I can make your hands clap

[Verse 3: FITZ]
My flesh is searchin' for your worst and best
Don't ever deny
I'm like a stranger, gimme danger
All your wrong and your right
Secrets on Broadway to the freeway
You're a keeper of crimes
Fear no conviction
Grapes of wrath can only sweeten your wine
[Refrain: FITZ]
But you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap

[Pre-Chorus: FITZ, FITZ & Noelle Scaggs]
Every night, when the stars come out
Am I the only livin' soul around?
Need to believe you could hold me down
'Cause I'm in need of somethin' good right now
We could be screamin' 'til the sun comes out
And when we wake, we'd be the only sound
Get on my knees and say a prayer, James Brown
That I can make your hands clap

[Chorus: FITZ & Noelle Scaggs, Noelle Scaggs]
That I can make your hands clap
That I can make your hands clap
(Yeah, oh, yeah)
That I can make your hands clap
(Yeah, oh)
So can I get a handclap?16Embed HandClap Fitz and The Tantrums Fitz and The Tantrums alternative
