Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks
Do what I wanna
Love every single part of my body
Top to the bottom
I'm not a supermodel from a magazine, mmm-mmm
I'm okay with not being perfect
'Cause that's perfect to me
'Cause that's perfect to me
'Cause that's perfect to me

[Verse 1]
No matter where I go, everybody stares at me
Not into fancy clothes, I'm rocking baggy jeans
Getting too close for comfort, but comfort is what I need
So I eat my body weight in chocolate and ice cream
Maybe I bite my nails and don't think before I speak
Don't fit in any crowd, don't ever get much sleep
I wish my legs were bigger, bigger than New York City
And I'll love who I want to love, 'cause this love is gender-free

[Chorus]
Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks
Do what I wanna
Love every single part of my body
Top to the bottom
I'm not a supermodel from a magazine (Nah)
I'm okay with not being perfect
'Cause that's perfect to me
'Cause that's perfect to me
'Cause that's perfect to me

Sometimes I wake up late and don't even brush my teeth (Ugh)
Just wanna stuff my face with leftover mac and cheese
You know I get depressed, are you impressed with my honesty?
So I wear what I wanna 'cause I'm cool with what's underneath (Mmm)
I wanna kiss someone that I'll never see again
I wanna go somewhere and go there with all my friends
I wanna take my family to go and see Eminem
'Cause my sister's been in love with him since like we were 10

[Chorus]
Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks
Do what I wanna
Love every single part of my body
Top to the bottom
I'm not a supermodel from a magazine
I'm okay with not being perfect
'Cause that's perfect to me
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na (Woo)
'Cause that's perfect to me
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na (Woo)
'Cause that's perfect to me
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na (Woo, ooh)
That's perfect to me (Haha, yeah)
