It just keeps me wonderin', this goddamn silence
It just keeps me goin' insane
Numb the pain like I was Novocaine
Numb the pain, pain
It just keeps me wonderin', this goddamn silence
It just keeps me goin' insane
Numb the pain like I was Novocaine
Numb the pain, pain
It just keeps me wonderin', this goddamn silence
It just keeps me goin' insane
Numb the pain like I was Novocaine
Numb the pain, pain
It just keeps me wonderin', this goddamn silence
It just keeps me goin' insane
Numb the pain like I was Novocaine
