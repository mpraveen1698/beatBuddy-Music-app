3 ContributorsCounting Every Blessing Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was blind, now I'm seeing in colour
I was dead, now I'm living forever
I had failed, but You were my Redeemer
I've been blessed beyond all measure

[Verse 2]
I was lost, now I'm found by the Father
I've been changed from a ruin to treasure
I've been given a hope and a future
I've been blessed beyond all measure

[Chorus]
I am counting every blessing, counting every blessing
Letting go and trusting when I cannot see
I am counting every blessing, counting every blessing
Surely every season You are good to me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh-oooh (You are good to me)
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh-oooh (You are good to me)

[Verse 3]
You were there in the valley of shadows
You were there in the depth of my sorrows
You're my strength, my hope for tomorrow
I've been blessed beyond all measure
