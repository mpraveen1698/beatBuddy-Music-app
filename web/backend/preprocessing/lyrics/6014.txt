2 ContributorsMy Beautiful Fantasy Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm reaching out but I don't get an answer
And I see without you I am anger
For eternity I saw the world crumble
For you and me my beautiful fantasy

[Bridge]
For eternity I saw the world crumble
For you and me my beautiful fantasy

[Verse 2]
Staring in the void while I know about your answer
My universe destroyed, oh break me free
For eternity I saw the world crumble
For you and me my beautiful fantasy

[Bridge]
My beautiful fantasy

[Outro]
For eternity I saw the world crumble
For you and me my beautiful fantasyYou might also likeEmbed My Beautiful Fantasy My Beautiful Fantasy Phuture Noize;B-Front hardstyle
