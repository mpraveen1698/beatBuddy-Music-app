6 ContributorsYet To Come (Hyundai Ver.) Lyrics[방탄소년단 "Yet To Come (Hyundai Ver.)" 가사]

[Verse 1: Jungkook, Jimin, V, Jin]
Was it honestly the best?
'Cause I just wanna see the next
Brighter than our yesterday
I know together
We'll make it better
Yeah, the past was honestly the best
But my best is what comes next
I'm not playin’, nah for sure
We’ll keep on fightin'
A flame ignitin'
You and I, best moment is yet to come
Moment is yet to come, yeah

[Verse 2: V, Jungkook]
다들 언제부턴가
말하네 우릴 최고라고
온통 알 수 없는 names
이젠 무겁기만 해
노래가 좋았다고
그저 달릴 뿐이라고
Promise that we'll keep on
Comin' back for more

너의 마음속 깊은 어딘가
여전한 소년이 있어
My-y-y-y moment is yet to come
Yet to comе

[Chorus: SUGA, V, j-hope, Jin, *RM,* **Jimin**]
Uh, we goin' straight to the stars
They nеver thought we'd make it this far
(Moment is yet to come, yeah)
Uh, and now the vision is clear
The goal of the century is here
(Yet to come)
*Uh, we gonna touch the sky 'fore the day we die*
**(Moment is yet to come, yeah)**
And now, we're ready to fly, the best yet to come

[Verse 3: SUGA, RM]
언젠가부터 붙은 불편한 수식어
최고란 말은 아직까지 낯간지러워
난 난 말야 걍 음악이 좋은 걸
여전히 그때와 다른 게 별로 없는걸
아마 다른 게 별로 없다면
You'll say it's all a lie, yeah
난 변화는 많았지만
변함은 없었다 해, a new chapter
매 순간이 새로운 최선
지금 난 마치 열세 살
그때의 나처럼 뱉어, huh
[Verse 4: j-hope, All, SUGA, RM]
아직도 배울 게 많고
나의 인생 채울 게 많아
그 이유를 물어본다면
내 심장이 말하잖아
We ain’t about it 이 세상의 기대
We ain’t about it 최고란 기준의 step
(We ain’t about it)
왕관과 꽃, 수많은 트로피
(We ain’t about it)
Dream & hope & goin’ forward
(We so about it)
긴긴 원을 돌아 결국 또 제자리
Back to one

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, V]
너의 마음속 깊은 어딘가
여전한 소년이 있어
My-y-y-y moment is yet to come
Yet to come

[Chorus: SUGA, Jungkook, j-hope, Jimin, *RM,* **Jin**]
Uh, we goin' straight to the stars
They never thought we'd make it this far
(Moment is yet to come, yeah)
Uh, and now the vision is clear
The goal of the century is here
(Yet to come)
*Uh, we gonna touch the sky 'fore the day we die*
**(Moment is yet to come, yeah)**
Uh, and now, we're ready to fly, the best yet to come
[Interlude: Jungkook, Jimin, RM]
(Oh) Moment is yet to come, yeah
Yet to come
(Oh-oh-oh) Moment is yet to come
(Oh-oh-oh) The best yet to come

[Outro: Jin, Jungkook, Jimin,V]
So was it honestly the best? (Best?)
'Cause I just wanna see the next
('Cause I just wanna see the next)
In the magic of the past
Memories like gold
We'll never let go
Yeah, the past was honestly the best (The Best)
But my best is what comes next
(But my best is what comes next)
We'll be singin' till the morn'
We're gonna run 'til a new tomorrow
You and I, best moment is yet to comeEmbed Yet To Come (Hyundai Ver.) Yet To Come (Hyundai Ver.) BTS k-pop
