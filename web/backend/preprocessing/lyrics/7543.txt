8 ContributorsGetting Along Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't believe you when you say, "No more"
So catch your breath when you hit the floor
Never leave you, then I'll take you back
Back and forth on a one-way track
Let the walls come down, turn the lights down low
I can't hold on and I can't let go
So believe me, I'm walking out that door
'Cause why get less when you could get more?

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' along
'Cause there ain't nothin' to it
There ain't nothin' to it, so come on
I'm gettin' along
'Cause there ain't nothin' to it
There ain't nothin' to it, yeah

[Verse 2]
You don't believe me, I don't believe you too
You let me down, I let down you
If you need me, baby, that's just fine
Get off your back and get on mine
Think I'm part of the solution, but I'm part of the pollution
Wanna really make a difference, wanna start a revolution
But believe me, I'm gonna close that door
'Cause why get less when you could get more?

I'm gettin' along
'Cause there ain't nothin' to it
There ain't nothin' to it, so come on
I'm gettin' along
'Cause there ain't nothin' to it
There ain't nothin' to it, yeah
I'm gettin' along
'Cause there ain't nothin' to it
There ain't nothin' to it, so come on
I'm gettin' along
'Cause there ain't nothin' to it
There ain't nothin' to it, yeah

[Bridge]
I stop to cross my fingers
Wish for something new
Lyin' in my sleep
And I've been double-crossin' you
Doin' out of nowhere
Wonder like a song
Just keep on movin'

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' along
'Cause there ain't nothin' to it
There ain't nothin' to it, so come on
I'm gettin' along
'Cause there ain't nothin' to it
No, there ain't nothin' to it
I'm gettin' along
'Cause there ain't nothin' to it
There ain't nothin' to it, so come on
I'm gettin' along
'Cause there ain't nothin' to it
There ain't nothin' to it, yeah
[Outro]
No, there ain't nothing to it
No, there ain't nothing to it
No, there ain't nothing to it
No, there ain't nothing to it1Embed Getting Along Weekend Man Royal Republic garage
