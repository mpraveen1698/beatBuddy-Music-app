37 ContributorsBlondie Lyrics[Verse 1]
There are flowers
In my heart
They're growing thorns
And it hurts
Every time
You're around
We break up
I feel down

[Verse 2]
And I won't
See you again
You're not a person
You're my friend
If we do
Just by chance
Can we kiss?
Can we dance?You might also like17Embed Blondie Wild Heart Current Joys indie-pop
