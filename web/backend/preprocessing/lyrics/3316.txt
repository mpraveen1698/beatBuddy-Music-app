Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and goin' out of bed
And I promise that one day I'll feel fine
And I promise that one day I'll feel alright

[Chorus]
And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
How you like it

[Verse 2]
Don't know how long I'll stay for
It's okay, I'll knock on your door
Won't you come down and get me?
I like it when you hold me tight
You make me feel nice
The green in your eyes
Makes me feel warm inside
You might also like[Chorus]
And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
How you like it

[Outro]
