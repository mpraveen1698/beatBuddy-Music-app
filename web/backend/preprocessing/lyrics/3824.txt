(I swear I'll never leave again)

[Verse 1]
Mirror on the wall, can you tell me who I am?
I think that I forgot, so remind me once again
Maybe I was going too fast
Babe, I’d give it all to go back (Yeah-ea-eah)
Baby, I'm better, I promise
Know that I've never been honest
Maybe I never forgot it (Forgot it)

[Chorus]
Daily reminder, tattoos of tigers
Cigarette lighters, laughter and cider
(Daily reminder, tattoos of tigers
Cigarette lighters, laughter and cider)

[Bridge]
Ohh (Ohh)
Ohh (Yeah)
(Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I don't deserve this, all in your arms
All your forgiveness, I don't belong
I swear, I swear I'll never leave again

Cigarette lighters, laughter and cider

So this is love?

I won’t let go
Ohh, I swear I'll never leave again3Embed i swear i'll never leave again THE REAPER keshi chill
