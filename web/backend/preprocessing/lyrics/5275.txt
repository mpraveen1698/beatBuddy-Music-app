3 ContributorsGrowing Old With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl, you stole my heart
And changed it
Took all of my plans
And rearranged them
Now I finally know what amazing grace is
When I look into your eyes
Baby, I see my whole life

[Chorus]
What you say we put us down some roots?
Find a house up on the hill
And travel 'round the world
Put some pictures on the shelf
Hold you close and keep the faith
Raise some kids with our last name
Well come on baby what you say we do?
I feel like growing old with you
Growing old with you

[Verse 2]
Every day I love you better
Than the day before
Watching sunsets fading
From the front porch
We’ll build this home togеther
Weather any storm
And as thе years keep rolling on
You'll be right where I belong
You might also like[Chorus]
What you say we put us down some roots?
Find a house up on the hill
And travel 'round the world
Put some pictures on the shelf
Hold you close and keep the faith
Raise some kids with our last name
Well come on baby what you say we do?
I feel like growing old with you
I’m growing old with you

[Chorus]
What you say we put us down some roots?
Find a house up on the hill
Travel 'round this world
Put some pictures on the shelf
Maybe one day our babies go
And have some babies of their own
And you'll get all my time 'til all my time is through
I feel like growing old with you
Growing old with you
I feel like growing old with youEmbed Growing Old With You Growing Old With You Restless Road country
