42 ContributorsEndless Nightmare Lyrics[Verse 1: Jake Hill]
I just wanna wake up and feel weightless
Most of the time I hate this
Post up all the time with a fake grin
And inside it's rainin', I
Can't seem to find the rays
Peek through the dark, see better days
I know it's comin' just don't know when
Wonderin' when I'll laugh again
And really fuckin' mean it
Straight to the depths, I've fuckin' seen it
Hell and back
That's where I been
I tell 'em that
With a pad n' pen
These days I stay low
Tell me, where's my raincoat?
Gotta face the day like usual
These demons, yeah, I'm used to 'em
Won't let 'em get used to me
Wish I was how I used to be
So carefree, so optimistic
Never took a moment to stop and listen, I
Wish for time back, I really gotta stop that
'Cause livin' in the past is so exhausting
I'm gettin' older, it's never stoppin'
Yeah, break down
Crawl in the bed, face down
Is it all in my head? Am I safe now?
Does anybody else relate? wow
So many that are just like me
But still I feel so alone at sea
The waves rush in I'm cavin' in
I just wanna fuckin' breathe

Can anybody out there hear me?
Is anybody out there near me?
I don't wanna wake up scared
I've been runnin' from this endless nightmare

[Verse 2: Josh A]
I just wanna wake up with a calm soul
Wish I could overcome my obstacles
Always feel right through the coals
Wish the world could find a common goal
But I, work through the night, and I see that
Most people don't like the feedback
Most people don't really care
And most people aren't really there
So the darkness is my solace
And the studio is my office
Try to help out all my friends
But had to learn that some just don't want it
So I, try to move on, keep it goin'
Always write new songs
Take a break and then come back strong
Only path that I've known too long yuh

[Hook: Jake Hill]
Can anybody out there hear me?
Is anybody out there near me?
I don't wanna wake up scared
I've been runnin' from this endless nightmare
Can anybody out there hear me?
Is anybody out there near me?
I don't wanna wake up scared
I've been runnin' from this endless nightmare40Embed Endless Nightmare Chaos Josh A;iamjakehill sad
