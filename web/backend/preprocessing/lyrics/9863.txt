17 Contributors6th Avenue Heartache Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sirens ring, the shots ring out
A stranger cries screams out loud
I had my world strapped against my back
I held my hands, never knew how to act

[Chorus]
And the same black line that was drawn on you
Was drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in
6th Avenue heartache

[Verse 2]
Below me was a homeless man
Singin' songs I knew complete
On the steps alone, his guitar in hand
It's fifty years, stood where he stands

[Chorus]
And the same black line that was drawn on you
Was drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in
6th Avenue heartache

[Verse 3]
Now walkin' home on those streets
The river winds move my feet
Subway steam, like silhouettes in dreams
They stood by me, just like moonbeams

And the same black line that was drawn on you
Was drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in
6th Avenue heartache
And the same black line that was drawn on you
Was drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in
6th Avenue heartache

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Look out the window, down upon that street
And gone like a midnight where was that man
But I see his six strings laid against that wall
And all his things, they all look so small
I got my fingers crossed on a shooting star
Just like me just moved on

[Chorus]
And the same black line that was drawn on you
Was drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in
