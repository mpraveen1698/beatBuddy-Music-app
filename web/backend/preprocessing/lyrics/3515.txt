Maybe I’ll never know your name
But still I’m filled with fascination
And as the platform falls away
I wonder where we’ll go

Maybe you like coffee with a cigarette
In the morning as you watch the sunrise
And hold your friends and lovers close
Silently, I wanna know

[Chorus: Sam Wills]
I don’t know who you are
But maybe we, in another life
Could fall in love, have it all
And chase our daydreams
But here we are, sat across
From one another, on an empty train
Getting lost in thought

[Verse 2: Honey Mooncie]
Maybe I’ll never know your name
Still I can picture us a thousand ways
And as you lead my mind astray
Could it mean something, or am I lost in the view?
You might also like[Chorus: Sam Wills & Honey Mooncie]
I don’t know who you are
But maybe we, in another life
Could fall in love, have it all
And chase our daydreams
But here we are, sat across
From one another, on an empty train
Getting lost in thought

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Sam Wills & Honey Mooncie]
I don’t know who you are
But maybe we, in another life
Could fall in love, have it all
And chase our daydreams
But here we are, sat across
From one another, on an empty train
Getting lost in thoughtEmbed Traingazing Breathe Sam Wills;Honey Mooncie soul
