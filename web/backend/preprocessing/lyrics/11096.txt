1 ContributorBody Funk (Edit) LyricsOne two, one two, one two
One two, one two, one two
Three, four

I don't know what I've been told
Music make you lose control
Work your body to the beat
Body work will set you free
I don't know what I've been told
Music make you lose control
Work your body to the beat
Body work will set you free

One two, one two, one two
One two, one two, one two
Three, four
One two, one two, one two
One two, one two, one two
Three, four

I don't know what I've been told
Music make you lose control
Work your body to the beat
Body work will set you free
I don't know what I've been told
Music make you lose control
Work your body to the beat
Body work will set you free
