4 ContributorsI Want You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been oversleeping so much that I've been bored of dreaming
And just wake up, not next to you
In this paper town where I live, boxes pass along and I wish
That I was sitting in one with you
With you

[Chorus]
I will be your friend, but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way, just thought I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor
Since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour, if you'll have me, I want you

[Verse 2]
You've been overthinking so much, the traffic in your head
Oh, they rush at the thought of someone new
Laurеn, why can't you accept it?
I love you and I'm not pretеnding when I say those words to you

[Chorus]
I will be your friend, but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way, just thought I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor
Since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour, if you'll have me, I want you Lo

If I learn to love myself, will it keep you from loving someone else?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
If learning to love would cost my life, I'd spend it all on you and I

[Chorus]
I will be your friend, but love you in my soul
I'll never feel another way, just thought I'd let you know
You've knocked me to the floor
Since the moment I saw you
Every minute, every hour, if you'll have me, I want youEmbed I Want You What Was, Not Now Stephen Sanchez singer-songwriter
