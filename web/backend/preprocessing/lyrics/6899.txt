3 Contributors​move Lyrics[Chorus]
Yeah we insane thinking maybe that it’s all good
Coming back around making all the shit feel good, it could
Make ya wanna move till you can’t breathe
Got me messin' in my jammies and i can’t sleep (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Stuck in a 9 to 5
Caught up but this shit’s a waste of time
Ain’t got the appetite
Tossing & turning it don’t feel right
You, me, we outta here
Take me away, in your atmosphere
Lights out I’m gone tonight
Movin' to places till I feel like

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m floating high up outer space
Feel my legs getting looser
My mind’s open to the future
This feeling I just can’t replace
Hear it burning up inside now
And I’m outta time

[Chorus]
Just move babe
Put on your shoes babe
Get on the news babe
We’re on the loose (hey)
I’m ready to move weight
Got no excuse babe
I’m over the moon babe
Ain’t nothing to lose (hey)
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Yeah we insane thinking maybe that it’s all good (hey)
Coming back around making all the shit feel good, it could (hey)
Make ya wanna move till you can’t breathe (hey)
Got me messin' in my jammies and i can’t sleep

[Verse 2]
Take you to paradise
Gotta be movin' just dont think twice
No time to compromise
Looking for reasons to feel alive
Two three, hundred degrees
We on a mission to disappear
Remember to hold on tight
Sit back relax and enjoy the ride

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m floating high up outer space
Feel my legs getting looser
My mind’s open to the future
This feeling I just can’t replace
Hear it burning up inside now
And I’m outta time

[Chorus]
Just move babe
Put on your shoes babe
Get on the news babe
We’re on the loose (hey)
I’m ready to move weight
Got no excuse babe
I’m over the moon babe
Ain’t nothing to lose (hey)
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah we insane thinking maybe that it’s all good (hey)
Coming back around making all the shit feel good, it could (hey)
Make ya wanna move till you can’t breathe (hey)
Got me messin' in my jammies and i can’t sleepEmbed move move brb. chill
