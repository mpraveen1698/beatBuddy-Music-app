5 ContributorsCamel By Camel (Mix Vocal) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sitting by the palm trees in the last oasis
Visions into my fantasy full of mystery
Dune after dune in the ocean of yellow sand
Wind is blowing silently in the Sahara land

[Pre-Chorus]
Camel by camel
Camel by camel

[Chorus]
I've tried not to remember no memories
I'm lookin' for a new dimension, new life to live
(Camel by camel) Mysterious places, perfect harmony
(Camel by camel) The desert route is changin' my destiny

[Verse 2]
I can fly all over a golden, dеsert sea
I feel good in my lonelinеss, just keepin' me
Colors and perfumes in a crazy romance
The caravans movin' easily in the camel dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Camel by camel
Camel by camel
Camel by camel
Camel by camel
