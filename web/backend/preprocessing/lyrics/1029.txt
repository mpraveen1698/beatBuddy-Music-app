51 ContributorsFirst Date Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the car, I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous, so I really can't eat

[Chorus]
Let's go, don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever

[Verse 2]
When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss
You might also like[Chorus]
Let's go, don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Let's go, don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever31Embed First Date Take Off Your Pants And Jacket blink-182 punk
