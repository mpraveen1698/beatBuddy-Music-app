2 ContributorsNever Let You Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somebody once told me
"Don't let your heart break now"
I should've listened then
Right now, it kills me to think about you
I wish that I didn't care
I tried my very best, but I can't seem to forget
Didn't know it would be this hard 'cause I know
I miss you now and I wish that you were still here, here

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you think that there is possibility?
That we go back, pretend that we're just meeting
'Cause I think maybe we should try to figure it out
So, can we start over now?

[Chorus]
I wish I didn't love you, it'd be easier
I wish you didn't turn around and say that you werе done
I wish I knew what I know now
'Cause if I had known, I would nеver let you go

[Verse 2]
It's killing me to leave but it'll hurt to stay
That's what you said when you threw it all away
I know I wasn’t perfect but I was trying, oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Do you think that there is possibility?
That we go back, pretend that we're just meeting
'Cause I think maybe we should try to figure it out
So, can we start over now?

[Chorus]
I wish I didn't love you, it'd be easier
I wish you didn’t turn around and say that you were done
I wish I knew what I know now
'Cause if I had known, I would never let you go
I wish that I could take back everything that I said
I wish that I could forget about you in my head
I wish I knew what I know now
'Cause if I had known, I would never let you go

[Bridge]
Never let you go
Never let you go

[Chorus]
I wish I didn't love you, it'd be easier
I wish you didn’t turn around and say that you were done
I wish I knew what I know now
'Cause if I had known, I would never let you go
[Outro]
Never let you go
Should’ve never let you goEmbed Never Let You Go Never Let You Go Keenan Te songwriter
