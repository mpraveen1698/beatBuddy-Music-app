Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?

[Verse 1]
It's hard for me to demonstrate
That I might work, wanna stay up late
Club girls call, want a serenade
So I hop, hop on just to feel the need
Lie, there ain't no lie
I'm just a man and I'll always want you

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard for me to love you like I do
When I'm always on the road
Baby, you should know
It's hard for me to love you just to prove
I ain't jealous, let me go
Yeah, oh, oh, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you baby?
Would I lie to you baby?

[Verse 2]
Back of the car, you start to jump on me
Like heaven, you are, just finally know me
And I, I fell in love again
And I, ain't looking for a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard for me to love you like I do
When I'm always on the road
Baby, you should know
It's hard for me to love you just to prove
I ain't jealous, let me go
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you baby?
Would I lie to you baby?
Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you baby?
Would I lie to you baby?
Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you baby?
Would I lie to you baby?2Embed Look Into My Eyes Look Into My Eyes Brando deep-house
