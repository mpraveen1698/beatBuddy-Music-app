2 ContributorsOne Friend Lyrics[Chorus]
I love it when she do her thing
Make me wanna throw some bands out these Mira Jeans
Damn, I love the way she dance when she with her team
Every time she throw that ass, it's a movie scene
All night tryna party like it's nothing
She talkin' like she with the shits
I'm like, 'What's up then"
I'm kinda lit, but I'm good enough to function
Might be down to have a threesome with your one friend (Woah)

[Verse 1]
The way she spins around that pole make me wonder
'Cause she hot like a sauna, I want to put it on her
She like new Madonna mixed with lit Rihanna
How she mix that Fashion Nova with Balenciaga (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taste just like champagne with a sip of Fanta (Ooh)
If you don't throw no money, she not lit around ya (Ooh)
She don't rock it if it's not expensive product
She fuck with Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada
That way she do her thing

[Chorus]
The way she do her thing
Make me wanna throw some bands out these Mira Jeans
Damn, I love the way she dance when she with her team
Every time she throw that ass, it's a movie scene
All night tyna party like it's nothing
Actin' like you got it, "Girl, what's up then"
I'm kinda lit, but i'm good enough to function
Might be down to have a threesome with your one friend (Ahh)
You might also like[Verse 2]
Don't be flexin', if we talkin' sex then it's never a question
You and your best friend, I'm down to explore
Do things we ain't done before
I'ma have her saying, "Ooh"

[Pre-Chorus]
She taste just like champagne with a sip of Fanta (Ooh)
If you don't throw no money, she not lit around ya (Ooh)
She won't rock it if it's not expensive product
She fuck with Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada

[Chorus]
That way she do her thing
Make me wanna throw some bands out these Mira Jeans
Damn, I love the way she dance when she with her team
Every time she throw that ass, it's a movie scene (Ooh)Embed One Friend Into the Night Elliott Trent chill
