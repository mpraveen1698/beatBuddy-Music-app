3 ContributorsThis Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Honestly
It's kinda been a couple crazy years for me
Letting go of things that were a part of me
It just didn't seem fair, wasn't going anywhere so

[Pre-Chorus]
I did all the things, I couldn't get away
But thinking of love, it had me so afraid
I needed time alone, I needed time to crawl
I needed time to find my way, so

[Chorus]
This time I'm gon' give it everything
And this time I know I'm gon' do it so damn better
This time I promise that I'm gon' give her
All that I can
'Cause I know she'll be worth a diamond ring
And I'll do what it takes to keep this thing together
After all this time you turned me into
A better man

[Verse 2]
I'm doing better now
All for my emotions to come back around
I feel like I can finally let my guard down
I'm finally going somewhere
Learning how to take things slow

I did all the things, I couldn't get away
And I'm thinking of love but girl I ain't afraid
I had my time alone, I had my time to crawl
I had my time to find my way, so, ooh

[Chorus]
This time I'm gon' give it everything (This time I'm gon' give her everything)
And this time I know I'm gon' do it so damn better
This time I promise that I'm gon' give her (I know I'm gon' give her)
All that I can
'Cause I know she'll be worth a diamond ring (And I know she'll be worth a diamond ring)
And I'll do what it takes to keep this thing together (Keep it together)
After all this time you turned me into
A better man

[Outro]
I don't know, who she gon' be
But all I know is she gon' get the best of meEmbed This Time This Time Jeff Bernat chill
