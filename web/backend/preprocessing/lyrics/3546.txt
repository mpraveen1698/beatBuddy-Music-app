38 ContributorsLonely Lyrics[Chorus]
So sick and tired of being alone
So long, farewell, I'm on my own
I'm sorry, Mom, I've got to go
I dug this grave I call my home

[Verse 1]
My life don't mean that much to me
So I'm living for you, yeah, I'm living for you
And you can't stand the sight of me
So what's the point of this fucked up catastrophe?
I'm waiting for my time to start
As I waste it, as I waste it
I pop these pills to waste some time
As I'm fadin', as I'm fadin'

[Pre-Chorus]
This shit messes with my head
The only home I know is my bed
Too lazy for a suicide
I just watch the days pass
Hoping to die

[Chorus]
So sick and tired of being alone
So long, farewell, I'm on my own
I'm sorry, Mom, I've got to go
I dug this grave I call my home
So sick and tired of being alone
So long, farewell, I'm on my own
I'm sorry, Mom, I've got to go
I dug this grave I call my home

Daydreaming of my funeral
Like who would show, bet no one would go
Hey, Dad, would you show up for me now?
Just to bury your little boy in the ground
You broke my heart when you left me
Was just waiting, was just waiting
I pop these pills to waste some time
As I'm fadin', as I'm fadin'

[Pre-Chorus]
This shit messes with my head
The only home I know is my bed
Too lazy for a suicide
I just watch the days pass
Hoping to die

[Chorus]
So sick and tired of being alone
So long, farewell, I'm on my own
I'm sorry, Mom, I've got to go
I dug this grave I call my home
So sick and tired of being alone
So long, farewell, I'm on my own
I'm sorry, Mom, I've got to go
I dug this grave I call my home
I dug this grave I call my home
I dug this grave26Embed Lonely The Bastards Palaye Royale alt-rock
