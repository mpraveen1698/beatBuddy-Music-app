9 ContributorsOne More Time Lyrics[Intro]
Do it one more time
Do it one more time

[Verse]
When the lights are low
And we're going home
Just you and I, you and I
I know I'll be fine
As long as you are here tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know that
If you go down, I go down, pick you up again
Call on me now, you know how, let me be your friend
If you go down, I go down, lift you up again

[Chorus]
Do it one more time, we'll be fine
Baby, you and I, we'll just try
Do it one more time, get it right
Baby, you and I
We do it one more time
We do it one more time
Do it one more time
