1 Contributor”not ä soul” Lyrics[Intro]

I pull up inside of a coupe
No fake is around me, I am immune
These fuck niggas oughta damn knew
I’m next on this wave better enjoy this cruise
Done endured all the pain, yes I been bruised
I relish the hate, don’t believe in a truce
Call me an emperor, she liking my groove
They gone member my name, always speaking the truth

[Chorus]

How ya gonna want a better me
But you can’t better you
Not a soul that can mess with me
Cause they playing peekaboo
Music bring out the best in me
Just wait for my debut
This shit really my destiny
Tell me who oughtta knew

[Verse]

Pink mink like Doffy
I’m a heavenly demon not jokin’
Twin choppers called Tony and Tony
Hit my shots you won’t catch me choking
Ever since I been growing
Bitches all in my hair
Lucky charms, colourful clothing
Boy I step with some flair
Comin up boy I was scarred
Now I can’t shop for my girls at Pandora (Pandor)
Can’t break a promise, a man of my word
Punchlines I’m spittin’, punch in and record
Niggas is beefin’ I’m bringing the herd
240 on Kobe, steak you can't afford
You might also like[Bridge]

Backyard so big, it look like a jungle
So I park my jag cause it might need a muzzle
Bank card so heavy, I need me some muscle
I got in the gym , gotta work hard and hustle
Africa’s greatest, no humble opinion
Soul stones on my neck, only I saw the Vision
I’m gone keep winning, stay humble go get it
We not the same, not cut from the same linen

[Chorus]

How ya gonna want a better me
But you can’t better you
Not a soul that can mess with me
Cause they playing peekaboo
Music bring out the best in me
Just wait for my debut
This shit really my destiny
Tell me who oughtta knewEmbed Hairat Anjaana Anjaani Lucky Ali pop-film
