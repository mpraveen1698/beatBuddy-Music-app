With the wind blowing in your face and the world below
Free falling back to earth like leaves of gold
When you're reaching out for love and it's getting cold
Free falling back to earth like flakes of snow

[Chorus]
Oh, I will be your parachute
I'll always cover you
And we'll rise above the darkest skies
I know you'll guide us through
When of all the things we've fallen for
I'd rather fly with you
Oh, I will be your parachute
I'll always, I'll always cover you

[Verse 2]
So we thought that you would jump to see what I would do
Free falling back to earth, I'll follow you
See you walking down the path of me, I never knew
Ascend to beautiful life of all that's true

[Chorus]
Oh, I will be your parachute
I'll always cover you
And we'll rise above the darkest skies
I know you'll guide us through
When of all the things we've fallen for
I'd rather fly with you
Oh, I will be your parachute
I'll always, I'll always cover you

I'll always cover you1Embed Parachute Parachute Paul Kalkbrenner minimal-techno
