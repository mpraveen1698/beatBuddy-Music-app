4 ContributorsPyro Lyrics[Chorus]
Boys in a bomb fight
Some of them alight
Sight in the cover
My satellite gonna see the army, army
We protect me brother
Tactical calibrate and see from every colour
Run with the rude boy
Guard the barrier [?]
Ambush them with the fire
And the bass the noise better pull, we turnt up
If we catch ya zoomin’ faster, we'll again catch up
Us in the Army I’m in the army, army
Sight in the cover
My satellite gonna see
Us in The Army I’m in the army, army
If we catch ya zoomin' faster, we’ll again catch up
Us in The Army I’m in the army, army
Us in The army I’m in the army, army
If we catch ya zoomin' faster, we’ll again catch up

Boys in a bomb fight
Some of them alight

My satellite gonna see the army, army
We protect me brother
Tactical calibrate and see from every colour
Run with the rude boy
Guard the barrier [?]
Ambush them with the fire
And the bass the noise better pull, we turnt up
Boys in a bomb fight
Some of them alight

We protect me brother
Run with the rude boy
Guard the barrier [?]
Ambush them with the fire
And the bass the noise, bass the noise, bass the noise
Us in the Army I’m in the army, army
Sight in the cover
My satellite gonna see the
Us in The Army I’m in the army, army
If we catch ya zoomin' faster, we’ll again catch up
Us in The Army I’m in the army, army
Us in The army I’m in the army, army
If we catch ya zoomin' faster, we’ll again catch up
