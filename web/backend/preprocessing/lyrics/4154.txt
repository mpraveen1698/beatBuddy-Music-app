46 ContributorsDrive Lyrics[Verse 1]
Who's gonna tell you when it's too late?
Who's gonna tell you things aren't so great?

[Chorus]
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong, but now
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna pick you up when you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up when you call?
Who's gonna pay attention to your dreams?
Yeah, who's gonna plug their ears when you scream?

[Chorus]
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong, but now
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

[Verse 3]
Who's gonna hold you down when you shake?
Who's gonna come around when you break?

[Chorus]
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong, but now
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?
Oh, you know you can't go on thinking nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?You might also like15Embed Drive Heartbeat City The Cars hard-rock
