[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home?
I'd read it every day

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
It's not right...

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants
Then why's there so much pain?
You might also like[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
It's not right...

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
It's not right...
It's not right...
It's not right...
It's not right...
