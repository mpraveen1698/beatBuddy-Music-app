It's like I’m stuck in a loop (It's like I'm stuck in a loop)
I swear I want something new (I swear I want something new)
But everything that I do (But everything that I do)
Just brings me right back to you (Just brings me right back to you)
(Just brings me right back)

[Verse 1]
I swear I’m really done this time
Can't take another stupid fight
Can't take another sleepless night where you stay out till 4 A.M
And never tell me where you been
'Cause you like you fuckin' with my head
So I'm walking away, but I know I'll be back again

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it only takes one thing
It only takes one drink at a party
It only takes onе call for me to believе that you’re sorry

[Chorus]
It’s like I'm stuck in a loop
I swear I want something new
But everything that I do
Just brings me right back to you
It’s like I'm stuck in a loop

[Verse 2]
Stop
I tell me self I'm gonna stop
Giving you everything I've got
Don't know how you control my thoughts, even when I'm alone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it only takes one thing
It only takes one drink at a party
It only takes one call for me to believe that you're sorry

[Chorus]
