Watching the video that you sent me
The one where you're showering with wet hair dripping
You know that I'm obsessed with your body
But it's the way you smile that does it for me

[Chorus]
It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

[Verse 2]
Watching the video where you're lying
In your red lingerie ten times nightly
You know I think your skin's the perfect color
But it's always your eyes that pull me under

[Chorus]
It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

[Bridge]
And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you
