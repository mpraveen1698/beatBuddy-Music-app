2 ContributorsDirty Little Secret Lyrics[Intro: Zack Knight & Nora Fatehi]
(Hold up)
Girl I ain't looking for no drama
Don't wanna take you home to mama (Yeah girl)
Just wanna keep it one-on-one, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Hold up)
I wanna get your body on me (Yeah girl)
And make you think of all them bad dreams
I heard you like it like Madonna
Come and let me set you free

[Pre-Chorus: Zack Knight]
'Cause you could be my dirty little secret
Be my dirty dealer
Baby til' you fall asleep
'Cause I could put your body on the ceiling
You don't need a reason
Call me till it's after three

[Chorus: Zack Knight]
'Cause I could make you never wanna lеave (Oi)
Bring you to your knees (Oi)
Come and live your fantasy
'Causе I could be your dirty little secret
Be my dirty dealer
You could put the X on me, X on me

Boy I know you wanna get a taste (Wanna taste)
I know u wanna see me levitate (Levitate)
But when you come around don't make me wait (Brrt)
You heard it's sweeter than a lemonade (Lemonade)
Boy I don't wanna be your one and only
'Cause all they wanna do is try to own me
But you the one I'm calling when I'm lonely, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You said you never had it like this with dem other gyal
That's why you wanna keep the business to the minimal
Could never be my inta habibi, if you wanna get with me

'Cause when I see that big back, body on TikTok
Call me 'round the clock, there will be no hesitation
Don't wanna misguide ya', always on time girl
We don't need a label, we don't need no altercation
So hit me on my line, so I can be of service
I don't wanna lie girl, it's better when you're nervous
Don't wanna make you mine but I wanna make a promise
That if you wanna that ecstasy
