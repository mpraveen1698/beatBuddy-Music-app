8 ContributorsViolin Lyrics[Verse 1: Cookiee Kawaii]
Pre-show wit’ a bag filled of pre-rolls
No fear in a crowd full of freak hoes
Feelin' brave as I walk to the stage
And I tell 'em to behave as I put 'em in a daze
I been broke and been bad
Bitch mad when I give her man whiplash
I can talk your bae into quick cash
Sexy walk my way to a big bag
I hit the bank and I cash out
Same way I hit the booth, finna lash out
No, I ain’t had fear for the past year
Go to work from the first to the last year
Do a lil' lap dance on a black man
Let him eat it from the backside, wit' a back hand
From the side, lookin' at it wit' his eyes wide
Now, anytime I feel it at the right timе

[Chorus: Cookiee Kawaii]
Go to work (Work), go to work (Work)
Go to work (Work), go to work (Work)
Go to work (Work), go to work (Work)
Go to work (Work), go to work (Work)

[Post-Chorus: Cookiee Kawaii & Dear Silas]
Put him in a daze, put him in a daze (Uh)
Put him, put him in a daze (Yo)
Bitch mad whеn I give her man whiplash
B-B-Bitch mad when I give her man whiplash

Dear Silas, uh
Big bag when I walked in
I been makin' plays, nigga top ten
I’m feelin' like Sisqó on the thong song
When I vibed out to the violin
Yo, you better work that
Gone on, bust a nigga down, make it jerk back
Said I told my dentist
“I’m relentless, I’ve been flossin’ front to side to back”
Flossin', flossin'
These niggas mad when I walk in
I’m saucin', saucin'
Drip on the rug and the carpets
Say, love, drop it down and bend it low
I wanna see how far you make it go
And if you're gonna sexy walk, please
Don’t forget to stick it out and bend your toe (Ah)

[Bridge: Cookiee Kawaii]
Sexy walk my way to a big bag (Sexy walk my way to a big bag)
Sexy walk my way to a big bag (Sexy walk my way to a big bag)

[Outro: Cookiee Kawaii]
Go to work (Work), go to work (Work)
Go to work (Work), go to work (Work)
Go to work (Work), go to work (Work)
Go to work (Work), go to work (Work)
Go to work (Work), go to work (Work)
Go to work (Work), go to work (Work)
Go to work (Work), go to work (Work)
Go to work (Work), go to work (Work)1Embed Violin Vanice Cookiee Kawaii;Dear Silas alternative
