6 ContributorsSave Me Lyrics[Chorus:]
You caused the rain, I brought you pain
But you're the only one that could save me
You caused the rain, I brought you pain
But you're the only one that could save me
Oh save me, please save me
You caused the rain, I brought you pain
But you're the only one that could save me
Oh save me

[Verse: 1]
Sometimes I hit you with a dial tone
You're right but then I say you're wrong
Sometimes I drink too much caffeine
Or go to sleep like I'm dope on morphine

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a light, there's a light in your window
There's a light, there's a light in your window
There's a light, there's a light in your window
There's a light, there's a light in your window

[Chorus:]
You caused the rain, I brought you pain
But you're the only one that could save me
You caused the rain, I brought you pain
But you're the only one that could save me
Oh save me

Sometimes I leave you come along
Sometimes there's skeletons in my bones
And that I drink way too much
Come home I'll hit you with the sucker punch

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a light, there's a light in your window
There's a light, there's a light in your window
There's a light, there's a light in your window
There's a light, there's a light in your window

[Chorus:]
You caused the rain, I brought you pain
But you're the only one that could save me
You caused the rain, I brought you pain
But you're the only one that could save me
