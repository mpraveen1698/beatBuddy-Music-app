2 ContributorsJust Say Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm guessing that I'm your type
Maybe you could come by
We can do whatever you like
Oh, boy, promise that I won't cry
I know that I seem shy
But you'll never have it like mine

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh) Don't be afraid, no
(Ooh-ooh) I'm not that fragile
(Ooh-ooh) Got what you need, though
Just say you want me, don't let me go

[Chorus]
It don't matter what you do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do
It don't matter what you do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do
You're kinda toxic, but it only makes me wanna love you
It don't matter what you—, it don't matter what you do

[Verse 2]
Oh, I like it when we slow kiss
After we get undressed
You can trace my silhouette
Oh, my therapy goes all night
I know that this ain't right
I just wanna stay in your head
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh) Don't be afraid, no
(Ooh-ooh) I'm not that fragile
(Ooh-ooh) Got what you need, though
Just say you want me, don't let me go (Just say)

[Chorus]
Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do
It don't matter what you do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do
You're kinda toxic, but it only makes me wanna love you
It don't matter what you—, it don't matter what you do

[Bridge]
(Just say)
Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do

[Chorus]
You're kinda toxic, but it only makes me wanna love you
It don't matter what you do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do
You're kinda toxic, but it only makes me wanna love you
It don't matter what you—, it don't matter what you do

[Outro]
Just say you want me, don't let me go (Just say)Embed Just Say Just Say Coco & Breezy;Tara Carosielli soul
