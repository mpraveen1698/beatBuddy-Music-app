53 ContributorsThe Last Stand Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the heart of the Holy See
In the home of Christianity
The seat of power is in danger
There's a foe of a thousand swords
They've been abandoned by their lords
Their fall from grace will pave their path, to damnation

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the 189
In the service of Heaven
They're protecting the holy line
It was 1527, gave their lives on the steps to Heaven
Thy will be done!

[Chorus]
For the grace, for the might of our Lord
For the home of the holy
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Gave their lives so boldly
For the grace, for the might of our Lord
In the name of His glory
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Come and tell their story again

Under guard of 42
Along a secret avenue
Castel Sant'Angelo is waiting
They're the guards of the Holy See
They're the guards of Christianity
Their path to history is paved with salvation

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the 189
In the service of Heaven
They're protecting the holy line
It was 1527, gave their lives on the steps to Heaven
Thy will be done!

[Chorus]
For the grace, for the might of our Lord
For the home of the holy
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Gave their lives so boldly

For the grace, for the might of our Lord
In the name of His glory
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Come and tell their story again
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Dying for salvation with dedication
No capitulation, annihilation
Papal commendation, reincarnation
Heaven is your destination

Dying for salvation with dedication
No capitulation, annihilation
Papal commendation, reincarnation
Heaven is your destination

In the name of God

[Chorus]
For the grace, for the might of our Lord
For the home of the holy
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Gave their lives so boldly

[Outro]
For the grace, for the might of our Lord
In the name of His glory
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Come and tell their story
Gave their lives so boldly
Come and tell the Swiss Guards' story again17Embed The Last Stand The Last Stand Sabaton swedish
