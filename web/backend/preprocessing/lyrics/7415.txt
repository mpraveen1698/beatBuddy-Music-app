15 ContributorsSAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY Lyrics[Intro: Moliy]
Dollars all around
Oh there's dollars all around
Dolla, dolla, bills, yeah
Dolla, dolla, bills
You're on my frequency
You've been staring at me, since you walked in the bar
I don't really know how long though

[Verse 1: Moliy]
I don't need no fake love
No, I don't need no favor
I know my time will come
Just me and my maker (Da, da, da, da-la)
I'm gonna make the paper (Da, da, da, da-la)
I'm gonna make the paper (Da, da, da, da-la)
I'm gonna make the dollar bills (Da, da, da, da-la)
I'm gonna get paid, yeah

[Chorus: Moliy]
Get the fuck outta my way
I'm gonna get paid, yeah
I wanna get paid, yeah
Just give me my mula-la-la-la
Get the fuck outta my way
I'm gonna get paid, yeah
I'm gonna get paid, yeah
Just give me my mula-la-la-la

I really like to party
I really like to party
I really like to party
I cannot control my body
So when this song is starting
Just cancel all your plans, oh
It's evident in my dancing
Moonwalk like Michael Jackson

[Verse 2: Moliy]
To the left (Left), to the right (Right)
To the front with it go, yeah, yeah
To the left (Left), to the right (Right)
To the front with it go, yeah, yeah
I already know just how it goes
I already know just how it goes
For the night, I'm riding solo
Don't want no odo just leave me alone
I've been waiting, oh, all night long
For the DJ to play my song
I dey whine and grind on your booboo
Somebody please don't call on the po-po
Turn it up and then drop it low-low
All this lockdown it done make me ko-lo
I been waiting, oh, all night long, oh
Tonight I no go pick my phone
'Cause I'm so gone, oh

Just give me my mula-la-la-la (Da, da, da, da-la)

[Post-Chorus: Moliy]
I really like to party
I really like to party
I really like to party
I cannot control my body
So when this song is starting
Just cancel all your plans oh
It's evident in my dancing
Moonwalk like Michael Jackson

[Verse 3: Amaarae]
I feel nice, there's nothing in my way (My way)
Shawty wanna fuck but I just want my space (My space)
In a lambo truck, I'm racing
Rims still spinnin', I'm pacing
I don't wanna talk, I'm dancing, dancing
Straight to the bank, count Benji to Frank, walk out like I'm that bitch
Put the braids back, movin' like Kelz
Bad hoes in the back, singin' "That's that shit"
Yeah, I really do talk like I walk
Uh, I really been about that life
Uh, shawty askin' me for advice and I told lil' baby "All I got is the spice for ya"
[Refrain: Moliy]
Get the fuck outta my way
I'm gonna get paid, yeah
I wanna get paid, yeah

[Outro: Amaarae]
Two time knockin', ten man down
You say you the king, where the crown at nigga?
I've been muggin' since the first day
And you couldn't see a nigga on my worst day, no
Put Moliy on the record for the flex, I was feeling kinda reckless
Young lil mama's a finesser (Mmm)3Embed SAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY THE ANGEL YOU DON'T KNOW Amaarae;Moliy alternative
