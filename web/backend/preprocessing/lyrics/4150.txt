8 Contributors​chances Lyrics[Verse 1: thuy]
Don't say
I didn't always let you get your way
(Get your way, get your way, get your way)
Don't stay
Looking back, I should have let you slip away (Slip away, baby)
I keep pushing forward then get pulled back to you
Yeah, frontin', sayin' I don't want you back, but I do (But I do)
You've been stuck in old ways, but this ain't nothin' new
Kept my heart open, now it's closin' on you (Closin' on you)
You keep me up at night
I wonder if you're mine
We runnin' out of time
"Sorry" don't make it right (Ohh)
I wish I read the signs
You ain't one of a kind
Don't worry, I'll be fine, I'll be fine

[Chorus: thuy]
I ain't no hit it and quit it
'Cause once I'm wit' it, I'm in it
Not afraid to admit it
I'm feeling you
But once you got it, you ghost it
Then came right back like you own it
This ain't right and you know it
I'm feeling used
I gave you one too many chances
One too many, ooh-whoa-whoa
I gave you onе too many chances
One too many (One too many)

It's еverything you do that keep me thinking 'bout you ('Bout you)
Stuck on you since the first time my eyes saw you
(My eyes saw you)
I can admit it I did things I'm not proud of, no
But I hope, wherever you're at, you think of me too
You should've never had to question (Question)
Baby our hearts connected
Promise I learned my lesson
You say you gave me so many chances
My actions didn't meet your standards
It took you leaving me to get the message, yeah
Thought I'd be straight, but I'm still here stuck on you (You)
Ayy, might be somewhere plottin' on me girl but it's cool (Whoa)
Might be somewhere thinkin' 'bout me
And I hope it's true (It's true)
'Cause you still my one (The one)
You know it too

[Chorus: thuy & DCMBR]
I ain't no hit it and quit it
'Cause once I'm wit' it, I'm in it (Yeah)
Not afraid to admit it
I'm feeling you (Feelin' you)
But once you got it, you ghost it
Then came right back like you own it
This ain't right and you know it
I'm feeling used
I gave you one too many chances (Chances)
One too many, ooh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
I gave you one too many chances (Chances)
