Follow me like the North Star
Do you really want a rockstar?
Time wasted, I’m wasted
Ooh – follow me like the North Star

[Verse 1]
Mackned
She look like Weezy, Miss Officer
Ass so fat, look like a costume
Ooh, and I know it cost you
Hands all on your waist
Like a dance in ‘92

[Verse 2]
Mackned, ooh la la
She want me, I want you
She ratchet, and I like it
Once I break it, I’m gon' buy it
She told me smash it
Coochie was an island

[Chorus]
Follow me like the North Star
Do you really want a rockstar?
Time wasted, I’m wasted
Ooh – follow me like the North Star
You might also like[Bridge]
Mackned, ooh la la
She want me, I want you
She ratchet, and I like it
Once I break it, I’m gon' buy it
She told me smash it
Coochie was an island

[Outro]
Follow me like the North Star
Ooh – follow me like the North StarEmbed North Star God Mom Mackned emo
