8 Contributors​One Little Favor Lyrics[Verse 1]
We’ve been dating for a year and a half now
It’s time I spoke about the way that I feel
And yes, I think about the future we’ll have but
How can I be certain your love for me is real?
Girl, I’m ready to commit, to get closer
I’m dropping hints, I’ve got the question rehearsed
There’s one little thing I’ve got to get over
Just one little favor you’ve got to do me first
If you let me, baby, you can start the countdown
All you’ve gotta do for me, my darling is follow me on SoundCloud
Follow me on
Yeah, follow me on

[Verse 2]
It’s been weeks since when I first popped the question
Pulled the ring out and then spoke from the heart
You were sobbing and I don’t think that you heard me
I don’t think that you realized my proposal had two parts
Now we’re walking hand in hand to the altar
I’ve gotta tell you, you look perfect in that dress
And yes, I love you babe, in sickness and in health but
Before I say “I do” to you, I’ve got one last request
I’m so happy, babe, to have you as my spouse now
But first, before our vows, you’ve gotta vow to me
You’ll follow me on SoundCloud
Follow me on SoundCloud
Follow me on
[Verse 3]
So we did it, took the plunge into wedlock
You were waiting till’ the both of us got married
Let’s get consummating, I could make your bed rock
But first, just pull your phone out, girl, before I pop your cherry
And if you let me baby, I could bring the house down
Yes, I’ll take you to pound town
But in the name of love, amor
I’ve got a shameless plug before I plug you
Follow me on SoundCloud
Follow me on SoundCloud
Follow me

[Verse 4]
Don’t act like you’re blameless
Like you’re beyond my reproach
How much fucking work does it take to make a single playlist (It's not hard)
or throw me a repost? (No, It's not hard at all)
I still remember when I fell for you,
Your smile resembled that of Aphrodite’s, I wished I could call you mine forever
Now we’re man and wife and we’ve made vows and walked the aisle
I’d never thought that me and you would be here, soon to raise a child together
I know this is special, we’ve put in nine months of time and effort
So before your water breaks I’ve just got one last final question,
All I need’s your SoundCloud information, you can type the letters
Babe, I know you’re close just hold your labour off till I press enter
See that orange button, there’s no need to be reluctant
All you’ve gotta do is click the mouse down
It would mean so much to me, my baby
If you followed me on SoundCloud (Like, really!)
Followed me on (I-it's a - it's a click!)
Followed me on SoundCloud (I've been asking you for like - It's a click, it's a fucking click!)1Embed I Loved You Then (And I Love You Still) I Loved You Then Woodlock folk
