25 ContributorsA Soulmate Who Wasn’t Meant to Be Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never should have called
'Cause I knew you'd leave me
But I didn't think you could do it so easily
And I never should have held your hand
On that cold rainy night
'Cause, further along, it would cause another fight

[Chorus]
Stranger, that's all I see
When I look into your eyes
A soulmate who wasn't meant to be
Stranger, who knows all my secrets
Can pull me apart and break my heart
A soulmate who wasn't meant to be

[Verse 2]
I never should have kissed
Kissed your hand
I'm under your control
I will never understand
I never should have said
"I love you"
You never said it back
So why do I still care for you?

Stranger, that's all I see
When I look into your eyes
A soulmate who wasn't meant to be
Stranger, who knows all my secrets
Can pull me apart and break my heart
A soulmate who wasn't meant to be

[Bridge]
Wish I could go back to the day we met and leave you be
Sit and look pretty
Never should have called
Never should have held
Never should have kissed
Never should have said

[Chorus]
Stranger, that's all I see
When I look into your eyes
A soulmate who wasn't meant to be
Stranger, who knows all my secrets
Can pull me apart and break my heart
A soulmate who wasn't meant to be14Embed A Soulmate Who Wasn’t Meant to Be Do You Love Me, or Are You Just Lonely? Jess Benko songwriter
