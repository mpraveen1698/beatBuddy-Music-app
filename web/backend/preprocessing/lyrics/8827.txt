4 ContributorsShadow Lyrics[Verse 1]
In a world where we're treading water
And you're aiming against the waves
When the roses have lost their colours
Yeah, I promise I'll stay the same
In a world with billions of people
Know that I only see your face
Cause a life without you is lethal
So I die just to keep you safe

[Chorus]
Wherever you go
You know I follow
Always beside you
I'll be your shadow
So if your heartbreaks
Like cracks in the pavement
Just know that I'm not far behind

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
When the days feel like empty echoes
And your back's up against the wall
All the memories that you can let go
Yeah, I'll help you replace them all
Can't control all the seasons changing
There's no way we can stop the rain
But when everything else is breaking
Got a love that will never fade
You might also like[Chorus]
Wherever you go
You know I follow
Always beside you
I'll be your shadow
So if your heartbreaks
Like cracks in the pavement
Just know that I'm not far behind

[Drop]
(I'll be your shadow)

[Outro]
Wherever you go
You know I follow
Always beside you
I'll be your shadow
So if your heartbreaks
Like cracks in the pavement
Just know that I'm not far behind1Embed Shadow Shadow Syn Cole;Alida deep-house
