31 ContributorsMessages from the Stars Lyrics[Chorus]
I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy

[Verse 1]
When I'm out there all alone
And feeling far from home
I'm fading into blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Pre-Chorus]
Then out on the sky like a flash
Sending me high, high
You rescue me
You saved me from a certain tragedy

[Chorus]
I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy

[Verse 2]
When I'm far out in the night
And searching for a light
There's darkness all around
And you're nowhere to be found
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When out on the sky like a flash
Sending me high, high, high
You rescue me
You saved me from a certain tragedy

[Chorus]
I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy
I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy
I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy
[Even longer Intermezzo]

[Chorus]
I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy
I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy
I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy4Embed Messages from the Stars Going Up The Rah Band funk
