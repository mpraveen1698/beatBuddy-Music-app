Space girl, show me the stars
You know the galaxies of my heart

[Chorus]
Girl, are you a Cancer?
'Cause you make me cry
When we kiss or dance in the sky
We're dancing in the sky

[Verse]
Space girl, I saw a lunar eclipse
Looked like how I feel 'bout your lips
Space girl, the only way that we'd end
Was if you were sucked into a black hole
But I'd still spend my days dreamin' 'bout you
Dreamin' 'bout you
Tell me how to
Stop dreamin' 'bout you

[Chorus]
Girl, are you a Cancer?
'Cause you make me cry
When we kiss or dance in the sky
(In the sky)
We're dancing in the sky
(The sky)

I hope you play this song some day
And think of Earth Girl who loves Space Girl
I hope you play this song some day
And think of Earth Girl who loves Space Girl
I hope you play this song some day19Embed space girl space girl Frances Forever indie-pop
