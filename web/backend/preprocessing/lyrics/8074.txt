33 ContributorsVelvet! Lyrics[Intro]
I think I'm James Brown
'Cause when the bitches hear this
They're gonna be like: "Wow!"
MATHIAS
Hehe, uh (Ashka!)

[Chorus]
Smoking gas, living fast, wearing velvet (Wow!)
Can you take a .45 to the pelvis? (Bow!, bow!)
Plenty money goin' 'round, I'm not selfish (Skrrt, skrrt)
And the ladies love me, Elvis (Blong!)
Smoking gas, living fast, wearing velvet (Wow!)
Can you take a .45 to the pelvis? (Wow!)
Plenty money goin' 'round, I'm not selfish (Skrrt, skrrt)
And the ladies love me, Elvis (Zoom, zoom)

[Verse]
Nasty, very, very, very fucking nasty
Comme on my body, everything about me classy
Xannies is a prolly, got me sweating like a track meet (Woo, woo)
Pop a Vicodin and then I put one in her ass cheek
She a bad bitch, how you do your dance? (Dance)
Man, these ad-libs make me several bands (No cap)
You a catfish, not like Instagram (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)
When I hit the stage, she was in a trance (Woo! Woo, woo!)
I was in a rush, therefore not tryna conversate (Yeah!)
I'm hussin' off an addy pill that I just busted quietly
And now I cut a bitch off if she ever try to find me (Yeah!)
And I will bet you top dollar, you ain't getting as high as me, or fly as me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Three grams or four grams or fives grams, or both, yeah
Tap in or tap out, my nigga, let's do some'n
MAC-10 and make your body count like fruit punch (Brrt)
Everybody is mad at me like, so what? ([?] Skrrt!)
So what? Lil' nigga, let's go (Let's go!)
Pour up what you got in the soda (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Six deep, but I came solo
Lightsabers hit you, Han Solo (Woo, woo, woo, woo!)
You might also like[Chorus]
Smoking gas, living fast, wearing velvet (Wow!)
Can you take a .45 to the pelvis? (Bow!, bow!)
Plenty money goin' 'round, I'm not selfish (Skrrt, skrrt)
And the ladies love me, Elvis (Blong!)
Smoking gas, living fast, wearing velvet (Wow!)
Can you take a .45 to the pelvis? (Wow!)
Plenty money goin' 'round, I'm not selfish (Skrrt, skrrt)
And the ladies love me, Elvis (Zoom, zoom)
