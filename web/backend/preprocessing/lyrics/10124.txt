I'm writing this in case I'm gone tomorrow
I'm writing this in case I've moved along
There's something that I hope you'll remember
That life is not a game, it's a song

[Pre-Chorus]
So take the best parts of me
Locked away without the keys
And know that I'm forever by your side

[Chorus]
When the lights go down
Know that I am never far away
When the sun burns out
I'll be waiting on the brighter side of grey

[Verse 2]
If you're reading this, I know you're feeling sorrow
If you're hearing this, I know you're probably scared
Just know that all the things you own are borrowed
And all you get to keep is all you've shared

[Pre-Chorus]
So wipe away the tears for me
Know that we've made history
Remember no one ever really dies

When the lights go down
Know that I am never far away

[Chorus]
