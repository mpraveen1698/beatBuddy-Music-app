You're my rock star, baby, got me hypnotized
See the whole world dancin' right before my eyes
You can love me, you can love me tonight
You're my rock star

[Verse 1: Mougleta]
I think I had a dream of you
Now I'm lost in this crazy mood
You made the crowds go wild
And sang a song for me all night

[Pre-Chorus: Mougleta]
There's a hole in me, hole in me here tonight
It has control over me, over me for life
Gotta go back to sleep to see your eyes
Got those cowboys roots and I miss you every time

[Chorus: Mougleta]
You're my rock star, baby, got me hypnotized
See the whole world dancin' right bеfore my eyes
You can lovе me (Love me), you can love me tonight
You're my rock star

[Verse 2: Mougleta]
Everybody came to see you play
Standin' in the middle, I can't look away
And I hear them sing our song
What a sweet times, I wish they'd go on

[Chorus: Mougleta]
You're my rock star, baby, got me hypnotized
See the whole world dancin' right before my eyes
You can love me, you can love me tonight
You're my rock star
You're my rock star, baby, got me hypnotized
See the whole world dancin' right before my eyes (Dancin', baby)
You can love me, you can love me tonight
You're my rock star
