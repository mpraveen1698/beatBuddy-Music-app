I don't practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball
Well, I had a million dollars, but I'd, I'd spend it all
If I could find that jaina and that Sancho that she's found
Well, I'd pop a cap in Sancho and I'd slap her down

[Chorus]
What I really wanna know, ah, baby, mmm

Well, it's love that I need, oh

And I'll make it, oh yes, I'm comin' up"

Ooh, what I really wanna say is, "There's just one"
Way back, and I'll make it, oh yeah I'm coming up
My soul will have to wait yeah
