A record of the delightful piece
They're going to play this evening

Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
Your attention please

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, the moment we've been waiting for is here
I- I have something to tell you

[Chorus]
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be
(Remember) Will be
(Remember) Will be

The future's not
The future's not
The future's not

I believe in the future (I believe in the future)
I don't believe in miracles
Can it be true?!
It must be true, no doubt! (no doubt!)

Life is going on as normally as ever
But suddenly something seems to have happened
(Suddenly something seems to have happened)
Everybody seems to be staring in one direction
People seem to be frightened, even terrified

I want everybody to understand this
I don't understand
I don't understand
There're a lot of things we don't understand either
(understand, either)

We need answers from you
What- What did you expect to find?
(What did you expect to find?)
What is going to be our future?
It-  It's your responsibility to do something about it!
Well, I, uh...
I have the key in my hand
All I have to find is the lock
Now listen to me, all of you!
[Chorus]
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be
(Remember!) Will be
(Remember!) Will be
