I'm another year older
I won't cry about you anymore
Told my friends to come over
To dye my hair, mmm
It's not even the weekend
And I'm wearin' that dress I can't afford
Givin' life a new meanin'
Without you there

[Pre-Chorus]
Do some stupid shit, maybe get a tattoo (Oh)
Whatever I can do to get my mind off you (Oh)

[Chorus]
It's my birthday
I'ma do what I like
I'ma eat what I like
I'ma kiss who I like
It's my birthday
I'ma do what I like
I'ma wear what I like
I'ma party tonight
Goddamn, it's my birthday
Everybody love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Look at me, give me money
Damn, it's my birthday
Everybody love me
And I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
