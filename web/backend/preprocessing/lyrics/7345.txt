8 ContributorsHands On You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can leave your wardrobe at the door
Tell me what you want and, girl, and it's yours
I, never felt nothing like this before
Gave me everything and then some more
I, used to tell my friends, "Well, that's the old me"
Keep our business lowkey, that's for my eyes only
You came over, said you had something to show me
Hopped right out the phone screen

[Chorus]
Wearin' nothing but my hands on you
No designer, just that birthday suit
When it's late at night, I see the real you
It's a movie, girl, the way that you move, move
Wearin' nothing but my hands on you, you, you, you
Wearin' nothing but my hands on you, you, you, you
Wearin' nothing but my hands on

[Verse 2]
Can't nobody else set me straight but you, nah
Can't nobody else do the things you do for me
You know I'm all in, temptation's callin', but I won't fall in
And I know that you be alright all on your lonely
Spendin' nights in limbo, off doin' your own thing
But when you hit me, say you got something to show me
Hopped right out the phone screen
You might also like[Chorus]
Wearin' nothing but my hands on you
No designer, just that birthday suit
When it's late at night, I see the real you
It's a movie, girl, the way that you move, move
Wearin' nothing but my hands on you, you, you, you
Wearin' nothing but my hands on you, you, you, you
Wearin' nothing but my hands on

[Verse 3]
I don't need nobody else, oh no
Got time to waste, and I got cash to blow
But that don't mean nothing to me at all
Got everything I need when you show up

[Chorus]
Wearin' nothing but my hands on you
No designer, just that birthday suit
When it's late at night, I see the real you
It's a movie, girl, the way that you move, move
Wearin' nothing but my hands on you, you, you, you
Wearin' nothing but my hands on you, you, you, you
Wearin' nothing but my hands on youEmbed Hands On You Hands On You Austin George sad
