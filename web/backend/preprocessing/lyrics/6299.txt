20 ContributorsInside Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take it, I don't need it (I don't need it)
I don't wanna hear your motherfuckin' side
You can love it (You can love it)
Or you can leave it (Or you can leave it)
Because nothing I say and nothing I feel is right
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't understand
While I'm sitting up here dying, you're just holding out your hand
And even if I wanted to, I couldn't have explained
'Cause you don't know the difference between violence and pain

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no denying it, you've never had control

[Chorus]
I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes, I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out

[Verse 2]
I'm not a dog (I'm not a dog), I'm not a slave (I'm not a slave)
It doesn't matter how much money I get paid
I give a shit (I give a shit), I never did (I never did)
So you can wipe it away, that silly fuckin' grin
If I wrote it down for you, could you ever see it clear?
Or would it go straight through your soul and come right out your ear?
If I slowed it down for you, would you think me insincere?
'Cause in the end, I'll never bend, I'll never shed a tear

There's no denying it, I've always had control

[Chorus]
I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes, I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out
(Inside out)

[Bridge]
How you've turned me inside out
Inside out
Inside out
How you've turned me inside out
I'm inside out
So inside out

[Chorus]
I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes, I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out
