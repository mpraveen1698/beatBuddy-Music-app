2 ContributorsWorld Hold On (FISHER Rework) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Alright, yeah
Open up your heart, what do you feel?
Open up your heart, what do you feel is real? Yeah
The big bang may be a million years away, oh
But I can't think of a better time to say

[Chorus]
World (World), hold on
Instead of messing with our future, open up inside
World (World), hold on (Hold on)
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky

[Post-Chorus]
Children of the sky, oh-whoa
Children of the sky

[Verse 2]
Look inside, you'll find a deeper love
The kind that only comes from high above
If you ever meet your inner child, don't cry, no, no, oh
Tell them everything is gonna be alright

[Chorus]
World (World), hold on
Instеad of messing with our future, open up insidе
World (World), hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky
World (World), hold on (Hold on)
Instead of messing with our future, tell me no more lies
World (Come on), hold on (Come on)
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky
