4 ContributorsBreathe Lyrics[Intro]
Alright, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
No brakes, no brakes
Your head and my heart in a tight race
I want you close, but you want space
Okay, okay
Pretending like everything's okay
You want to go, but can we stay?

[Pre-Chorus]
You lose all your control
When we go down this road
Overthinking about where it can go (Where it can go)

[Chorus]
Baby, don't panic
Don't lose no sleep (Oh-oh)
All these monsters in your head are bad dreams
No, no, don't panic
Count one, two, three (One, two, three)
Yeah, baby, I need you to breathe

[Drop]
Breathe
All your control
When we go down this road
Overthinking about where it can go
Breathe
All your control
When we go down this road
Overthinking about where it can go
Breathe
All your control
When we go down this road
Overthinking about where it can go
Breathe

In, out, up, down
Your lungs and your breath in a hold out
Try to relax, I need you now
Can't talk, can't speak
About what we are and what it means
Just step back and let it be

[Pre-Chorus]
You lose all your control
When we go down this road
Overthinking about where it can go (Where it can go)

[Chorus]
Baby, don't panic
Don't lose no sleep (Oh-oh)
All these monsters in your head are bad dreams
No, no, don't panic
Count one, two, three (One, two, three)
Yeah, baby, I need you to breathe

[Drop]
Breathe
All your control
When we go down this road
Overthinking about where it can go
Breathe
All your control
When we go down this road
Overthinking about where it can go
Breathe
All your control
When we go down this road
Overthinking about where it can go
Breathe
