We walk this earth
With fire in our hands
Eye for an eye
We are Nemesis

We are with you
Countless vicious souls
Fight, fighting for freedom
United we stand, we stand

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 2]
We are legion
Voice of anarchy
This is revolution
Creating new disorder

We are enemy
Opponent of the system
Crushing hypocrisy
Slaying the philistine, yeah!

[Chorus]
One for all, all for one
We are strong, we are one
One for all, all for one
We are one, Nemesis!

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 3]
A malicious fever burns
In our hearts, in our veins
Your blood, my blood
All blood runs the same, the same

[Chorus]
One for all, all for one
We are strong, we are one
One for all, all for one
We are one, Nemesis

[Breakdown]
We are Nemesis

[Chorus]
One for all, all for one
We are strong, we are one
One for all, all for one
We are one, Nemesis
