6 ContributorsAutomatic Lyrics[Verse 1: Justin Breit]
Wake up, man, I hate the front door
Tell myself, "Go out more"
End up in the same bed, lonely
Feels like every day is wasted
Like I'm on a wait list
For someone to really know me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Breit]
I, I don't know where you're from
I don't care if it's real
I, 'cause I like the way you talk
The way you feel

[Chorus: Justin Slaven]
Automatic
Shit, you feel like magic
Cinematic, and I gotta have it
Shit, you feel like magic
God, I love the way you talk
The way you feel, baby

[Post-Chorus: All]
Duh-duh-duh-dum-dum, duh-duh-dum
Duh-duh-duh-dum-dum, duh-duh-dum
Duh-duh-duh-dum-dum, duh-duh-dum
Duh-duh-duh-dum-dum, dum-dum

I've been driving with the breaks on
Taking all the turns wrong
But if it brought me here, I'm not mad
Tеll me this don't happen often
Got you ditching your friеnds
You say that you never do that

[Pre-Chorus: Jake Miller]

I (Yeah, yeah), 'Cause I like the way you talk
The way you feel

[Chorus: Jake Miller & All]
