I've been waiting all my life
I've been spending all my nights
Contemplating all my trails
Oh my God, this' not overnight
I've been giving all my soul
I've been chasing all my goals
Dedication all I know
That's how hard I go

[Pre-Chorus: Bas & Black Sherif]
Blood, sweat and my tears, no, I will not surrender
If you take my lead then we can fly together
Heaven never seem to reach, it's now or never
We got what we need but we don't got forever (Mm-mm)

[Chorus: Bas]
Oh, oh, oh-way-oh
Oh, oh, oh-way-oh
Oh, oh, oh-way-oh

Oh, oh, oh-way-oh
Oh, oh, oh-way-oh
Oh, oh, oh-way-oh

Oh, oh, oh-way-oh

Oh, oh, oh-way-oh
Oh, oh, oh-way-oh
Oh, oh, oh-way-oh
I've been waiting all my life
