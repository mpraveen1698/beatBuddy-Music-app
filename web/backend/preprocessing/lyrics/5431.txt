Losing Interest, you won't find no better than this

[Verse]
What did I tell you guys?
I said, what did I tell you?
These people are sayin' my dream isn’t real
They say that about every thing I feel
What happened to being supportive?
Some people heard my touchy songs and abhorred it
I got a passion, you know I’ll uphold it
And I’m buildin traction, yea you know that I rolled it
What you expect tho?
Yeah, what you expect?
Me at 13 didn’t do what to do
Last October’s when it all fell through
I was close to being gone
And none of y’all even noticed
Except for the few that cared
It’s for that reason that i wrote this
I’m tired of being judged
(judged judged judged)
Tired of being nudged
(nudged nudged nudged)
I know that I’ve fallen into this before, it
Kills me inside it’s a chore
I really don’t know why
That I ever tried to hide
From my fear creeping inside
Makin' me feel like I wanna cry
