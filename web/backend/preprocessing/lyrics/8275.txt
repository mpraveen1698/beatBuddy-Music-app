It started out as a feeling
Which then grew into a hope
Which then turned into a quiet thought
Which then turned into a quiet word
And then that word grew louder and louder
'Til it was a battle cry

[Chorus]
I'll come back when you call me
No need to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Just because everything's changing
Doesn't mean it's never been this way before
All you can do is try to know who your friends are
As you head off to the war
Pick a star on the dark horizon and follow the light

[Chorus]
You'll come back when it's over
No need to say goodbye
You'll come back when it's over
No need to say goodbye

[Verse 3]
Now we're back to the beginning
It's just a feeling and no one knows yet
But just because they can't feel it too
Doesn't mean that you have to forget
Let your memories grow stronger and stronger
'Til they're before your eyes
You might also like[Chorus]
You'll come back when they call you
No need to say goodbye
You'll come back when they call you
No need to say goodbye12Embed The Call The Call Regina Spektor piano
