Why's this always gotta happen to me? I should have known
I never fail to never learn from mistakes, still throwing stones
Blood-signed, we made a pact
Yours dried out, you took it back

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know you are a paradox and you contradict
The road you walk, everything that you ever did
Cutting into my code
Erasing everything I know

[Chorus]
Hear me out
I'm sorry, but I'm a little less than sold
I've been around
Heard all the stories you said you never told
You're used to speaking in tongues
To feel like you're in control
Now you've got nowhere to run
Now you'vе got nowhere to go

[Verse 2]
I feel my focus fadin' away, I had high hopes
Running from thе man that I used to be, but I'm too slow
Blood-signed, we made a pact
Yours dried out, you took it back

Hear me out
I'm sorry, but I'm a little less than sold
I've been around
Heard all the stories you said you never told
You're used to speaking in tongues
To feel like you're in control
Now you've got nowhere to run
Now you've got nowhere to go

[Bridge]
Tell me what's mine and tell me what's yours
Why I never got a say, never got a choice
Tell me what's mine and tell me what's yours
Why I never got a say, never got a choice
Tell me what's mine and tell me what's yours
Why I never got a say, never got a choice
Tell me what's mine and tell me what's yours
And why I never ever got a fucking say, oh

[Breakdown]
Are you ready?
I'm in the driver's seat now
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Hear me out
I'm sorry, but I'm a little less than sold
I've been around
Heard all the stories you said you never told
You're used to speaking in tongues
To feel like you're in control
Now you've got nowhere to run
Now you've got nowhere to go
Hear me out
I'm sorry, but I'm a little less than sold
I've been around
Heard all the stories you said you never told
You're used to speaking in tongues
To feel like you're in control
Now you've got nowhere to run
Now you've got nowhere to go1Embed Nowhere To Go THE DEATH OF PEACE OF MIND Bad Omens metalcore
