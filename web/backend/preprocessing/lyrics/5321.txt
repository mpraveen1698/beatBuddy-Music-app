5 ContributorsTonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember the times we spent together
On those drives, we had a million questions
All about our lives
And when we got to New York everything felt right
I wish you were here with me
Tonight

[Verse 2]
I remember the days we spent together
Were not enough, and it used to feel like dreaming
Except we always woke up
Never thought not having you here now
Would hurt so much

[Chorus]
Tonight I've fallen, and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you
I can just look up
And know the stars are
Holding you, holding you, holding you
Tonight

[Verse 3]
I remember the time you told me
About when you were eight
And all those things you said that night
That just couldn't wait
I remember the car you were last seen in
And the games we would play
All the times we spilled our coffees
And stayed out way too late
You might also like[Verse 4]
I remember the time you sat and told me
About your Jesus, and how not to look back
Even if no one believes us
When it hurts so bad, sometimes
Not having you here

[Chorus]
I sing
Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you
I can just look up
And know the stars are
Holding you, holding you, holding you
Tonight

[Chorus]
I sing
Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you
I can just look up
And know the stars are
Holding you, holding you, holding you
