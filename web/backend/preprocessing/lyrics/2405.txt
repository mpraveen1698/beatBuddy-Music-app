Rule number one
Is that you gotta have fun
But, baby, when you're done
You gotta be the first to run
Rule number two
Just don't get attached to
Somebody you could lose
So le-let me tell you

[Chorus]
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys, they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys, they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
'Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you

Rule number three
Wear your heart on your cheek
But never on your sleeve
Unless you want to taste defeat
Rule number four
Gotta be lookin' pure
Kiss him goodbye at the door
And leave him wanting more, more

[Chorus]
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys, they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys, they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

'Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you
[Bridge]
Girls, we do whatever it will take
'Cause girls don't want
We don't want our hearts to break in two
So it's better to be fake
Can't risk losing in love again, babe

[Chorus]
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys, they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys, they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you
