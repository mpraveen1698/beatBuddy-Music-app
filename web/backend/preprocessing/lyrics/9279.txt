I can't be your love
Look, it’s too trivial for you now
Oh, my life is fallin' apart
Maybe no one will notice if I disappear

[Chorus]
But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I’ll give you all my life, my seasons

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I can't be your love
'Cause I'm afraid I'll ruin your life
While the leaves withered away
And grew again
You have gone far away
I'll be pushing up daisies
And bring all the chances to here

[Chorus]
But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I'll give you all my life, my seasons
By your side, I’ll be your sеasons
