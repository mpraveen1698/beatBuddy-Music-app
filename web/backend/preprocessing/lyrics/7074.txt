2 Contributors​confidence in me Lyrics[Verse1]
When I look up at the mirror
All I see is, is nothing but all my flaws
Negative thoughts in the shower
Yea I can’t seem to, to accept who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause there’s so many people out there
Who don’t even need to try
To look perfect they way they are
Oh why can’t I just, be like them and
Have a little confidence in me? oh

[Chorus]
I wanna believe
But it ain’t easy
I wanna be seen
But it’s all blurry (woah)
Tell me how do I get over this
Cause I don’t wanna cry no more
I wanna believe
But it ain’t easy woah ooo woah

[Verse 2]
Still looking right up at the mirror
Thinking bout all, all the memories made
Beautiful souls all around me (all around me)
Oh I’m trying, to accept who I am
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Cause there’s so many people out there
Who don’t even need to try
To look perfect they way they are
Oh why can’t I just, be like them and
Have a little confidence in me? oh

[Chorus]
I wanna believe
But it ain’t easy
I wanna be seen
But it’s all blurry (woah)
Tell me how do I get over this
Cause I don’t wanna cry no more
I wanna believe
But it ain’t easy woah ooo woah

[Outro]
When I look up at the mirror
All I see is, is nothing but all my flaws
Negative thoughts in the shower
Yea I can’t seem to, to accept who I am4Embed confidence in me confidence in me Rangga Jones chill
