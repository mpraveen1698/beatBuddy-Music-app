It's making you cry every time
You give your love to me this way
Saying you'd wait for me to stay
I know it hurts you

[Chorus]
But I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'd change for you someday
But I can't help the way I feel
Wish I was good
Wish that I could give you my love now

[Chorus]
But I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you crySee Cigarettes After Sex LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like12Embed Cry Cry Cigarettes After Sex indie-pop
