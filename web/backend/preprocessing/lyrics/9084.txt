End of May or early June
This picture-perfect afternoon we shared
Drive the winding country road
Grab a scoop at Ã€ La Mode
And then we're there

An open field that's framed with trees
We pick a spot and shoot the breeze
Like buddies do
Quoting songs by our favorite bands
Telling jokes no one understands
Except us two
And we talk and take in the view

All we see is sky for forever
We let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day

We walk a while and talk about
The things we'll do when we get out of school
Bike the Appalachian trail or
Write a book or learn to sail
Wouldn't that be cool?

Like girls we wish would notice us but never do
He looks around and says to me
"There's nowhere else I'd rather be"
And I say, "Me too"
And we talk and take in the view
We just talk and take in the view
All we see is sky for forever
We let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way, this way
All we see is light for forever
'Cause the sun shines bright for forever
Like we'll be alright for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day

And there he goes
Racing toward the tallest tree
From far across the yellow field I hear him calling, "Follow me" There we go
Wondering how the world might look from up so high
One foot after the other
One branch then to another
I climb higher and higher
I climb 'til the entire
Sun shines on my face
And I suddenly feel the branch give way
I'm on the ground
My arm goes numb
I look around
And I see him come to get me
He's come to get me
And everything's okay
All we see is sky for forever
We let the world pass by for forever
Buddy, you and I for forever this way, this way
All we see is light
'Cause the sun burns bright
We could be alright for forever this way
Two friends
True friends
