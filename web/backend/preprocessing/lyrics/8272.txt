I could never be mad at you
Pussy remedy like a Tylenol
Remember being broke, I was eyein' you
Now I have you

[Pre-Chorus]
But keep it all a hundred, did you have faith?
When I was around, you never looked my way
This a fast life, mami, things gon' change
I was never the type to complain
I did my own thing

[Chorus]
Private, six zeros
Now it's nice to meet you
Back then when I see
You were like "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
I can't be mad with you
This a cold world, yo te digo
"Pero mami, no te necesito", no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
Porque tú no me quieres con nadie
Tú no me quieres con nadie
You don't want me with nobody, no

Now I see a different side of you
Always got problems all around you (Haha)
Even when the problem ain't about you
What's that say about you? (Crazy)
Hablando pura mierda when you wasted
You can't even hold a conversation (Nah)
Mami, I'm running out of patience (Woah)
Running out of ways for me to fake it

[Pre-Chorus]
But keep it all a hundred, did you have faith?
When I was around, you never looked my way
This a fast life, mami, things gon' change
I was never the type to complain
I did my own thing

[Chorus]
Private, six zeros
Now it's nice to meet you
Back then when I see
You were like "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
I can't be mad with you
This A cold world yo te digo
"Pero mami, no te necesito", no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[Post-Chorus]
Porque tú no me quieres con nadie
Tú no me quieres con nadie
You don't want me with nobody, no
Tú no me quieres con nadie
Tú no me quieres con nadie
You told me you're with nobody, no
