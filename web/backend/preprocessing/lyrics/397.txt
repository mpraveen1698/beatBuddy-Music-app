Tell me pretty lies, look me in the face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fucking care at all
And you been out all night, I don't know where you been
You're slurrin' all your words, not makin' any sense
But I don't fucking care at all

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
'Cause I'm so fucking scared

[Chorus]
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care at all, I don't fucking care
I don't fucking care

[Verse 2]
Would you tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me even though it's fucking fake
I don't fucking care at all, a-a-a-all
And you been out all night, I don't know where you been
You're probably gettin' fucked, you're probably givin' head
And I don't fucking care at all
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I have hella feelings for you

[Chorus]
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care at all, I don't fucking care
I don't fucking care at all

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Mmm

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm only a fool for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
But I don't fucking, I don't fucking care178Embed idfc dead blackbear pop
