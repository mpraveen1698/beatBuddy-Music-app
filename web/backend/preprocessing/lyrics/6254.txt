24 ContributorsYou & I (Nobody in the World) Lyrics[Intro]
I... Yeah

[Verse 1]
You fix your make-up, just so
Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago

[Pre-Chrous]
And if your mirror won't make it any clearer
I'll be the one to let you know

[Chrous]
Out of all the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

[Verse 2]
You stop the room when we walk in
The spotlight's on, everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their time
Stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine

And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

[Chrous]
Out of all the girls
You’re my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

[Bridge]
You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try
Oh, you don't have to try
Don't try, don't try
You don't have to try

[Chrous]
Oh, out of all of the girls
You’re my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
They don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
[Outro]
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I111Embed You & I (Nobody in the World) Love In The Future (Expanded Edition) John Legend soul
