24 ContributorsConversations in the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]
Talk, let's have conversations in the dark
World is sleeping, I'm awake with you, with you
Watch movies that we've both already seen
I ain't even looking at the screen
It's true, I got my eyes on you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say that you're not worthy
You get hung up on your flaws
Well, in my eyes, you are perfect as you are

[Chorus]
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart

[Verse 2]
On Sunday mornings we sleep in 'til noon
Oh, I could sleep forever next to you, next to you
And we, we got places we both gotta be
But there ain't nothing I would rather do
Than blow off all my plans for you

And you say that you're not worthy
And get hung up on your flaws
But in my eyes, you are perfect as you are
As you are

[Chorus]
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart

[Bridge]
When no one seems to notice
And your days, they seem so hard
My darling, you should know this
My love is everywhere you are

[Chorus]
I won't ever try to change you, change you (Yeah)
I will always want the same you, same you (Oh-oh)
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart (Yeah)
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely (Oh, when you get lonely)
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me (Yeah-yeah)
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart
[Outro]
Ooh
Ooh
I won't break your heart8Embed Conversations in the Dark Bigger Love John Legend soul
