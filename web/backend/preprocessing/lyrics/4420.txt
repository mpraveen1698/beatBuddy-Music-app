24 ContributorsCarry Me Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm such a bore, I'm such a bummer
There must be more behind the summer
I want someone to make some trouble
Been way too safe inside my bubble, oh
Take me out and keep me up all night
Let me live on the wilder side of the light

[Chorus]
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away

[Verse 2]
You carnivore, you loose cannon
Can I have some more? I can't understand it
You fast car, you foolish spender
You know you are, and I surrender
So come on over and wake me up
Put some of your tequila in my coffee cup
You know I need you, and that's for sure
You're just the kinda crazy I've been lookin' for
You might also like[Chorus]
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
(Where the sun hits my face all different)
Carry me away
Carry me away
