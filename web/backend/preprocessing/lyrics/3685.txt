12 ContributorsKrystal Lyrics[Verse 1]
Krystal is a real pro
She's a red rose
She could wreck any home
Krystal is a good host
On a talk show
She could strike any pose

[Chorus]
I forget if I ever loved anyone else
I forget if I ever loved anyone else

[Verse 2]
K's eyes are like first prize
These are hard times
But she carries on by
Dressed nice in all weather types
She will pass by
At a point in your life

[Chorus]
I forget if I ever loved anyone else
I'm a mess and I'll never love anyone else

[Chorus]
I forget if I ever loved anyone else
I'm a mess and I'll never love anyone else
I'm obsessed and I'll never love anyone else
I forget if I ever loved anyone elseYou might also like1Embed Krystal Krystal Matt Maltese folk
