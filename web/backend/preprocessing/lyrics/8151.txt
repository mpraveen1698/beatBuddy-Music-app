The way you felt in my arms, our chemistry was sacred
Oh, I fell for your charm, I was so infatuated
But you left me in the dark and my heart completely vacant
Now I don't know-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Is your heart just preconditioned for brevity?
I don't mean to accuse you of refusing longevity
But I cannot excuse you for abusing my empathy
My empathy

[Pre-Chorus]
I can take rejection
But you gave the impression
That this was the inception
Of something real

[Chorus]
The way you felt in my arms, our chemistry was sacred
Oh, I fell for your charm, I was so infatuated
But you left me in the dark and my heart completely vacant
Now I don't know-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
How you could look me in the eye and tell me that you love me
When you knew it was a lie, I was headed for Kentucky
When you called to say goodbye, how did I not see it coming?
Now I don't know-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Maybe I'm the one to blame, have a tendency
For always ignoring my brain when it says to me
That someone's been manipulating my empathy
My empathy, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
I can take rejection
But you gave the impression
That this was the inception
Of something real

[Chorus]
The way you felt in my arms, our chemistry was sacred
Oh, I fell for your charm, I was so infatuated
But you left me in the dark and my heart completely vacant
Now I don't know-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
How you could look me in the eye and tell me that you love me
When you knew it was a lie, I was headed for Kentucky
When you called to say goodbye, how did I not see it coming?
Now I don't know-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
[Chorus]
The way you felt in my arms, our chemistry was sacred
Oh, I fell for your charm, I was so infatuated
But you left me in the dark and my heart completely vacant
Now I don't know-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh16Embed The Way You Felt The Way You Felt Alec Benjamin electro
