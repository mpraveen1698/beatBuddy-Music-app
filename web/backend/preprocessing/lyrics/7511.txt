4 ContributorsReady To Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't want to waste your time
Leave you hanging in the balance
You are all I need tonight
I hope this will last forever
You are more than just a phase
Your smile brings me out the darkness
You are all I need tonight
I hope this will last forever

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm so ready, ready, ready to love
Ready, ready, ready, love
Ready, ready, ready to love
Ready, ready, love
I'm so ready, ready, ready to love
Ready, ready, ready, love
Ready, ready, ready to love

[Drop]
Ready, ready to love
Ready, ready to love

[Verse 2]
Flowers hanging in the window
Match the color of your eyes
Dancing in a ball of fire
Each move with no compromise
I can't live the same without you
Your heart makes me come alive
You bring joy through all the sadness
Let's not do it unless it's done right
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I'm so ready, ready, ready to love
Ready, ready, ready, love
Ready, ready, ready to love
Ready, ready, love
I'm so ready, ready, ready to love
Ready, ready, ready, love
Ready, ready, ready, ready

Ready, ready to love
