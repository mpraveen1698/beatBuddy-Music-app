1 ContributorWeed Wit U LyricsYeah
I'm just tryna smoke a lil' weed with you
I'm just tryna roll a lil' weed with you
And talk about the stars
And smoke the weed with you
And if you feelin' me
Then I'ma probably leave with you

I'm just tryna smoke a lil' weed with you
I'm just tryna roll a lil' weed with you
We can have a good time baby
I know you independent
But tonight you mine baby
I love the way you keep it real
And never lie to me
I ain't no shooter but I know you probably ride with me

And that's important to me
And that's important to me
And that's important to me
And that's important to me
And that's important 'cause

I'm just tryna roll a lil' weed with you
I'm just tryna roll a lil' weed with you
I'm just tryna roll a lil' weed with you
I'm just tryna roll a lil' weed with you
