83 ContributorsAngel With A Shotgun Lyrics[Intro]
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah) I'm an angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun
(Oh yeah, oh yeah) Angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun

[Verse 1]
Get out your guns, battle's begun
Are you a saint or a sinner?
If love's a fight, then I shall die
With my heart on a trigger

[Pre-Chorus]
They say before you start a war
You better know what you're fighting for
Well baby, you are all that I adore
If love is what you need, a soldier I will be

[Chorus]
I'm an angel with a shotgun, fighting 'til the war's won
I don't care if heaven won't take me back
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe
Don't you know you're everything I have?
And I wanna live, not just survive tonight

[Verse 2]
Sometimes to win, you've got to sin
Don't mean I'm not a believer
And Major Tom will sing along
Yeah, they still say I'm a dreamer
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
They say before you start a war
You better know what you're fighting for
Well baby, you are all that I adore
If love is what you need, a soldier I will be

[Chorus]
I'm an angel with a shotgun, fighting 'til the war's won
I don't care if heaven won't take me back
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe
Don't you know you're everything I have?
And I wanna live, not just survive tonight

[Bridge]
Oh, oh whoa whoa, whoa
Oh, (Oh yeah) oh whoa (Oh yeah) whoa, (Oh yeah) whoa (Oh yeah)
Oh, (Oh yeah) oh whoa (I'm an angel with a shotgun, shotgun, yeah) (Oh yeah) whoa, (Oh yeah) whoa (Oh yeah)
Oh, (Oh yeah) oh whoa (I'm an angel with a shotgun, shotgun) (Oh yeah) whoa, (Oh yeah) whoa (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm an angel with a shotgun, fighting 'til the war's won
I don't care if heaven won't take me back
I'm an angel with a shotgun, fighting 'til the war's won
I don't care if heaven won't take me back
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe
Don't you know you're everything I have? (I'm an angel with a shotgun)
And I want to live, not just survive (Live, not just survive)
And I'm gonna hide, hide, hide my wings tonight
[Outro]
They say before you start a war
You better know what you're fighting for
Well baby, you are all that I adore
If love is what you need, a soldier I will be47Embed Angel With a Shotgun Symphony Soldier The Cab punk
