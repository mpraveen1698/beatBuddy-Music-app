No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
'Cause, 'cause, 'cause I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites, yeah
Mingle with the good people we meet, yeah
Good friends we have had, oh, good friends we've lost along the way, yeah
In this bright future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say, yeah

[Chorus]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, eh, yeah
Little darling don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Eh, said, said, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown, yeah
And then Georgie would make the fire light, I say
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge, I say
Of which I'll share with you, yeah
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
So no woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, I say
Oh, little, oh, little darling, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry, eh

[Chorus]
No woman, no woman, no woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
One more time I've got to say
Oh, little, little darling, please don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
