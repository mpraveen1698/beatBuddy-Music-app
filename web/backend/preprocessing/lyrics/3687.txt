You could take a photo
Eternalise this moment
For the days when I don't believe
When our love gets stolen
'Cause there's no exception
And I know time will take you far from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Let this night invade my lungs, you're all I wanna breathe
Right beside the lake, I burn for you, you burn for me

[Chorus]
So kiss me the way that you would
If we die tonight
Hold me the way that you would
For the final time
Whatever may come, somewhere deep inside
There's always this version of you and I
So just kiss me the way that you would
If we die tonight, if we die tonight, yeah

[Verse 2]
All the deepest secrets, all the darkest moments
Oh, I promise they'll be safe with me
We've all been broken, there's no exception
But you carry it so gracefully
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Let this night invade my lungs, you're all I want to breathe
Right beside the lake, I burn for you, you burn for me

[Chorus]
So kiss me the way that you would
If we die tonight
Hold me the way that you would
For the final time, yeah
Whatever may come, somewhere deep inside
There's always this version of you and I
So just kiss me the way that you would
If we die tonight, if we die tonight, yeah

[Bridge]
So I let this night in my lungs
You're all that I wanna breathe
Right beside you, down at the lake
I burn for you, you burn for me
Mm-mm-mm

[Chorus]
So kiss me the way that you would
If we die tonight
And hold me the way that you would
For the final time, yeah
Whatever may come, somewhere deep inside
There's always this version of you and I
So just kiss me the way that you would
If we die tonight, if we die tonight, yeah
[Outro]
If we die tonight, yeah (Ooh-ooh)
If we die tonight, yeahEmbed Kiss Me Songs of Sonder Dermot Kennedy folk
