Today, today, today
But I, I wanna feel how you feeling tonight
Alright, alright
So take away from your face all the make up
I wanna see you
And when you try to measure my respect girl
You can't use a ruler anyway
So take away from your hand on the coffee cup
I need you to believe
That's it comeing in like the waters moving I want you always

Bring me along, take me anywhere
Bring me along, along
Bring me along, take me anywhere
Bring me along, along

I, I pull the white sheets from off my face
Oh I love your ways, your ways, your ways
And I, I want you to hear what I have to say
Today, today, today
So wipe the morning form your eyes little angel
I wanna see you
Though sometime you try to push yourself away form me
I hope that's something that you never do
So take away from your hand on the coffee cup
I need you to believe
That's it coming in
Like the waters moving
I want you always
