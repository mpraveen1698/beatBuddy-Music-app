11 ContributorsDonâ€™t Stop Dancing Lyrics[Verse 1]
At times life is wicked
And I just can't see the light
A silver lining sometimes isn't enough
To make some wrongs seem right

[Refrain]
Whatever life brings
I've been through everything
And now I'm on my knees again

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know, I must go on
Although I hurt, I must be strong
Because inside, I know
That many feel this way

[Chorus]
Children, don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly away, away

[Verse 2]
At times life's unfair
And you know it's plain to see
Hey, God, I know I'm just a dot in this world
Have You forgot about me?

I've been through everything
And now I'm on my knees again

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know, I must go on
Although I hurt, I must be strong
Because inside, I know
That many feel this way

[Chorus]
Children, don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly away, away

[Bridge]
Am I hiding in the shadows?
Forget the pain and forget the sorrows
Am I hiding in the shadows?
Forget the pain and forget the sorrows

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know, I must go on
Although I hurt, I must be strong
Because inside, I know
That many feel this way
[Chorus]
Children, don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly away, away

Children, don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly away, away

Children, don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly away, away

[Outro]
Am I hiding in the shadows?
Are we hiding in the shadows?Embed Don't Stop Dancing Weathered Creed grunge
