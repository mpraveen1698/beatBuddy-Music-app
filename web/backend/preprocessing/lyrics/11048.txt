16 ContributorsHold On Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've been on this road too long
Hearing music but it's not your song
Wanna scream but your voice is gone
Days trapped inside your head

[Verse 2]
Can't look up cause your world is down
Walking miles staring at the ground
All alone inside the crowd
Letting pockets hold your hand

[Pre-Chorus]
But the sun is always there to shine
The clouds block out the sky

[Chorus]
Oh hold on
Just one more day
Hold on
You know you'll find a way
Hold on
You've got stars in your eyes
So let's paint the sky

Oh hold on
Just one more time
Hold on
I'll be your reason why
Hold on
You've got stars in your eyes
So let's paint the sky
So let's paint the sky

It's time to start remembering dreams
Lift your eyes see the things unseen
Remember who you wanna be
Let the light hit your eyes

[Verse 4]
Let out the beauty that's been trapped inside
Let them know that you're not gonna hide
Hey up there your arms open wide
Spread your wings and fly

[Pre-Chorus]
But the sun is always there to shine
The clouds don't own the sky

[Chorus]
Oh hold on
Just one more day
Hold on
You know you'll find a way
Hold on
You've got stars in your eyes
So let's paint the sky

Oh hold on
Just one more time
Hold on
I'll be your reason why
Hold on
You've got stars in your eyes
So let's paint the sky
[Bridge]
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
You've got stars in your eyes
So let's paint the sky

[Chorus]
Oh hold on
Just one more day
Hold on
You know you'll find a way
Hold on
You've got stars in your eyes
So let's paint the sky

Oh hold on
Just one more time
Hold on
I'll be your reason why
Hold on
You've got stars in your eyes
So let's paint the sky
[Outro]
Oh hold on, Oh hold on, Oh hold on
You've got stars in your eyes
So let's paint the sky

Oh hold on, Oh hold on, Oh hold on
You've got stars in your eyes
So let's paint the sky
So let's paint the sky4Embed Hold On Glory Pop 2 Extreme Music blues
