3 ContributorsThere Is No Wonderwall LyricsI haven’t been myself
And it’s been way too long
Tell me you’re someone else, too
So we can both be in the wrong

We’ll never see what we could have been
Won’t reach the end result
You want to believe that I have it in me
But that’s not how the story goes

I don’t want to see
You lying next to me
While you could have it all
I know you want to be the one who sets me free
But you can’t save my soul
There is no wonderwall

If therе’s some kind of evil
That eats mе from inside
It won’t be drowned in a bottle
I know ‘cause I’ve tried every night

I don’t want you to be near me and the mess I’m in
Won’t watch your hopes dissolve
Many times I tried to change the man I have been and
Forget what I’ve been told
You might also likeI don’t want to see
You lying next to me
While you could have it all
I know you want to be the one who sets me free
But you can’t save my soul
There is no wonderwall

There is no wonderwall

You want someone that you can contain
I’ve seen many try, it was all in vain
Please don’t see what I’ve seen
Deal with what sits within me
No, that’s not how the story goes

I don’t want to see
You lying next to me
While you could have it all
I know you want to be the one who sets me free
But you can’t save my soul
There is no wonderwall
