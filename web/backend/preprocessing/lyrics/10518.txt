And your love casts its shadow on the things I do
And I can hear so clearly all the words I'd wish I'd said
You're stuck in my head
But I only think of you
Will we be together soon?
I'm thrown to the wayside
You're planted it in my mind
But I don't wanna be okay without youYou might also likeEmbed PlantedInMyMind.Memo PlantedInMyMind.Memo Charlie Burg soul
