4 ContributorsGive Me A Reason Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me do you got a doctor
To stitch me back up
And help bring us back to life?
We're giving up on the hard work
'Bout to fall off like a love suicide

[Pre-Chorus]
Throw us a funeral now
I'll wear my black gown
When they put us six feet down

[Chorus]
I still adore you
But we've been dying a little
Don't keep me stuck in the middle
Give me a reason to try
We're gonna lose
You know I don't want to hurt you
But we've been going in circles
Give me a reason to fight

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm still wearing your sweatshirt
Gives me good luck
Reminds me of our old times
When everything used to be better
Before kissing and touching
Turned into sleepless nights, oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Throw us a funeral now
I'll wear my black gown
When they put us six feet down

[Chorus]
I still adore you
But we've been dying a little
Don't keep me stuck in the middle
Give me a reason to try
We're gonna lose (We're gonna lose)
You know I don't want to hurt you
But we've been going in circles
Give me a reason to fight

[Bridge]
You know that I love you (I love you)
Even when it's hard to
We've got what money can't buy
So give me a reason to try (Give me a reason to)

[Chorus]
I still adore you
But we've been dying a little
Don't keep me stuck in the middle
Give me a reason to fight
Give me a reason to fight
Give me a reason to fight2Embed Give Me A Reason Give Me A Reason Jillian Rossi songwriter
