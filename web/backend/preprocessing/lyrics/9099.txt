I'm a flash, oh, you were blinded by the love I had
I'm a flash, the light could only get in through the cracks

[Chorus]
And you've gotta do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph

[Verse 2]
When they crashed the helicopters in my heart, it ripped
Cut in half, you saw me lying there bleeding to death

[Chorus]
And you had to do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph

[Bridge]
Now I stand on the stage
I forget my lines to your play "Satan's Imagination"
And a voice in my head's causing suicide searching for any way to remember them

[Chorus]
And you've got to do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in my photographSee Cigarettes After Sex LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like7Embed Flash Cigarettes After Sex Cigarettes After Sex ambient
