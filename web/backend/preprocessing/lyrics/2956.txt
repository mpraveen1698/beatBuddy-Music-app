Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I messed up tonight, I lost another fight
I still mess up, but I'll just start again
I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground
But I always get up now to see what's next

[Pre-Chorus]
Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up
Nobody learns without getting it wrong

[Chorus]
I won't give up, no, I won't give in
Till I reach the end and then I'll start again
No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no, I won't give in
Till I reach the end and then I'll start again
No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

[Verse 2]
Look how far you've come, you filled your heart with love
Baby, you've done enough, take a deep breath
Don't beat yourself up, don't need to run so fast
Sometimes we come last, but we did our best

[Chorus]
I won't give up, no, I won't give in
Till I reach the end and then I'll start again
No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no, I won't give in
Till I reach the end and then I'll start again
No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

[Bridge]
I'll keep on making those new mistakes
I'll keep on making them every day
Those new mistakes
[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Try everything)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Try everything)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Try everything)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
