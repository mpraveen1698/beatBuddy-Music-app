15 ContributorsI Wonâ€™t Let The Sun Go Down On Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Forty winks in the lobby, make mine a G&T
Then to our favorite hobby, searching for an enemy
Here in our paper houses, stretching for miles and miles
Old men in stripy trousers rule the world with plastic smiles

[Pre-Chorus]
Good or bad, like it or not
It's the only one we've got

[Chorus]
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down

[Verse 2]
Mother Nature isn't in it, three hundred million years
Goodbye in just a minute, gone forever, no more tears
Pinball man, power glutton, vacuum inside his head
Forefinger on the button, is he blue or is he red?

[Pre-Chorus]
Break your silence if you would
Before the sun goes down for good

[Chorus]
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
