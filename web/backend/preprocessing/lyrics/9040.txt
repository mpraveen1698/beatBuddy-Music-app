Glory

[Verse 1]
This is not another story
This is not another drill
I refuse to be another number now, never staying down
This is something real
I'm a name that you'll remember
I am more than just a thrill
I am gonna be the greatest ever now; watch out
I'm a force that you will feel

[Pre-Chorus]
And it goes something like (Woo-ooh)
I'm victorious (Woo-ooh)
It's my time (Woo-ooh)
There's no stopping this
'Cause I was born for this

[Chorus]
I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-ooh-oh, woo-oh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Woo-ooh-ooh)

I'll be written in the stars

Even when it's hard
Oh, I started as an ember
Who was meant for kerosene
And now I'm raging like a fire, burning up
Through everything I see

[Pre-Chorus]
And it goes something like (Woo-ooh)
I'm victorious (Woo-ooh)
It's my time (Woo-ooh)
There's no stopping this
'Cause I was born for this

[Chorus]
I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-ooh-oh, woo-oh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Woo-ooh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Wo-oh-ooh-oh, woo-oh-ooh)
I do it for the glory
(Woo-ooh-ooh)

They'll remember
Oh, they'll remember us
