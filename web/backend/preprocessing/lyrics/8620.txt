10 ContributorsParallel Parking Lyrics[Chorus]
Her smile is picking up my heartbeat
You ever felt stuck in between two things?
I ain't talkin' 'bout parallel parking
And right when she's 'bout to leave
Thank god that-that you dropped your car keys
I picked 'em up and said, "Hey, these are yours
Hit me for dinner if you're ever bored
'Cause you and me, we'll get along for sure"

[Verse]
Her smile could light up the city
I don't care about weather 'cause you are the view
Drivе from the Bay down to LA to find a best hotel
And book us a dinnеr for two
Her Jeep been parked in the driveway
I gotta run 'cause she's waiting for me
I'm always mad 'cause she get ready slow
And we got an entire world to see
I know when we're older, we'll miss this
Couple of young, broke misfits
Running from something that we'll never know
And we gonna find out when we hit the road

[Chorus]
Her smile is picking up my heartbeat
You ever felt stuck in between two things?
I ain't talkin' 'bout parallel parking
And right when she's 'bout to leave
Thank god that-that you dropped your car keys
I picked 'em up and said, "Hey, these are yours
Hit me for dinner if you're ever bored
'Cause you and me, we'll get along for sure"
Her smile is picking up my heartbeat
You ever felt stuck in between two things?
I ain't talkin' 'bout parallel parking
And right when you're 'bout to leave
Thank god that you dropped your car keys
I picked 'em up and said, "Hey, these are yours
Hit me for dinner if you're ever bored
'Cause you and me, we'll get along for sure"
