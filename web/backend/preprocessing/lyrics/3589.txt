10 ContributorsBack to Friends Lyrics[Verse 1]
Guess you were right to hide the way you feel
We’d keep pretending like it wasn’t real
Said you need space and now I finally understand
Why you refused to take my hand
When you’re in love it’s hard to hide the truth
I know you better than you think I do
Looking back, I see I should’ve held my tongue
But I was immature and young

[Pre-Chorus]
I miss the uncertainty and all the nights of losing sleep
Just two kids and make-believe
Can we go back to how it used to be?

[Chorus]
'Cause I’d die a thousand times
Not to have you on my mind
And I wish we never met or I hated you instead
'Cause I think we messed this up
Falling in and out of love
Wish I could pick a different end
Can we go back to being friends?

[Verse 2]
Guess I’m the right person at the wrong time
I’m the type of crazy to ignore the signs
And now I see you’ve got some shit to figure out
And that’s the reason you can’t love me now
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I miss the uncertainty and all the nights of losing sleep
Just two kids and make-believe
Can we go back to how it used to be?

[Chorus]
'Cause I’d die a thousand times
Not to have you on my mind
And I wish we never met or I hated you instead
'Cause I think we messed this up
Falling in and out of love
Wish I could pick a different end
Can we go back to being friends?

[Bridge]
Uh uh uh
Can we go back to being friends?
Uh uh uh
Can we go back to being friends?

[Outro]
'Cause I’d die a thousand times
Not to have you on my mind
And I wish we never met or I hated you instead
'Cause I think we messed this up
Falling in and out of love
If I could pick a different end
I’d go back to being friendsEmbed Back to Friends Back to Friends Lauren Spencer Smith singer-songwriter
