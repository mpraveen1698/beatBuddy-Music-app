23 ContributorsChasing Thunder Lyrics[Verse 1]
I heard a story years ago
From my grandmama, rest her soul
'Bout a girl who'd never grow up
Never grow old, oh
She was wild, she was free
Faced the fire fearlessly
That's the spirit, that's the ghost inside of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm not a rose, I'm a wildflower
Out of all of them, you chose one who'll run free forever
Doesn't mean I'm lost, I just like to wander
Got that gypsy blood, always chasin thunder

[Chorus]
Always chasin thunder
Always chasin thunder
Always chasin thunder
Always chasin thunder
Chasin thunder, always chasin thunder
Got that gypsy blood, always chasin thunder

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Got that gypsy blood, always chasin thunder

I remember when twenty-five
Was forever in my mind
I wish I could go back in time
Oh, I would if I could, but I can't
Told myself that life flies by
We all live and we all die
Keep the sun and moon and stars, girl, in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm not a rose, I'm a wildflower
Out of all of them, you chose one who'll run free forever
Doesn't mean I'm lost, I just like to wander
Got that gypsy blood, always chasin thunder

[Chorus]
Always chasin thunder
Always chasin thunder
Always chasin thunder
Always chasin thunder
Chasin thunder, always chasin thunder
Got that gypsy blood, always chasin thunder

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Got that gypsy blood, always chasin' thunder
[Bridge]
All the beauty and the bad
Makes me happy, makes me sad
'Cause I know that nothin' lasts forever
I'll keep runnin', chasin' thunder
All the beauty and the bad
Makes me happy, makes me sad
'Cause I know that nothin' lasts forever
I'll keep runnin', chasin' thunder

[Outro]
Ooh
Oh, oh
Baby, I'm not a rose, I'm a wildflower
So I'm gonna keep on chasin' thunder
