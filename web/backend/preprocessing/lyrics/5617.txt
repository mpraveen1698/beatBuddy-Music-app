American woman
Stay away from me
American woman
Mama, let me be
Don't come a-hangin' around my door
I don't wanna see your face no more
I got more important things to do
Than spend my time growin' old with you
Now, woman
I said stay away

Get away from me
American woman
Mama, let me be
Don't come a-knockin' around my door
Don't wanna see your shadow no more
Coloured lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes
Now, woman
I said get away
American woman
Listen what I say, hey

Said get away
American woman
Listen what I say
Don't come a-hangin' around my door

I don't need your ghetto scenes
Coloured lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes
