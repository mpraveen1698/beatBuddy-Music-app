1 ContributorLove LyricsAnd love ..
Such a silly game we play, oh
Like a summer's day in May
What is love, what is love?
I just want it to be love
Oooh

And I, I, I, I, I... I can feel it in your kiss
It just gives me tender bliss
What is love, what is love?
I just want it to be love
Oooh

When I feel you around
I was mad as hell when I hit the ground
When I see you laugh away
It hurts but I just won't say
Oh, oh, oh... Love ...

Who can tell me I am wrong?
I just think that I am strong

What is love, what is love?
I just want it to be love
Ooooh

I was so upset we fell on the ground
When I see you mad at me
It was such a silly thing
Ooooooh

And love ..
Such a silly game we play
Like a summer's day in May
What is love, what is love?
I just want it to be love
Ooooh. oh

And I, I, I, I, I... I can feel it in a kiss
It is something I will miss
What is love, what is love?
I just want you to be loveEmbed Love Best Days Matt White acoustic
