Fuckin' Robitussin
I don't know why this shit got me lazy right now, yeah
Can't do Percocets or Molly
I'm turnin' one, tryna live it up here right, right, right

Baby, you can ride it, ooh yeah
Bring it over to my place
And you be like, "Baby, who cares?"
But I know you care
Bring it over to my place

[Chorus]
You don't know what you did, did to me
Your body language, speaks to me
I don't know what you did, did to me
Your body language, speaks to me

[Post-Chorus]

I can make it hurricane on it
Hunnid bands, make it rain on it
Tie it up, put a chain on it
Make you tattoo my name on it, oh
Make you cry like a baby, yeah
Let's Go Pro and make a video, yeah
Make you cry like a baby, yeah
Let's Go Pro and make a video
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
