24 ContributorsCherry Lyrics[Verse 1]
Cherry
Tells me some things I don't want to know
And I can't see
A light at the end for us anymore

[Chorus]
But I can't keep crying
All of the time
No, I can't keep crying
All of the time

[Verse 2]
Cherry
Can be very sweet when she needs a friend
But it's only
A mask that she wears so she can pretend

[Chorus]
And I can't keep running
All of the time
No, I can't keep running
All of the time

[Verse 3]
Cherry
I hate that it's true but you make me blue
I kept waiting
For you to find what I see in you
You might also like[Chorus]
And I can't keep quiet
All of the time
No, I can't keep quiet
All of the time11Embed Cherry Cherry (Deluxe) Chromatics synth-pop
