I don't need you to sell me on reasons to want you
I don't need you to search for the proof that I should
You don't have to convince me
You don't have to be scared you're not enough
'Cause what we've got going is good

I don't need more reminders of all that's been broken
I don't need you to fix what I'd rather forget
Clear the slate and start over
Try to quiet the noises in your head
We can't compete with all that

So what if it's us?
What if it's us
And only us
And what came before won't count anymore or matter?
Can we try that?
What if it's you
And what if it's me
And what if that's all that we need it to be
And the rest of the world falls away?
What do you say?

[EVAN]
I never thought there'd be someone like you who would want me
You might also like[ZOE, spoken]
Well...

[EVAN]
So I give you ten thousand reasons to not let me go
But if you really see me
If you like me for me and nothing else
Well, that's all that I've wanted for longer than you could possibly know

So it can be us
It can be us
And only us
And what came before won't count anymore or matter
We can try that

[EVAN & ZOE]
It's not so impossible

[EVAN]
Nobody else but the two of us here

[EVAN & ZOE]
'Cause you're saying it's possible

[ZOE]
We can just watch the whole world disappear
[EVAN & ZOE]
'Til you're the only one
I still know how to see

[EVAN]
It's just you and me

[ZOE]
It'll be us
It'll be us
And only us
And what came before won't count anymore

[EVAN & ZOE]
We can try that
You and me
That's all that we need it to be
And the rest of the world falls away
And the rest of the world falls away

The world falls away
The world falls away
And it's only us12Embed Only Us Dear Evan Hansen (Original Broadway Cast Recording) Laura Dreyfuss;Ben Platt show-tunes
