She's my Camellia, sheltered from media
Healthier than expected, that’s how she grew up
Claimed to be a self-made, not that she's unaware
Won't let these hours go to waste
Depend on no bottle
Baby, you’re better than liquor
Actin' like I always knew her
She's my Camellia, your love is so universal
Keepin' me company, baby, your honesty
Holdin' that harmony

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me love, how do you do it?
Never once thought I would lose ya
And when you're having a hard time
Let me know, baby let me know
You're the only friend that I have
That I know I can trust
That I know I can love yeah

[Chorus]
She's my Camellia, sheltered from media
Healthier than expected, that’s how she grew up
Claimed to be a self-made, not that she’s unaware
Won't let these hours go to waste
Depend on no bottle
Baby, you’re better than liquor
Actin' like I always knew her
She's my Camellia, your love is so universal
Keepin' me company, baby, your honesty
Holdin’ that harmony

We need some time to rest
Care for ourselves yeah
Love without borders, love with no cautions
Smoke it up often
Pink like the love in my heart
Babe, it don't have to be hard
One step at a time, we can make it
Swear on my life I won't change
Sometimes we put ourselves in difficult situations
But I feel like we're gonna make it
You're strong, you're strong, you're strong

[Chorus]
She's my Camellia, sheltered from media
Healthier than expected, that's how she grew up
Claimed to be a self-made, not that she's unaware
Won't let these hours go to waste
Depend on no bottle
Baby, you're better than liquor
Actin' like I always knew her
She's my Camellia, your love is so universal
Keepin' me company, baby, your honesty
Holdin' that harmony
