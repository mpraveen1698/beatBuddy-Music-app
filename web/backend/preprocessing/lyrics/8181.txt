20 ContributorsNeither Do I Lyrics[Intro: Jeremih]
Yeah

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Let's take off the top, go hit the club
Do you know what it feels like to fall in love?
Take off your top, ready to fuck (Girl), yeah
Do you know what it feels like to fall in love, girl?

[Post-Chorus: Jeremih]
Neither do I
I say we find out, cover your eyes
Well, go turn the lights out
I know you want it from the way you like to move, girl
Why you frontin' like you ain't got nothing to lose, girl? Yeah
I'm just tryna make a move, girl
Got you in the nude, girl, yeah

[Verse: Jeremih]
I remember days when
This wouldn't go the same before I was famous
It's true we out here chasing bitches, now I'm done with that
I came up and now I'm rich, I got somethin' wrong with that
But you different than these women, got me coming back
Can't let anybody have you, can't have none of that, yeah
