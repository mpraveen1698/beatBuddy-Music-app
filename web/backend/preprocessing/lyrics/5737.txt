14 ContributorsHero Lyrics[Intro]
You, you, ooh

[Verse 1]
Little girl, only seventeen years old
Life just got in the way, don't know what to say
She's heard it all before, lying on her bedroom floor
Thinking "My life has to be worth more"
She dreams of going to New York City
Her heart's already there but her head's fighting a war
Little girl, only seventeen years old
Looking for a star, but it's just too dark

[Pre-Chorus]
When streams get a little bit wider
And it's hard to swim across the water
And the scars get a little bit deeper
And a flame turns into a fire

[Chorus]
Tonight whеn you need a way home
Someone to lеan on, some kind of hero
It's there when you look in the mirror
Staring back at you, there's a hero in you

[Drop]
You, you, ooh
There's a hero in you
You, you, ooh
There's a hero in you

Old man trying to make it on his own
Looking at the space where his wife once was
Wants to find just something to believe in
He hears a knock at the door this evening
She says, "I'm going to New York City to follow my dreams
Would you come with me?"
Little girl, only seventeen years old
Looking at the stars in her granddad's eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
And the streams get a little bit wider
But together they cross the river
And the scars get a little bit lighter
And the sky looks a little brighter

[Chorus]
Tonight when you need a way home
Someone to lean on, some kind of hero
It's there when you look in the mirror
Staring back at you, there's a hero in you

[Drop]
You, you, ooh
There's a hero in you
You, you, ooh
There's a hero in youEmbed Hero Hero Afrojack;David Guetta progressive-house
