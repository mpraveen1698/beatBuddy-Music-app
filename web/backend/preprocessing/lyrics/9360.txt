3 ContributorsKeep On Dancing LyricsAll I heard about was all your love
Wrapped in lies, oh oh
Showing off, pretending to be nice
All I heard about was all your love
But you crossed the line, oh, but I got no
Heartache, heartbreak, grief about you now

No I will keep dancing
I will keep dancing
Till the sun comes up, till I’m running out of luck, oh I’m going on till dawn
Oh I will keep dancing
I will keep dancing
When the game’s still on, and I’m all the way in for more
Oh I will keep on dancing
Da da da da la da da dancing
For more

Tomorrow I will see you on your knees
Begging, oh oh oh oh
I need you, look at me, we could bring us back
Don’t tell me all you feel is you regret
Wrapped in lies, oh
Cause I knew, you would blew it, mess up all again

No I will keep dancing
I will keep dancing
Till the sun comes up, till I’m running out of luck, oh I’m going on till dawn
Oh I will keep dancing
I will keep dancing
When thе game’s still on, and I’m all the way in for more
Oh I will keep on dancing
Da da da da la da da dancing
