1 ContributorAround (Solomun Vox Mix) Lyrics[Verse]
Have you ever felt like you've been hurt before?
By the ones that said they only loved you more?
Inflicted pain and scars of sorrow
Like an empty shell I wait for tomorrow...
I sit here wondering why you walked away
Did I ever do you wrong in any way?
Was it something I said to you that made you change?
There is no more sun, there's only cloudy days
Yeah

[Chorus]
What goes around will come around and come back in and getcha
What goes around will come around and come back in and getcha

[Verse]
Have you ever felt like you've been hurt before?
By the ones that said they only loved you more?
Inflicted pain and scars of sorrow
Like an empty shell I wait for tomorrow...
I sit here wondering why you walked away
Did I ever do you wrong in any way?
Was it something I said to you that made you change?
There is no more sun, there's only cloudy days

[Verse]
Have you ever felt like you've been hurt before?
By the ones that said they only loved you more?
Inflicted pain and scars of sorrow
Like an empty shell I wait for tomorrow...
I sit here wondering why you walked away
Did I ever do you wrong in any way?
Was it something I said to you that made you change?
There is no more sun, there's only cloudy days
Yeah
