20 ContributorsHiding in the Dark Lyrics[Intro]
Have you ever fell apart? Tell me you know what it's like
Hiding in the dark, always looking for the light

[Chorus]
Have you ever fell apart? Tell me you know what it's like
Hiding in the dark, always looking for the light
I've been feeling so alone, I've been trapped in my mind
And it's all I've ever known, I've been dying inside
I don't know where to start, I got way too many questions
Bleeding from the heart, I can't handle my reflection
Feel like no one's told me to look in myself
Tried to do it on my own, but I really need help, I'm falling

[Verse 1]
Hеre we go again, it's just another sad song
Grab thе mask and play pretend but everything is going wrong
You say it's okay, but I don't know how to feel
Anything but cloudy gray, so I take another pill
Leave me to burn, I'm crashing down
I didn't mean to hurt you, I'm lashing out
I don't think you understand it
Guess I'm pessimistic, it's just been so hard to manage
Damn, I'm coming undone, but I hang on tightly
Don't fall, is there anybody like me?
I need your voice, so make it loud and clear
I'll try to drown the noise and face all my fears
I hide away, but I'll find a way to make it out of this, and I promise
I'll get away 'cause there's better days ahead, that's what you said, but
You might also like[Chorus]
Have you ever fell apart? Tell me you know what it's like
Hiding in the dark, always looking for the light
I've been feeling so alone, I've been trapped in my mind
And it's all I've ever known, I've been dying inside
I don't know where to start, I got way too many questions
Bleeding from the heart, I can't handle my reflection
Feel like no one's told me to look in myself
Tried to do it on my own, but I really need help, I'm falling

[Verse 2]
Way too many nights just staring out into the void
I should jump, but if I did, another life will be destroyed
Maybe I'm useless, I'm just exhausted
I've been counting my losses, now I found what the cost is
I'm down and low into the place I go
Where everything is crumbling and I lose hope
It's caving in, so just hold on close
The storm is coming in, but nobody ever knows it
I don't ever show it
Pencil to the paper, that's the way that I've been coping
Only dead roses, bring them to my grave, yeah
I'm sorry for the woes, I'll be strong another day

[Pre-Chorus]
Have you ever fell apart? Tell me you know what it's like
Hiding in the dark, always looking for the light
I've been feeling so alone, I've been trapped in my mind
And it's all I've ever known, I've been dying inside, -side, -side, -side, -side
[Chorus]
Have you ever fell apart? Tell me you know what it's like
Hiding in the dark, always looking for the light
I've been feeling so alone, I've been trapped in my mind
And it's all I've ever known, I've been dying inside
I don't know where to start, I got way too many questions
Bleeding from the heart, I can't handle my reflection
Feel like no one's told me to look at myself
Tried to do it on my own, but I really need help, I'm falling13Embed Hiding in the Dark Hiding in the Dark iamjakehill sad
