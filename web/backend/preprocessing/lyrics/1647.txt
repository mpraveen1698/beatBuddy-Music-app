We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again, again
I'll use my hands)

[Bridge]
Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonderland (I'll use my hands)21Embed Your Body Is a Wonderland Room For Squares John Mayer songwriter
