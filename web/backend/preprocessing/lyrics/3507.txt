I guess all the mountains that I moved just weren't enough
And all those nights I walked you home
From crowded bars when you were drunk
Well, they meant nothing 'cause you up and walked away
And I just wonder what it'd take to make you stay

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when you said, "Jump", I said, "How high?"
But when I jumped, you said, "Goodbye"

[Chorus]
I woulda walked through hell
To find another way
I woulda laid me down
If I knew that you would stay
I woulda crossed the stars
To keep you in my life
But now I'm falling hard
Without you here tonight
Without you here tonight

[Verse 2]
What did you do with all that love you couldn't give?
And do you need someone to help you?
Tell you what to do with it?
It must be nice to love someone who puts you first
Then walk away when they expect it in return

[Chorus]
I woulda walked through hell
To find another way
I woulda laid me down
If I knew that you would stay
I woulda crossed the stars
To keep you in my life
But now I'm falling hard
Without you here tonight
Without you here tonight

[Bridge]
You don't want me
Nothing I can do, 'cause
You don't wanna try

[Chorus]
I woulda walked through hell
To find another way
I woulda laid me down
If I knew that you would stay
I woulda crossed the stars
To keep you in my life
But now I'm falling hard
Without you here tonight
Without you here tonight
[Outro]
Without you here tonight
Without you here tonight6Embed Walked Through Hell Walked Through Hell Anson Seabra singer-songwriter
