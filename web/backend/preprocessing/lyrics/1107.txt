I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours, yours

[Verse 1]
9:05 in the evenin'
I'm all up in my feelings
I'm callin' your phone 'cause I can't get enough
And I got work in the mornin'
Early, early in the mornin'
But who needs sleep when we're lovin' it up? Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And why'd I gotta do this the hard way?
My body wants to be in your arms, bae, baby
Somethin' I'll regret in the mornin'
But I just can't resist when you're callin'

[Chorus]
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours, yours
That's what I said when I called you on the phone tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours

[Verse 2]
You know I sleep on the left side
If you sleep on the left side
I'd move to the right, yeah, I'd do it for you, oh-oh
And I got work in the mornin'
Early, early in the mornin'
But who needs sleep when I'm rockin' with you? Oh
