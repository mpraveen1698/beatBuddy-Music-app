5 ContributorsGecko (Overdrive) [Radio Edit] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take a moment for yourself
Get close with the lights down low
You and I and no one else
I get the feeling that I wanna explode
Baby you grab my attention
Tension burning, fever high
Take me to another dimension
Tonight the rules do not apply

[Hook]
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive

[Verse 2]
This is where I wanna be
Hands up, feel the bass in my heart
Give me faith and I will leap
I take the risk cause you're never too far
Right now I'm drowning in emotion
Caution flies right out the door
Baby you're pushing this devotion
I can only ask for more
You might also like[Hook]
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive

[Bridge]
When my head is spinning, all hands to the ceiling
I begin to come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive

[Outro]
Overdrive, overdrive
Overdrive, overdrive
Overdrive, overdrive
