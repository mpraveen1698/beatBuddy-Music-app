15 ContributorsThe Physical Attractions Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take your time
Listen to the song we wrote
And it could change your mind
When you hear it on the radio
I’m getting blackout drunk tonight
Said you don’t know where the good dope grows
But I get flame all the time
Just call me on the phone and you can always swing by

[Chorus]
'Cause I’d rather be at home playing video games
With the people that I’ve known since the glorious age
Because every now and then, I just don’t feel the same
Said you don’t know instead you swing low
I get high
I get low
If my heart stops beating
Will you let me know?

[Bridge]
I don’t know what your mind is going through
But I’m coming up dizzy just trying to love you
I know, oh oh, I know

[Verse 2]
Lights out (I fuckin' know what you’re saying)
We’ll give it all away now (We’ll give it all the way home)
We’re gonna give it away now (We’re gonna give it on home)
We’re gonna give it away now (We’re gonna give it on home)
Ah
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I’d rather be at home playing video games
With the people that I’ve known since the glorious age
Because every now and then, I just don’t feel the same
Said you don’t know instead you swing low
I get high
I get low
If my heart stops beating
Will you let me know?

[Outro]
I don't know what your mind is going through
But I'm coming up dizzy just trying to love you
I know oh oh oh oh
If you need fast cash in a flash you see
Front a sack flip it bring the rest back to me
I know oh oh oh oh9Embed The Physical Attractions The Symposium The Symposium garage
