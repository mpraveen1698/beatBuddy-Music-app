54 Contributors​overwhelmed Lyrics[Intro]
To report suspicious activity, you can call 911 for immediate response
And there’s still no word on a cure for the virus

[Verse 1]
Turn off the TV
It's starting to freak me
Out it's so loud
It's like my ears are bleeding
What am I feeling?
Can't look at the ceiling
The light is so bright
It's like I'm overheating

[Pre-Chorus]
This mind isn't mine
Who am I to judge?
Oh, I should be fine
But it's all too much

[Chorus]
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety keeps me silent
When I try to speak
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed

All of these faces
Who don't know what space is
And crowds are shut down
I'm overstimulated
Nobody gets it
Say I'm too sensitive
I can't listen 'cause I'm eyeing the exits

[Pre-Chorus]
This mind isn't mine
Who am I to judge?
Oh, I should be fine
But it's all too much

[Chorus]
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety keeps me silent
When I try to speak
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed
I get overwhelmed
[Bridge]
I should be fine, but it's all too much
I should be fine, but I'm not

[Chorus]
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed so easily
Keeps me silent
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed25Embed overwhelmed Overwhelmed Royal & the Serpent alternative
