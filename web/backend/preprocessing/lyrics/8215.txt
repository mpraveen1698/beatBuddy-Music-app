46 ContributorsBlessed Lyrics[Intro]
Cold mineral, cold pure water

[Wizkid]
Woah Woah

[Bridge: Damian Marley]
I might be rough around the edges, maybe yes
I keep it nappy and I do what make me happy
And nobody can deny me that I'm blessed
I might be rough around the edges, maybe yes
I keep it nappy and I do what make me happy
And nobody can deny me that I'm blessed

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Self preservation, self elevation
These kind of things they deserve celebration
No hesitation, no reservation
Go for the big leagues, no relegation
Let's celebrate life
Kick back and take five
And give thanks to the source that create life
To see a sun set or see a sun rise
And see my son born with these same eyes
To see my son smile, brighten every grey sky
He's growing so fast, that's why everyday I give it one hundred, nuh stop at 90
Praise the Almighty, the Father anoint me
