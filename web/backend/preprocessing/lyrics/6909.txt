16 ContributorsThe Fear Lyrics[Intro]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
You knocked me down, all the demons creepin' in, no
Another round tradin’ shots with my ego
Running can't help me now, your chains only drag me down
I've battled hard with the face in the mirror
Every scar makes me dig down deeper
I push it ’til there's nothin' more
'Cause I'm stronger than I was before

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time to stand up, stand up
Show me what you're made of
Hands up, hands up

[Chorus]
Fight the fear, fight the fear
Rise up from the ground, gonna make you a believer
Fight the fear, fight the fear
Blood, sweat, tears make the pain taste sweeter

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Fight the fear, fight the fear
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Rise up from the ground gonna make you a believer

[Verse 2]
Feel the pulse in my veins like a fighter
I'm the rush like the heat from the fire
Nothing can stop me now
I’ll scream it ’til my lungs give out, so

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time to stand up, stand up
Show me what you’re made of
Hands up, hands up

[Chorus]
Fight the fear, fight the fear
Rise up from the ground, gonna make you a believer
Fight the fear, fight the fear
Blood, sweat, tears make the pain taste sweeter

[Post-Chorus]
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Fight the fear, fight the fear
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Rise up from the ground gonna make you a believer
[Bridge]
Stand up, stand up, show me what you're made of
Hands up, hands up, show me what you're made of
It's time to stand up, stand up, show me what you’re made of
Hands up, hands up, show me what you're made of
It's time to stand up, stand up, show me what you're made of
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Hands up, hands up, show me what you're made of
