6 ContributorsScars Lyrics[Verse 1]
Waking up to a new sunrise
Looking back from the other side
I can see now with open eyes

[Verse 2]
Darkest water and deepest pain
I wouldn't trade it for anything
'Cause my brokenness brought me to You
And these wounds are a story You'll use

[Chorus]
So I'm thankful for the scars
'Cause without them I wouldn't know Your heart
And I know they'll always tell of who You are
So forever I am thankful for the scars

[Verse 3]
Now I'm standing in confidence
With the strength of Your faithfulness
And I'm not who I was before
No, I don't have to fear anymore

[Chorus]
So I'm thankful for the scars
'Cause without them I wouldn't know Your heart
And I know they'll always tell of who You are
So forever I am thankful for the scars

I can see, I can see
How you delivered me
In Your hands, in Your feet
I found my victory
I can see, I can see
How You delivered me
In Your hands, in Your feet
I found my victory

[Chorus 2]
I'm thankful for Your scars
'Cause without them I wouldn't know Your heart
And with my life, I'll tell of who You are
So forever I am thankful
I'm thankful for the scars
'Cause without them I wouldn't know Your heart
And I know they'll always tell of who You are
So forever I am thankful for the scars
So forever I am thankful for the scars5Embed Scars Trial & Triumph I AM THEY world-music
