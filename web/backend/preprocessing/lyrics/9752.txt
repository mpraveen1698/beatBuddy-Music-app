3 ContributorsTen Cane Row Lyrics[Intro: Protoje]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Protoje]
Right now me feel me woulda speak 'bout this queen I know
Meet her right outside of this one stage show
She tell me say she like how me sing "Same So"
And when she hear the bass, move her waist well slow
And she have her edges laid with 'bout ten cane row
The girl yah set a way, make you wan' stay close
She say if a today, she a go roll with Pro'
If she call me Oje, well, you know how that go
And she don't like to be seen, so shе want keep low
That's similar to me, move incognito
And take hеr off the scene, windows can't peep through
Go up inna the hills where the tall trees grow
To a location only we know
We reach we destination, what's the pree now?
We speak philosophy and things she read 'bout
Then view the constellation, blowing weed smoke

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
I like what you think about me
In this moment, just think about us
Say you prefer to be free
Don't you see that it's never enough?
I'm tryin' to give you what you need
My love, you'll receive if you really want
So let's proceed, moments like these
Ain't something that you got for too long
I'm trying hard to give it all to you
I'm trying hard to care 'cause you're still so special to me, baby
You might also like[Verse 2: Protoje]
So special, make you smile if you frown, take flight if you down
You hit my line, ring the phone, say you might in the town
Many nights spent alone, so you tempted to doubt
But you can't fend without me
Make love surround we
A queen in her glory, I'm lost in her gaze
Eyes bright like the morn', I'm avoiding the shade
Heart did cold, now it warm, used to dark like a spade
But she nah draw no card and me nah play no games
So, wha' you say?

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
I like what you think about me
In this moment, just think about us
Say you prefer to be free
Don't you see that it's never enough?
I'm tryin' to give you what you need
My love, you'll receive if you really want
So let's proceed, moments like these
Ain't something that you got for too long
I'm trying hard to give it all to you
I'm trying hard to care 'cause you're still so special to me, babyEmbed Ten Cane Row (feat. Jorja Smith) Ten Cane Row (feat. Jorja Smith) Protoje;Jorja Smith dancehall
