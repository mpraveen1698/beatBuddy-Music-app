32 ContributorsYou Say I’m in Love LyricsI’ve been so unafraid to die alone
I know what I’ve done, I heard your tone
Dust off your coat, the rain is coming back
A few months without it, keeps happiness on track
But you would never notice, stuck in that head of yours
You say I’m in love, I say I'm a fool
Look away from me now, I'll look away too
You say I’m in love, I say I'm a fool
Look away from me now, I'll look away tooYou might also like13Embed You Say I'm in Love You Say I'm in Love Banes World garage
