24 ContributorsSing Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby, you've been going so crazy
Lately, nothing seems to be going right
Solo, why do you have to get so low
You're so...
You've been waiting in the sun too long

[Chorus]
But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won't mean a thing
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing

[Verse 2]
Colder, crying over your shoulder
Hold her, and tell her everything's gonna be fine
Surely, you've been going too early
Hurry, cause no one's gonna be stopped
No,no,no,no

[Chorus]
But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won't mean a thing
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing

[Verse 3]
Baby, there's something going on today
But I say nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
So, na na na na
You might also like[Chorus]
But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won’t mean a thing
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing
Oh baby sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won’t mean a thing
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing15Embed Sing The Invisible Band Travis r-n-b
