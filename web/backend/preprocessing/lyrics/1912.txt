40 ContributorsTired Lyrics[Verse 1]
You haven't been good for long
Is it the sound of your own thoughts
That always keeps you up at night?
Maybe it's time to say goodbye
'Cause I'm getting pretty fucking tired

[Refrain]
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba

[Verse 2]
You haven't felt right for days
Is it the fact you never say
What comes in your mind that day?
Maybe it's time to shut away
'Cause I've never really felt okay

[Refrain]
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba

[Verse 3]
'Cause I've been eating less all day
To give my brain some extra space to think
'Bout all the things to do to help
Distract me from my mood, ah-ha
