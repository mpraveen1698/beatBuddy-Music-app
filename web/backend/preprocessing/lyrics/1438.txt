112 ContributorsBulls on Parade Lyrics[Intro]
Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now

[Verse 1]
The microphone explodes, shattering the mold
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin'
Quenchin' the thirst of the power dons
That five-sided Fistagon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The triggerâ€™s cold, empty your purse

[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells

[Verse 2]
Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal, I
Walk the corner to the rubble
That used to be a library, line up to the mind cemetery now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells
You might also like[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells

[Post-Chorus]
Bulls on parade, uh

[Outro]
Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
