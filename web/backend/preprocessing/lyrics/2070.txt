Think of me when you're out, when you're out there
I'll beg you nice from my knees
And when the world treats you way too fairly
Well, it's a shame I'm a dream

[Chorus]
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you

[Verse 2]
I think I'll pace my apartment a few times
And fall asleep on the couch
And wake up early to black-and-white reruns
That escape from my mouth (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you

[Verse 3]
I could follow you to the beginning
Just to relive the start
And maybe then, we'd remember to slow down
At all of our favorite parts
You might also like[Chorus]
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
