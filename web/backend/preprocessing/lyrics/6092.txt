3 ContributorsEYES Lyrics[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so down
When you're not with me
You blow my mind, feels so strong
I can get no sleep
I closed my eyes for so long
Since we danced so free
You know my heart wrote this song
Drowned in my weep

[Post-Chorus]
But this feeling is love
Yeah, this feeling is love
Yeah, this feeling is love
Yeah, this feeling is love

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so down
When you're not with me
You blow my mind, feels so strong
I can get no sleep
I closed my eyes for so long
Since we danced so free
You know my heart wrote this song
Drowned in my weep
