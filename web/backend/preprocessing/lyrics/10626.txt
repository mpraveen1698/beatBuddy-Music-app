29 ContributorsA Prophecy Lyrics[Verse 1]
How stubborn are the scars when they won't fade away?
Or just a gentle reminder that now are better days?
We'll be home soon, so dry your eyes
You'll be okay, you'll be okay!

[Verse 2]
Oh, my God! The water is rising! It's rising!
You just have to believe in me!
Sailing out, I'll ride this storm alone!
We can still make it out, fuck!

[Pre-Chorus]
I can help you through this, but you have to take my hand!
I can take you home, take my hand, take my hand!

[Chorus]
I should've known the tides were getting higher
We can still survive
And I think we're drowning, but our heads are still
Above the waves, above the waves

[Post-Chorus]
(I should've known the tides were getting higher)
(We can still survive above the waves)
(I should've known, the tides were getting higher)
(I should've known, the tides were getting higher)
We can still survive!

You never said goodbye!
You never said goodbye! Goodbye!17Embed A Prophecy Stand Up And Scream Asking Alexandria metalcore
