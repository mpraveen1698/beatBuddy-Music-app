1 ContributorLong Way Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is not what we wanted, I am lost, again
And oh I thought you would be the one to guide me in
And I wake at dawn, on a cold morning
To find you gone, you slipped away
And I belonged, but now I feel so out of place

[Chorus]
Well it's a long way down
When you fall in love and out
It's a long way down down down

[Verse 2]
What was once so familiar
What stood strong began to sway
And I felt at home
But now I know that home is just some place I stay

[Chorus]
And it's a long way down
When you fall in love and out
It's a long way down no

[Chorus]
It's a long way down
When you fall in love and out
It's a long way down down downYou might also likeEmbed Long Way Down Echos Joshua Hyslop acoustic
