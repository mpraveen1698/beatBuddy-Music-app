And I still hear the sound
Of your voice singin’ in my head
I can’t surrender
‘Cause the rope’s slowly coming apart
But hangin’ by a thread

It’s gone on
For too long
And this is it

So take a look into my eyes one last time
So we never forget
The way we were before
When we came alive at the moment we met
This is still worth fighting
Still worth fighting for

A glass that’s half-empty
Won’t wash away the mistakes
It only makes a mess
It’s worth defending
A tiny glimpse of what it would take
To make us better yet

It’s gone on
For too long
And this is it

So we never forget
The way we were before
When we came alive at the moment we met
This is still worth fighting for
A love that wants to live
I’ll give you all I’ve got to give
So let’s try one last time
So we never forget
This is still worth fighting
Still worth fighting for

Now that we know just who we are
Now that we’ve finally come this far
I’m ready for one more battle scar
‘Cause this is still worth fighting for

So take a look into my eyes one last time
So we never forget the way we were before
When we came alive at the moment we met
This is still worth fighting for
A love that wants to live
I’ll give you all I’ve got to give
So let’s try one last time
So we never forget
This is still worth fighting for
(I’m ready for one more battle scar)
This is still worth fighting for
(I’m ready for one more battle scar)
This is still worth fighting
We’re still worth fighting for11Embed Still Worth Fighting For My Darkest Days (Deluxe Edition) My Darkest Days metal
