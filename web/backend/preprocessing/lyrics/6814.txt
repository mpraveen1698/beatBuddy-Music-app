Drop dead cynical

[Verse 1: Elize Ryd]
I need attention, feed on my addiction
I want the action, satisfaction
You have to feed me words that I inquire
So my discord someday takes me higher

[Pre-Chorus: Henrik Englund]
I hope to thrill you, let expectations rise
I want to bring you somewhere you can't compromise
I'm coming at you like a cannonball
So here's the truth; you are drop dead cynical

[Chorus: Elize Ryd & Jake E. Lundberg]
Welcome to a new world
Open up the gates of paradise
Let's get cynical
Fall into a new maze
Open up your eyes and soon we're all
We're drop dead cynical
Drop dead cynical

[Verse 2: Jake E. Lundberg]
It's your illusion's fatal contradiction
I need the action, premonition
I like to thrill you, I am what inspires
Let you explode in a cosmic fire

You're Diogenes, enlightened Zeno's mind
Ten times a cynic as the man behind the shine
You make it hard to justify it all
See what you are; you are drop dead cynical

[Chorus: Elize Ryd & Jake E. Lundberg]
Welcome to a new world
Open up the gates of paradise
Let's get cynical
Fall into a new maze
Open up your eyes and soon we're all
We're drop dead cynical
(Cynical-cal-cal, cynical, cynical-cal)
Drop dead cynical
(Cynical-cal-cal, cynical, cynical-cal)
Drop dead cynical

[Bridge: Henrik Englund]
Dr-dr-dr-drop dead cynical
Dr-dr-dr-drop dead cynical

[Pre-Chorus: Henrik Englund]
I hope to thrill you, let expectations rise
I want to bring you somewhere you can't compromise
I'm coming at you like a cannonball
So here's the truth; you are drop dead cynical
[Chorus: Elize Ryd & Jake E. Lundberg]
Welcome to a new world
Open up the gates of paradise
Let's get cynical
Fall into a new maze
Open up your eyes and soon we're all
We're drop dead cynical2Embed Drop Dead Cynical MASSIVE ADDICTIVE Amaranthe goth
