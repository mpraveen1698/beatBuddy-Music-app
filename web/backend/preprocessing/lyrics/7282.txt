My heart gets lost like a message
My head is on the clouds and I don't get it
And so, I'm fashionably numb
Sometimes it helps to forget where we come from

[Verse 2]
Out of the mire, we were torn from, remember
Out of the fire again but I'm an ember
I'd hold a banner for you but it's upside down
You got a question or two but I'm tongue-tied now

[Chorus]
Don't try to follow me, I would
Hold you down if I could
Make you the enemy, I would
Let you down
Don't try to follow me, I would
Hold you down if I could
Make you the enemy, I would
Let you down

[Verse 3]
I took a ride on the champagne
You took a flight over San Fran Bay
We watched, it's all misunderstood
Your heart was warm like a brother's should
But then the gallow gave way
Sometimes they call after you
But you say

Don't try to follow me, I would
Hold you down if I could
Make you the enemy, I would
Let you down
Don't try to follow me, I would
Hold you down if I could
Make you the enemy, I would
Let you down

[Bridge]
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you

[Chorus]
Don't try to follow me, I would
Hold you down if I could
Make you the enemy, I would
Let you down
Don't try to follow me, I would
Hold you down if I could
Make you the enemy, I would
Let you down
[Outro]
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down, I hold you6Embed The Enemy Black Bear Andrew Belle acoustic
