10 ContributorsMore Than Friends Lyrics[Intro]
Uhh hello? anybody there?
Hello?

[Chorus]
Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now
Girl, let’s be more than friends starting now
Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now
Girl, let's be more than friends starting now

[Verse 1]
You’ve been replaying in my head
You make me feel like I can be myself instead
But I know you don't want me around
Your smile is irradiant, you make me feel like I can't quit
So give me something to work
I'm sorry but I'm not giving up now
WOO

[Chrous]
Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now
Girl, let's be more than friends starting now
Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now
Girl, let’s be more than friends starting now

[Verse 2]
I know you’re thinking the same thing
So why are you denying all these new feelings?
Cause I just wanted you around
You make me feel so crazy, even though you're kinda lazy
I just can’t hide this grieving
I'm sorry but I'm not giving up now
WOO

We're sorry, the number you have dialled is not in service at this time
The number you have dialled has been changed, their new number is...

Girl, let's be more than friends starting now
Cause girl, why won't you take it with me now
