20 ContributorsNothing Compares 2 U (Live at SiriusXM 2015) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been seven hours and sixteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whoever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, nothing can take away these blues

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares
To you

[Verse 2]
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me
Where did I go wrong?
I can throw my arms around any girl I choose
But it just reminds me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me
He said, "Boy, you better try to have fun
No matter what you do"
But he's a fool
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares
To you

[Verse 3]
All the flowers that you planted mama in your backyard
All died when you went away
And I know living with me is sometimes hard, but I'm willing
To give it another try

[Outro]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares
To you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares
To you
To you
To you3Embed Nothing Compares 2 U - Live At SiriusXM/2015 Chris Cornell (Deluxe Edition) Chris Cornell grunge
