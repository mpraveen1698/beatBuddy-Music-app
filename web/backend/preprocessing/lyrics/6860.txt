4 ContributorsOver 85 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Worked a midnight shift just to drive away to you
That's okay by me
You tell me to stay but you celebrate when I
Pull up to your street

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mind I could drive for a while
Told you, "Wait, I'm ready to ignite, ignite"

[Chorus]
I'm driving over 85, 85
Sliding through to you every night in my ride
I'm driving over 85 'cause I wanna be by your side
So I drive, drive, drive
In my ride, in my ride, in my ride
In my ride, in my ride, in my ride, yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been working and putting in all my time
Through the lows and highs
Shit gets boring but I know that I will be alright
'Cause I'm off in five

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mind I could drive for a while
Told you, "Wait, I'm ready to ignite, ignite"

I'm driving over 85, 85
Sliding through to you every night in my ride
I'm driving over 85 'cause I wanna be by your side
So I drive, drive, drive
85, 85
Sliding through to you every night in my ride
I'm driving over 85 'cause I wanna be by your side
So I drive, drive, drive
In my ride, in my ride, in my ride
In my ride, in my ride, in my ride1Embed Over 85 Over 85 Hojean chill
