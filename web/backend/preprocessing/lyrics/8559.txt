17 Contributors1984 Lyrics[Verse 1]
What if it's about you?
What if these tears are shed at your house too?
You will smear this shit on the white walls
In your own house with your fam, conscience is dead
I, I see the marching troops
Hurts, but I see friends there
Have no face, have no fate
Can't figure out, you're dumb or what?
Death and pain trails behind the crowd
What is it all about?

[Chorus]
Please stop the violence
Please stop the bloodshed on Earth
Look into the eyes of children who are scared
And remеmber, remembеr yourself
Please stop the violence
Please stop the bloodshed on Earth
My brother, my brother
Anger will live in memory
Anger will live and prevail

[Post-Chorus]
Pretend you are not guilty
Pretend you don't see this shit
Pretend this is not your war
Pretend, fuck

War
Their eyes are damned, their faith is crucified
War
Their tongue is stone, their tongue is dead
War
This son of a bitch will stick a knife in your back

1984, 1984
You woke up and saw a funnel instead of a home
You woke up and saw a funnel instead of a home
Ascend, adaption
1984, 1984
You woke up and saw a funnel instead of a home
And your anger will never leave you alone
You just need to find someone to blame

[Chorus]
Please stop the violence
Please stop the bloodshed on Earth
Look into the eyes of children who are scared
And remember, remember yourself
Please stop the violence
Please stop the bloodshed on Earth
My brother, my brother
Anger will live in memory
Anger will live and prevail
[Bridge]
Ascend, adaptation
1984, 1984 in real life
You woke up and saw a funnel instead of a home
And your anger will never leave you alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Anger will live in memory
Anger will live in memory
Anger will live in memory
Anger will live and prevailEmbed 1984 1984 Slaughter to Prevail death-metal
