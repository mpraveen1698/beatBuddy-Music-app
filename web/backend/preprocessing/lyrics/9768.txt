Contemplating, isolating
And it's stressing me out
Different visions, contradictions
Why won't you let me out?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I need a way to separate
But I promised you that I'll make sure you never forget me
(Never forget me)

[Chorus]
Now that you want it
Now that you need it
I'm too far gone
You're trying to blame me
But I'm not breaking
I'm telling you, I'm bulletproof (Bulletproof)
Believe me, I'm bulletproof (Bulletproof)
You made me so bulletproof (Bulletproof)
And now I'm too far gone

[Verse 2]
You're addicted and so twisted
That it's freaking me out
Distant eyes, it's no surprise
You can't do anything now
