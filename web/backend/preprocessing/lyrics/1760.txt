35 ContributorsVoices In My Head Lyrics[Verse 1]
The voices in my head keep on tellin' me to pray
'Cause I'm spinning like a carousel, circling the drain
Hit the bottom of the bottle, I don't wanna feel the pain
But that is all I got for now, I don't wanna talk about
The voices in my head keep on begging me to stay
If I pull the trigger now then the demons go away
And I know my time is coming so there ain't no time to waste
So that is all I got for now, I don't wanna talk about it
The voices in my head keep tellin' me to choose a side
It's heaven or hell like it's do or die
I'm a sad boy, you know better
Please don't make this last forever

[Pre-Chorus]
The voices in my head keep tellin' me I'm not okay
It's feeling like a hurricane in my brain
Dark clouds, hard times, bad weather
Please don't make this last forever

[Chorus]
Eye-e eye-e
The voices in my head keep on tellin' me I'm gonna die-ie-ie-ie
And I don't wanna talk about the drama, I'm traumati-i-i-i-ized
They're tellin' me I'm fine, but we both know that's a fuckin' lie-ie-ie-ie
I'm losing my mind, but I don't wanna talk about it

I'm a lost boy, you know better
Please don't make this last forever

[Pre-Chorus]
The voices in my head keep tellin' me that I'm insane
And maybe I'm a little bit, that won't change
Dark clouds, hard times, bad weather
Please don't make this last forever

[Chorus]
Eye-e eye-e
The voices in my head keep on tellin' me I'm gonna die-ie-ie-ie

[Bridge]
The voices in my head keep on tellin' me I'm cursed
I'm paranoid, I don't wanna make it any worse
We're all gonna die but first things first
I'ma take the world with me when they put me in the dirt
