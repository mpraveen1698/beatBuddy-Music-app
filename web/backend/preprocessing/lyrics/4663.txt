Blind me
Erase what was
Stillborn I have become

[Pre-Chorus]
The feelings I once felt are now dead and gone
I've waited here for you for so very long

[Verse 2]
So empty
Just a shell of a man
Stillborn, this I understand

[Pre-Chorus]
The feelings I once felt are now dead and gone
I've waited here for you for so very long

[Chorus]
I’ve waited here for you, so long
I’ve waited here for you, for you

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
The feelings I once felt are now dead and gone
I've waited here for you for so very long
You might also like[Chorus]
I’ve waited here for you, so long
I’ve waited here for you, so long
I’ve waited here for you, so long
I’ve waited here for you, for you11Embed Stillborn The Blessed Hellride Black Label Society hard-rock
