I'm not prepared for the future
So many things that I just don't know
I cut my hair, bought a new shirt, new pair of shoes and
It's time to go
I finally found an apartment
Signed a lease on a car this month
I can't go back to the start now, time doesn't slow down
I'm on my own

[Chorus]
Guess my childhood is over, now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm putting all my things inside a box next to a toaster
That's my closest thing to closure, I can't stop this roller coaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older
Guess my childhood is over, now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm telling all my friends we'll get together next October
That's my closest thing to closure, I can't stop this roller coaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

[Post-Chorus]
Bum, ba-da-da-da-da-da
Bum, ba-da-da-da-da-da
Bum, ba-da-da-da-da-da, dum, dum, dum

[Verse 2]
Never thought I'd be twenty
Now thirty don't seem so far away
I know I gotta make a little money, then maybe find somebody
To call my own
Mmm, I'm not ready, but I
Can't go back in time, I
Know it's all out of my control, now I know

Guess my childhood is over, now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm putting all my things inside a box next to a toaster
That's my closest thing to closure, I can't stop this roller coaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older
Guess my childhood is over, now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm telling all my friends we'll get together next October
That's my closest thing to closure, I can't stop this roller coaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

[Post-Chorus]

[Bridge]
Guess my childhood is over, one day I'll be buying posters
For my kids just like my parents did for me, it's never over
They'll grow up and soon enough they'll wish that time would just move slower
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

[Chorus]
Guess my childhood is over, now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm putting all my things inside a box next to a toaster
That's my closest thing to closure, I can't stop this roller coaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older
[Post-Chorus]
Bum, ba-da-da-da-da-da
Bum, ba-da-da-da-da-da
Bum, ba-da-da-da-da-da, dum, dum, dum
