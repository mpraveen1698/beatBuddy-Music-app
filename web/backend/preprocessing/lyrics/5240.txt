10 ContributorsLove Me Like a Friend Lyrics[Intro]
Every night, you're sleeping in my bed

[Verse 1]
Want you more every day
While tripping on the words I wish you would say
I get that late-night knock on my door
And I know exactly what you’re coming here for

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You went out with your girls
Told a lie, said you're lonely
They don't know who I am
They don’t know where you're going

[Chorus]
Every night, you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning, you're fucking with my head
Every night, you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning, you're fucking with my head
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
Every night, you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning, you love me like a friend

[Verse 2]
Sunrise coffee, I know
You'll take a sip and slip back into your clothes
Oh, every time you’re walking out of my door
I don’t think that you know what you're leaving here for

When you’re out (When you're out) with your girls (With you and your girls)
You can lie (Lie to me), say you're lonely (Lonely)
But you know (But you know) where I am (Where I am)
And I know (And I know) where you're going

[Chorus]
Every night, you’re sleeping in my bed
Every morning, you're fucking with my head
Every night, you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning, you're fucking with my head
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
Every night, you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning, you love me like a friend

[Bridge]
You've got a friend in me
And that's what's killing me
You've got a friend in me
And that's what's killing me

[Chorus]
Every night, you're sleeping in my bed (In my bed)
Every morning, you're fucking with my head (With my head)
Every night, you're sleeping in my bed (Oh, oh, oh)
Every morning, you're fucking with my head
[Chorus]
Every night, you're sleeping in my bed (Sleeping in my bed)
Every morning, you're fucking with my head
Every night, you're sleeping in my bed (Sleeping in my bed)
Every morning, you're fucking with my head
La-da-da-da-da (You're sleeping in my bed)
La-da-da-da-da (It's fucking with my head)
Every night, you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning, you love me like a friend

[Outro]

Every morning, you love me like a friendEmbed Love Me Like a Friend Happy About Everything Else... Fly By Midnight house
