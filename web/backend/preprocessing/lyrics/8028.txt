13 ContributorsNASCAR Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy, Joshreyy

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm in a fast car, whip that bitch like NASCAR
Molly in my jeans, I feel like shock, lil' bitch, that Wockhardt
These pussy boys act hard knowing that they not hard
They gon' steal my flow on they next song, but that shit not bars
Ayy, yeah, now I'm all in, all in
Fuck these bitches, I keep falling, falling
Got this money, now I'm balling, balling
Bitch, I'm in a fast car, whip that bitch like NASCAR
Bitch, I'm hauling

[Verse]
Ass, yeah, I'm gon' get the cash, yeah
If the cops slide, nigga, I'm gon' do the dash, yeah
If you outside, nigga, best not be a rat, yeah
'Cause we prepared for that, bitch ass nigga better have a strap
I don't give a fuck 'bout none of that, bitch, I stay gassed up
Bitch, I say a lot of dumb shit, but don't ask, yeah
These bitch ass niggas always on my dick, that shit sad, yeah
But I see why you mad 'cause a nigga getting cash, yeah
These niggas, they mad, and it's sad, 'cause they going out bad
Fuck yo' bitch, yeah, I don't care 'bout none of that
Just want the cash, get the racks, yeah, I'm 'bout all of that
