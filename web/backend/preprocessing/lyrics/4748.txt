Life is a voyage, some people try to avoid it
I seek to try and destroy it, I swear I feel like a toilet bowl
Shitting on everything I've ever said or I've done
You told me this should be fun, thanks for the talk, are we done?
This is my masterpiece, a tragedy, I wrote it myself
It's full of irony and blasphemy, it's practically hell
But the perfect part about it is it's all that I've got
I'm over wasting time in life trying to be something I'm not

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause fuck that shit
Yeah, I don't wanna be that kid
No, I'm not gonna hang my head
And be another accident

[Chorus]
So long to the kid that I used to know
So long to the place that I used to go
I'm not an R.I.P. I'm not another sick, sad tragedy
So long to the kid that I used to know
So long to the place that I used to go
I'm not an R.I.P. I'm not another sick, sad tragedy

[Verse 2]
Do you ever feel like you're underwater?
Drowning inside like there's no tomorrow?
Life gets tough but you should know
That I don't plan on letting go
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause fuck that shit
Yeah, I don't wanna be that kid
No, I'm not gonna hang my head
And be another accident

[Chorus]
So long to the kid that I used to know
So long to the place that I used to go
I'm not an R.I.P. I'm not another sick, sad tragedy
So long to the kid that I used to know
So long to the place that I used to go
I'm not an R.I.P. I'm not another sick, sad tragedy

[Bridge]
When the roof comes down and I can't get out
I'll be in this house, so shut your mouth
When the roof comes down and I can't get out
I'll be in this house, so shut your mouth

[Chorus]
So long to the kid that I used to know
So long to the place that I used to go
I'm not an R.I.P. I'm not another sick, sad tragedy7Embed The Kid I Used to Know Sobville (Episode I) Arrested Youth alternative
