Lions roaring in the morning sun
Searching for a longer day
People feeling like the light has just come
We must never stop the way

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Birds are chirping and I hear my name
Grass is green and so alive
Life is happy, but it's so insane
We must merely make a strive

[Chorus]
Savannah, I'm coming home
Savannah, we'll never be alone
Savannah, the beauty of the world
Savannah, let's all take a whirl
Savannah

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
The lions gone and come
The birds have just begun
We will always take a stand
For the people, for the land
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let's go back to when we were young
For the animals, we stand
Let's go back to when trees were swung
Kids across the land

[Chorus]
Savannah, I'm coming home
Savannah, we'll never be alone
Savannah, the beauty of the world
Savannah, let's all take a whirl

[Drop]
Savannah, I'm coming home
Savannah, we'll never be alone
Savannah, the beauty of the world
Savannah, let's all take a whirl

[Outro]
Savannah, I'm coming home
Savannah, we'll never be alone
