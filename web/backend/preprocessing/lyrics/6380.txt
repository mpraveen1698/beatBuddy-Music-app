4 ContributorsWhatâ€™s Up Lyrics[Chorus]
You was talkin' shit bout me, now you say, "What's up?"
Text me, I won't hit reply, I'll fill up my cup
Now I'm living your dreams, I'm turnt up
I been makin' money moves and I'm goin' up

[Verse]
I'm winnin', I'm drippin', I'm ridin', no cappin'
I feel like a rockstar
And I gotta deal with these people like you
Who keep lookin' for clout
I'm winnin', I'm drippin', I'm ridin', no cappin'
'Cause, bitch, I'm a monster
And I gotta deal with these people like you
Who keep lookin' for clout

[Refrain]
Brand new crib, ice all on my wrist
Two more whips, designer on my waist
Run, run, run, boy, better run
I'm flexin' on these haters 'cause

[Chorus]
You was talkin' shit bout me, now you say, "What's up?"
Text me, I won't hit reply, I'll fill up my cup
Now I'm living your dreams, I'm turnt up
I been makin' money moves, I been goin' up
