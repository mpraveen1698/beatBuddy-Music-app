I thought about you last night
You're on repeat in my mind
Our memories on rewind
All the lows, all the highs

[Pre-Drop]
The hellos, the goodbyes
All the lows, all the highs

[Drop]
All the highs

[Verse 2]
I thought about you last night
You're on repeat in my mind
Our memories on rewind
All the lows, all the highs
I think I saw you last night
The moment I closed my eyes
Our memories on rewind
All the lows, all the highs

[Drop]

[Bridge]
