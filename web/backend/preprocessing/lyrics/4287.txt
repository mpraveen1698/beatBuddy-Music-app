4 ContributorsThose Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where have you been?
Why did you go back so soon?
You say we had more time
When I looked in those eyes
Where have you gone?
When you tell me you're so far
You say we had more time
When I looked in those eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me, so tell me
Will we both lose our minds?
So tell me, so tell me
Will we both lose our minds?

[Chorus]
Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rollin'
Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rollin'
Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rollin', rollin'
Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rollin', rollin'
