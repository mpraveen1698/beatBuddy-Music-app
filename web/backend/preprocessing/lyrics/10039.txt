I wanted someone strong who could protect me
I let his anger fester and infect me
His solution is a lie
No one here deserves to die
Except for me and the monster I created
Yeah!
Yeah!
Heads up, J.D., I'm a dead girl walking!

[ALL BUT VERONICA]
Hey, yo, Westerberg!

[VERONICA]
Can't hide from me, I'm a dead girl walking!

[ALL BUT VERONICA]
Hey, yo, Westerberg!

[VERONICA]
And there's your final bell
It's one more dance and then farewell
Cheek to cheek in hell with a dead girl walkin'!

Come on, Westerberg!

Woah oh oh oh!

[HEATHER MCNAMARA]
Here we go, here we go now!

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Veronica! Jason Dean told me you'd just committed suicide!

[VERONICA, spoken]
Yeah, well, he's wrong about a lot of things

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Oh, well, I threw together a lovely tribute, especially considering the short notice...

[VERONICA, spoken]
Ms. Fleming, what's under the gym?

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
The boiler room

[VERONICA, spoken]
That's it!
[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Veronica, what's going on?

[VERONICA]
Got no time to talk, I'm a dead girl walking!

[STUDENTS]
Hey yo, Westerberg!
Hey yo, Westerberg!
Tell me what's that sound?
Here comes Westerberg
Comin' to put you in the ground!
Go go, Westerberg!
Give a great big yell!
Westerberg will knock you out
And send you straight to hell!

[VERONICA, spoken]
Step away from the bomb

[J.D., spoken]
This little thing? I'd hardly call this a bomb. This is just to trigger the packs of thermals upstairs in the gym. Those are bombs. People are gonna see the ashes of Westerberg High School and they're gonna think 'there's a school that self-destructed not because society doesn't care but because that school was society'. The only place that Heathers and Marthas can get along is in Heaven!

[VERONICA]
I wish your mom had been a little stronger
I wish she stayed around a little longer
I wish your dad were good!
I wish grown-ups understood!
I wish we’d met before
They convinced you life is war!
I wish you'd come with me—
[J.D., spoken]
I wish I had more TNT!

[STUDENTS]
Hey yo, Westerberg!
Tell me what's that sound?
Here comes Westerberg
Comin' to put you in the ground!
Go go, Westerberg!
Give a great big yell!
Westerberg will knock you out
And send you straight to…15Embed Dead Girl Walking (Reprise) Heathers: The Musical (World Premiere Cast Recording) Barrett Wilbert Weed;Michelle Duffy;Daniel Cooney;Ryan McCartan;Elle McLemore show-tunes
