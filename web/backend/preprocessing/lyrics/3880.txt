3 Contributorsâ€‹monsters Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna hate you
Kills me that I have to
The only way that I can get some sleep alone
Tell my friends that I don't miss you
But you're friends with all my issues
I'm running out of all the ways to lie to myself

[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried turning down the monsters living in my head
Pour another drink 'til there's nothing left
Kissing other people until I forget, that I

[Chorus]
Would've loved you down to the grave
It kills me how you don't feel the same
Can't make somebody love somebody
Sometimes good things fall apart
You're in my head, it's not your fault
Can't make somebody love somebody

[Verse 2]
I guess it's kinda funny
How you can love somebody
From strangers into lovers, intro nothing at all
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried turning down the monsters living in my head
Pour another drink 'til there's nothing left
Kissing other people until I forget, that I

[Chorus]
Would've loved you down to the grave
It kills me how you don't feel the same
Can't make somebody love somebody
Sometimes good things fall apart
You're in my head, it's not your fault
Can't make somebody love somebody

[Bridge]
Heartbreak's cruel
I'm scared that I need you
All these thoughts keep on haunting me, I'm letting go tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried turning down the monsters living in my head
Pour another drink 'til there's nothing left
Kissing other people until I forget, that I

[Chorus]
Would've loved you down to the grave
It kills me how you don't feel the same
Can't make somebody love somebody
Sometimes good things fall apart
You're in my head, it's not your fault
Can't make somebody love somebodyEmbed monsters monsters Camylio songwriter
