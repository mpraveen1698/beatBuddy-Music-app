4 ContributorsMine Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know we weren't perfect
So, tell me why I keep holding on
Two kids just learning
I guess we got it wrong
'Cause look at where we are now
All this time and somehow we messed it up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that tryna erase the thought of you just doesn't work
I'm doing everything I can to numb the hurt
And all of our promises, they only make it worse
'Cause I know that now, they're only empty words

[Chorus]
Maybe one day, we'll try to work this out
I know that you don't even care right now
In a perfеct world, you'd be by my side
I hope you know that I
Will always need you еven if you're not mine

[Verse 2]
Are you with somebody new?
Holding onto forever
Doing all the things we'd do
Moving on hurts so much more 'cause I can see
I'm nothing but a faded memory, oh-oh-ooh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I know that tryna erase the thought of you just doesn't work
I'm doing everything I can to numb the hurt
And all of our promises, they only make it worse
'Cause I know that now they're just broken words

[Chorus]
Maybe one day, we'll try to work this out
I know that you don't even care right now
In a perfect world, you'd be by my side
I hope you know that I
Will always need you even if you're not mine
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-ooh

[Bridge]
I tried everything to heal our mistakes
Hurt myself just to make you stay
I said sorry when it wasn't my fault
But you still don't care at all
Don't you see what you're doing?
I don't know how you feel nothing at all
Woah-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Maybe one day, we'll try to work this out
I know that you don't even care right now
In a perfect world, you'd be by my side
I hope you know that I
Will always need you even if you're not mine
[Outro]
Even if you're not mine
I'll always need you even if you're not mineEmbed Mine Mine Keenan Te singer-songwriter
