Let me back it up to the start of the climb
Faced with an army of vipers and lions
I had to keep on reaching up 'cause it was my time
To tear down the kingdom and call out the liars
Got a jail on my heart from the pessimists
Got those nails in my mouth for impressionists
Spent too much money on a therapist
Couldn't fix me, I accepted it

[Chorus]
Gladiator, gladiator, gladiator
Picked a fight with the gods I'm the giant slayer
Boneshaker, dominator
Freight train, wrecking ball, I'm the gladiator

[Verse 2]
Tell me what it is that you think you believe
Caught in a crossfire, trouble at sea
Every single day I feel that gold underneath
I see the locked doors but I got the key
I'ma give you a second just to catch your breath
'Cause I can see that your heart is jumpin' out your chest
I know you gave it all, 'cause I've already seen your best
It is time you accepted this

Gladiator, gladiator, gladiator
Picked a fight with the gods I'm the giant slayer
Boneshaker, dominator
Freight train, wrecking ball, I'm the gladiator

[Bridge]
I've got every reason to fight
I've got every reason to fight
Have you ever shaken hands with the devil in the night?
Let me tell ya
I've got every reason to fight

[Chorus]
Gladiator, gladiator, gladiator
Picked a fight with the gods I'm the giant slayer
Bone shaker, dominator
Freight train, wrecking ball, I'm the gladiator
Gladiator, gladiator
Picked a fight with the gods I'm the giant slayer
Bone shaker, dominator
Freight train, wrecking ball, I'm the gladiator1Embed Gladiator Modern Alchemy Zayde WÃ¸lf alternative
