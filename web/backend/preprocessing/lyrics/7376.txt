3 ContributorsMarathon Lyrics[Intro: Connor Price and 4KORNERS]
Yo (yo), what's wrong with these guys, man?
(I don't even know, dog)
When will they understand this is not a short-term thing?
(Trust me)
Yo, Connor (4KORNERS of the world)
Tell 'em

[Chorus]
Yeah (woo) this a marathon, it's not a hundred metres, yeah
Play my cards right, I ain't bluffin' either, yeah
Always wear a smile like I'm Justin Bieber

[Verse 1]
Barry Bonds with the hits
I ain't never had to touch a needle, woah
But I move the needle, woah
If I do not like the song then I don't do the feature, no
Levitatin' on the beat, I call that Dua Lipa, woah
Circle tight, I do what I gotta do to keep 'еm close, yeah
Pick up the pacе, go
I keep it going no foot on the brake, woah
Ain't no one get in my lane
Just gimme the time and gimme the place
Taking a name and no one can stop me
I ain't afraid, I'm goin' in Rocky
And it's a shame they all wanna copy
But ain't no way that none can top me, look
You might also like[Chorus]
This a marathon, it's not a hundred metres
Play my cards right, I ain't bluffin' either
Always wear a smile like I'm Justin Bieber

[Bridge]
I might be here for a while, had to run the meter (woo)

[Verse 2]
Ay, I could count the people that I trust on like one hand
Always throwin' shade so ain't no way I get a suntan
This is not no movie, shootin' shots like it's Sun-dance
But nothin' come through to me the gun jammed I guess
Wait, woah
I'm the one, take notes
Sacrifice supposed to hurt, just do the work, lay low
Warmin' up, J. Cole
'Bout to blow, Waco
I've been servin' sentences behind the bars, case closed
Yeah, and I don't wait for what the verdict is
I ain't worryin'
Even if I fail, nothing's permanent
So let me spell this out for you if you ain't sure of it
Gotta turn a L into earnin', that's what learnin' is

[Chorus]
Yeah, this a marathon, it's not a hundred metres
Play my cards right, I ain't bluffin' either
Always wear a smile like I'm Justin Bieber
[Bridge]
I might be here for a while, had to run the meter

[Outro: Connor Price and 4KORNERS]
This a marathon, it's not a hundred metres
Play my cards right, I ain't bluffin' either
Always wear a smile like I'm Justin Bieber
4KORNERS with the hits, I ain't never had to-
Ah!
I told you, I mean, he told you
But I'm tellin' you now
This is a marathon, not a sprint
And you know what that means?
We goin' be here for a while
Get used to us
Shout out to the one and only Connor Price
And, uh, my name is (4KORNERS of the world)Embed Marathon Marathon Connor Price;4Korners sad
