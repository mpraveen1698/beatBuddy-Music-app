I'll light the fire
You place the flowers in the vase
That you bought today

[Verse 2]
Staring at the fire
For hours and hours while I listen to you
Play your love songs all night long

And rest your head for just five minutes
Everything is done

The windows are illuminated by the evening
Sunshine through them, fiery gems
For you, only for you

[Chorus]
Our house is a very, very, very fine house
With two cats in the yard
Life used to be so hard
Now everything is easy cause of you
And our
