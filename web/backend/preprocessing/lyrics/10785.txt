Yeah
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do
Do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do

[Verse]
Said the sun rays hitting my back
I miss the days you'd relax
It's different now, you would spaz at me for anything
I'd hover 'round, now you looking for love, but is there anything?
We're young, see the feelings are gone, until the wedding ring
I'd pick you flowers just to brighten up your day
Sunflower from the garden just to pass up on your bad mood
Tattoo on your heart, in my face from my lips
And it's all in my mind that you're saddened at this
I guess we could move over, start another life in this
It's bliss if we won it, but never overcome it
Caught time in the oven
Throw knives, I ain't ducking
You're my loving, only touching as of late
Where's the glass of champagne and the mad views
Romance is lacking
Throw hands, I'm backing up, but it's too late
Worried 'bout a date, but I'm fine though
Climbing up my mind just to escape
I love you, just wait
Hold on, just waitYou might also like1Embed Lost Love Lost Love Neb;johto sad
