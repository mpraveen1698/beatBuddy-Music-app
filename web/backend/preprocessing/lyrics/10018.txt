6 ContributorsYou & I Lyrics[Verse 1]
When we dim the lights
It's just you and I
We can spend the night
Doing whatever we want
When we're all alone
And we're in the zone
When the fear is gone
Let's do whatever we want

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna get inside your mind
Pull your body close to mine
'Cause you're all I know
Don't wanna let you go

[Chorus]
We can learn to love ourselves
We don't need nobody else
Baby, it's just you and I
There's no tеaring us apart
Dancing in each other's hearts
Baby, it's just you and I
Wе can learn to love ourselves
We don't need nobody else
Baby, it's just you and I
There's no tearing us apart
Dancing in each other's hearts
Baby, it's just you and I

You're like a part of me
I can hear you breathe
Like it's a melody
That's playing over again
You answer all my prayers
Just by being there
Follow you anywhere
And do it over again

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna get inside your mind
Pull your body close to mine
'Cause you're all I know
Don't wanna let you go

[Chorus]
We can learn to love ourselves
We don't need nobody else
Baby, it's just you and I
There's no tearing us apart
Dancing in each other's hearts
Baby, it's just you and I

[Post-Chorus]
(Baby, it's just you and I)
Baby, it's just you and I
(It's just you and I)
(It's just you and I)
(It's just you and I)
Baby, it's just you and I (It's just you and I)
[Chorus]
We can learn to love ourselves
We don't need nobody else
Baby, it's just you and I
There's no tearing us apart
Dancing in each other's hearts
Baby, it's just you and I
