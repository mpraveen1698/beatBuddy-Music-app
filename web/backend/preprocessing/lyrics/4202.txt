5 ContributorsThe Weekend (Radio Edit) Lyrics[Chorus]
I can't wait for the weekend to begin (I, I, I, I, I)

[Verse 1]
I'm workin' all week long (I, I, I, I, I)
I dream the days away
I wanna' sing my song (I, I, I, I, I)
So let the music play

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I have to get my kicks and fly tonight
And when the clock strikes 6 on Friday night (I, I, I, I, I)
I need to blow it all away (I, I, I, I, I)

[Chorus]
I can't wait for the weekend to begin (I, I, I, I, I)
I can't wait for the weekend to begin (I, I, I, I, I)

[Verse 2]
I make it, what I can (I, I, I, I, I)
I try I try
I'm shakin' up my plan (I, I, I, I, I)
And I get by

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm savin' all my soul
And all my pain
So I can lose control (I, I, I, I, I)
On Saturday
I'm gonna blow it all away (I, I, I, I, I)

[Chorus]
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I have to get my kicks and fly tonight
And when the clock strikes 6 on Friday night
I need to blow it all away
