Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

[Pre-Chorus]
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute

[Chorus]
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little about love
Aw haw

[Verse 2]
Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home

[Pre-Chorus]
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little about love
[Verse 1]
Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

[Verse 2]
Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home

[Pre-Chorus]
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute

[Chorus]
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little about love
A lot about livin' and a little about love
[Outro]
