6 ContributorsLet’s Ride LyricsI woke up today like the chieftain
Get Ziggy like it be the weekend
I leave my nuts hanging and both of them clanging
My drip from the garden of Eden
Shawty think that my dick built like ip man
Way I walk like my balls got an implants
Meditate out the bullshit, get into my zen, when I snooze, I got three head and six hands
I told em let’s ride
I woke up like yo I’m that guy
We mob with good fellas and felons, with black yellow drip like it’s rush hour 5
We deal with the bs like black jack, we placing our bets on a dime
God father like we rocking dad hats, and singing soprano, we high
Like Scarface, im writing these crack lines, they smoke em like crack pipes, Im catching a vibe
Immaculate timing, they ask when I’m back again rhyming
I’m top competition this time
And Quit the bsing, they all tryna get me to stressing, I swat off they words like a fly
I curve em like 90 degrees, boy I be burning, I radiate rizz when I rhyme
Immediate fade to black when I punch in
I know they skip to me, no assumptions
Hit em with the pen to keep up discussions
They gon talk shit, I eat up disruption
I don’t keep the peace, I do love the fuck shit
Mobbing in the streets, no nice guy or nothing
Chop em to a piece, there be repercussions
A villain when i speak, they peep the reaper comings
Cuz I make ‘em drop
Heads finna bop
Fake ones I knew, that connect getting chopped
X-ing out circles, my worlds getting cropped
The real ones that’s left, immune to photoshop
Cuz I make ‘em drop
Heads finna bop
Out of the gate, I shot straight to the top
Trails getting blazed, this is Khan’s coupe de tat
Acting like Will, I’m LL Cool J Hot
Then I told them
Let’s ride
I woke up like yo I’m that guy
We mob with good fellas and felons, with black yellow drip like it’s rush hour five
We deal with the bs like black jack, we placing our bets on a dime
God father like we rocking dad hats, and singing soprano, we high
Like Scarface, they loving my lineYou might also likeEmbed Let's Ride Let's Ride Khantrast anime
