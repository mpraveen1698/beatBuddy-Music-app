7 ContributorsDo It Better Lyrics[Intro: Zoe Wees]
Hello, bye-bye
Don't need you with me tonight
All good, all fine
My heart is all mine
No games, no lies
Put all that shit to the side

[Verse 1: Zoe Wees]
The things that I do, boy, you could never
'Cause at the end of the day, I'll do it better
The thing that I got, got it forever
Touching my dreams, I'm in the center
'Cause at the end of the day, I'll do it better

[Pre-Chorus: Zoe Wees]
I like the feeling that I feel when I'm next to you
But when I'm sleeping by myself, yeah, I see it through
From start to finish, I know I didn't come to lose
'Causе at the end of the day, I'll do it bеtter

[Chorus: Zoe Wees]
'Cause at the end of the day, I'll do it better
'Cause at the end of the day, I'll do it better
'Cause at the end of the day, I'll do it better

Thank you for showing me why
