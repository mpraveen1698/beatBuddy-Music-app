69 ContributorsBeautiful Lyrics[Chorus]
Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

[Post-Chorus]
The way that Gucci look on you, amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
Saying you the one for me, I need to face it

[Verse]
Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else that I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no

[Chorus]
Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
The way that dress fall off you is amazing
Love a miracle, a beautiful creation
Baby, come a little closer, let me taste it
You came a little closer, now you're shaking

[Bridge]
Never ever gon' mislead you
Don't believe the lies they feed you
Stop and stare like a sculpture
Painted in your colors
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
Beautiful, beautiful by my side right now, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey (No, no)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle (No, no, yeah)
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
(We know, we know, we know)
So I just had to let you know

[Post-Chorus]
The way that Gucci look on you amazing, yeah
But nothing can compare to when you're naked (Hey!)
(Perfect when you naked, together with you)
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
[Outro]
I just had to let you know
Swear to God you're beautiful, yeah57Embed Beautiful COSMIC Bazzi electro
