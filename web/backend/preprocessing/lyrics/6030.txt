7 ContributorsOn Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
See the lads been chilling in the T (Run it, run it)
Yeah, the week day dragging, the food's been slapping
The packs stay stacking, the cats keep catting
Late night grind get the money all steep (Yeah, I need that)
Yeah, the coupe broke down, gotta book me a ride
That will get me back sides, cah I'm falling off time
Gotta bell up my slime, get back to the G's (Back to the G's)
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry, but I got me no time
Late night putting in time
Late night jugging with slime
Look at this money, oh my
Check out my drip, oh my
Check out your drip, no shine
Check out your clique, no grind

[Chorus]
Look at this money, on me
All of this honey, on me
Baddie turn dummy, on me
Screaming out yummy, on me
Look at this money, on me
All of this honey, on me
Baddie turn dummy, on me
Screaming out yummy, on me

Ay, in the gaff man it's all about grinding (Grinding)
Late night when the bro's start sliding (Sliding)
Plain jane, got the Rollie no diamonds (Splash)
These times I can handle my timing
Late night got my cellie on silent
Still here tryna handle my finance, in silence
Whilst your dargs just hiding
(Yo run that again G)

[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry, but I got me no time
Late night putting in time
Late night jugging with slime
Look at this money, oh my
Check out my drip, oh my
Check out your drip, no shine
Check out your clique, no grind

[Chorus]
Look at this money, on me
All of this honey, on me
Baddie turn dummy, on me
Screaming out yummy, on me
Look at this money, on me
All of this honey, on me
Baddie turn dummy, on me
Screaming out yummy, on me
[Outro]
