Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play?
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful, and so are you
Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play?

[Verse 2]
Dear Prudence (Dear Prudence), open up your eyes
Dear Prudence (Dear Prudence), see the sunny skies
The wind is low, the birds will sing
That you are part of everything
Dear Prudence, won't you open up your eyes?

[Chorus]
Look around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Look around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Look around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Look around

[Verse 3]
Dear Prudence (Dear Prudence), let me see you smile
Dear Prudence (Dear Prudence), like a little child
The clouds will be a daisy chain
So let me see you smile again
Dear Prudence, won't you let me see you smile?

Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play?

[Bridge]
Look around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Look around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Look around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Oh, look around, look around, ah-ah-ah

[Outro]
Look around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Look around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Look around, around
Oh, look around, around
