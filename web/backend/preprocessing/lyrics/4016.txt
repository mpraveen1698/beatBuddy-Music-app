2 ContributorsOver (Sped Up) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every time we link up, it's only us there
We're thinking, will we get there?
Is it wrong? Is it right?
You know that I miss you, but I be getting mixed signals
Why you slow down? Don't stop this green light

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you calling me special
When you know I can't have you
When I'm on to the next one
Oh, now you wan' get aggressive
Ooh, fuck do you mean?
You keep on making me leave
Nightmares turned into a dream
If you're so toxic to me, what am I fiending?

[Chorus]
'Cause I thought it was over
Got me thinking my feelings over
You keep doing it over and over
You keep calling me back
I'm just tryna gеt closure
But you pulling me closer and closеr
Phone ringing, like, over and over
'Cause you keep calling me back
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Why you keep calling me back? Back?
You might also like[Verse 2]
Love me, then you switch up
I'd rather we never pick up
But can we slip up and mix up sometimes?
You say you don't mean it, just want it when it's convenient
Am I crazy for waiting? I might slide

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you calling me special
When you know I can't have you
When I'm on to the next one
Oh, now you wan' get aggressive
Oh, fuck do you mean?
You keep on making me leave
Nightmares turned into a dream
If you're so toxic to me, what am I fiending?

[Chorus]
'Cause I thought it was over
Got me thinking my feelings over
You keep doing it over and over
You keep calling me back
I'm just tryna get closure
But you pulling me closer and closer
Phone ringing, like, over and over
'Cause you keep calling me back
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Why you keep calling me back? Back?
[Bridge]
Now you walking on a thin line
We been through it, like, ten times
I'ma put you in line
Yeah, I had you on a incline
Now I don't even wanna reply
I'ma have to decline

[Outro]
(Yeah) You show me I don't wanna rewind
(Yeah) Know you a ten, but that attitude ain't fineEmbed Over - Sped Up Over (Sped Up) Lucky Daye indie
