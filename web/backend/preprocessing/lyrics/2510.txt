Out on the wily, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you, I loved you too

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad dreams in the night
They told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights

[Chorus]
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window

[Verse 2]
Ooh, it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming back, love, cruel Heathcliff
My one dream, my only master
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Too long I roam in the night
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights

[Chorus]
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window

[Bridge]
Ooh, let me have it
Let me grab your soul away
Ooh, let me have it
Let me grab your soul away
You know it's me, Cathy

[Chorus]
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
