[Verse 1]
We were at the table by the window with the view
Casting shadows, the sun was pushing through
Spoke a lot of words, I don't know if I spoke the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God, don't let me lose my mind

[Chorus]
Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look, I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life, didn't do it for you

[Verse 2]
We will come to pass, will I pass the test?
You know what they say, yeah
The wicked get no rest
You can have my heart, any place, any time

[Pre-Chorus]
Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God, don't let me lose my mind

[Chorus]
Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look, I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life, didn't do it for you

[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look, I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life, didn't do it for you
