Go!

[Verse 1]
The garden was blessed by the Gods of me and you
We headed west for to find ourselves some truth, ooh
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
We counted all our reasons, excuses that we made
We found ourselves some treasure, and threw it all away, oh
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?

[Chorus]
When I dance alone, and the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused
Blame it on me
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?

[Verse 2]
Caught in the tide of blossom, caught in the carnival
Your confidence forgotten, I see the gypsies run
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
You might also like[Chorus]
When I dance alone, and the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused
Blame it on me
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?

[Bridge]
When I dance alone, and the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control and the veil's overused
Blame it on me
When I dance alone, I know I'll go
Blame it on me, ooh
When I'll lose control, I know I'll go
Blame it on me, ooh

[Outro]
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?21Embed Blame It on Me Wanted on Voyage (Expanded Edition) George Ezra songwriter
