10 ContributorsAlone Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'd like to see you in the morning light
I'd like to feel you when it comes tonight
Now I'm here and I'm all alone
Still I know how it feels
I'm alone again

[Chorus]
Tried so hard to make you see
But I couldn't find the words
Now the tears, they fall like rain
I'm alone again without you
Alone again without you
Alone again without you
Alone again without you

[Verse 2]
I said stay, but you turned away
Tried to say that it was me
Now I'm here and I've lost my way
Now I know how it feels
I'm alone again

[Chorus]
Tried so hard to make you see
But I couldn't find the words
Now the tears, they fall like rain
I'm alone again without you
Alone again without you
Alone again without you
Alone again without you
You might also like[Chorus]
I tried so hard to make you see
But I couldn't find the words
Now the tears, they fall like rain
I'm alone again without you
Alone again without you
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again without youEmbed Alone Again Tooth and Nail Dokken hard-rock
