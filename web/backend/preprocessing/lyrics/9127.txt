Held our hands, told the time
Ooh, you and I
Is it the way you and I wait?

My only (My only)
My only you (My only)
Oh, oh

Ooh, you and I
Is it the way you and I stay?
Ooh, you and I
In my mind, you were mine, baby

[Chorus]
My only (My only)
My only you (My only)
Oh, oh

All that I'd ever see
All that I'd ever believe is through
All that I'd ever see
All that I'd ever believe is you
