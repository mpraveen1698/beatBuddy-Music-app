This mind isn't mine, who am I to judge?
Oh, I should be fine, but it's all too much

[Verse 1]
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
So just don't get overwhelmed
And you’ll make it out
Then you'll be just fine
I promise you don't have to worry bout a thing
Don't let it break you down
You got me by your side
And when you feel the difference it will be night and day
Night and day

[Bridge]
Fuck what they think
I'll tell you you're fine
When you're with me
I ain’t letting that slide
Fuck what they say
They're no friend of mine
If they keep coming
I ain't letting one by
[Verse 2]
That's the way it goes
If they ever try to touch you
Then just stay at home
That's the way it ends
I'll make sure they never see another day again
These things take time
Don't let them get to your head
You let them into your mind
Now they're under your bed
They come in easy
But is harder to get them out
So just don't get overwhelmed

[Chorus]
Mind isn't mine, who am I to judge?
(My anxiety comes too easily)
(My anxiety comes too easily)
Oh, I should be fine, but it's all too much
(My anxiety comes too easily)
(My anxiety comes too easily)
I get overwhelmed so
I should be fine, but it's all too much
(My anxiety comes too easily)
I should be fine, but I'm not
(My anxiety comes too easily)
[Chorus]
I get overwhelmed
Don't get overwhelmed
And you'll make it out
I promise you don't have to worry 'bout a thing
Don't let it break you down
You got me by your side
I get overwhelmed

[Outro]
Don't take me now
I'm not ready to forget
Don't cut me out
Pray my life's not soon to end
Don't take me now
I'm not ready to forget
Don't cut me out
