19 ContributorsAre You Ready? Lyrics[Chorus]
Yeah, I pray you don’t forget me
I can’t rush perfection, so just call me when you're ready
She ain’t sendin' screenshots girl, she talkin' 'cause she petty
Please don’t hang the phone up, you’re the only one who get me

[Verse]
Uh, are you ready for the hard times, ready for the change?
Ready for the money and the power and the fame?
Are you ready for the fake love, fake smiles, fake people actin' like they helpin' you for own personal gain?
Conversation with my shorty like I've been stressed
I've been workin' hella hard for this, I need rest
Always be careful who you tellin' all your secrets
'Cause all the wounds close range are the deepest
Yeah, I gotta hold it down, I gotta do it for the set
Shout out to my niggas treatin' women with respect
I’m seein' all the people I looked up to in the flesh, I know I’m next, and if I win, I’m finna win until the end
I see these niggas firin' they shots tryna vex me, I know they envy me
But I don’t fire shots at niggas who ain’t a threat to me
Workin' so hard all my enemies give respect to me
Matching watch pieces and they each sold separately
I don’t write fast but I write right
Yes I still connect to public Wi-Fi
And even though I walk into the store, I know the options are galore, but it’s still something that I might buy, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
She say that I’m ready, soon as you say I’m ready
And I want you to focus, but I’m scared that you’ll forget me, yeah

Yeah, I pray you don’t forget me
I can’t rush perfection so just call me when you're ready

Please don’t hang the phone up you’re the only one who get me4Embed Are You Ready? Are You Ready? Papithbk sad
