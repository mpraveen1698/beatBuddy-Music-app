6 ContributorsNVMD Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, back to where we started
Back to where we started, oh
Oh, back to when
Hey, baby

[Verse 1]
It's been 45 minutes you been blowing my phone
I mean, shit, situation is outta control
My bad, I been so fired up in here
So when the coast is clear
I'm moving far out of reach
What I got on my mind
Is that I'm hurt and you like it
This ain't chess I ain't no side piece

[Pre-Chorus]
But I bet you're too upset to even notice
I been trying hard to keep us floating
You wouldn't mind if I rewind it
This shit got me pretty honest
And I'm tired of being open
'Cause we keep on going back to where wе started
(Never mind I said I wish you'd mind)

[Chorus]
Nеver mind I said I wish you'd mind
Putting you past so we can't rewind
If I end up with you one more time
Then I guess you're my favorite crime
That's right, I'm out
But that's fine, 'cause I'm back to
Lying when I said I wish you'd mind
Putting you past so we can't rewind
You might also like[Verse 2]
Never mind I'll miss you
Before I kiss you
This song on repeat then reminisce you
I don't get the issue of being untrue, baby
When it all comes down I'm still up, waiting, wasting my breath
No, never get rest out of my impatience
Used to you, I don't know if I can repent

[Pre-Chorus]
But I bet you're too upset to even notice
I been trying hard to keep us floating
You wouldn't mind if I rewind it
This shit got me pretty honest
And I'm tired of being open
'Cause we keep on going back to where we started
(Never mind I said I wish you'd mind)

[Chorus]
Never mind I said I wish you'd mind
Putting you past so we can't rewind
If I end up with you one more time
Then I guess you're my favorite crime
That's right, I'm out
But that's fine, 'cause I'm back to
Lying when I said I wish you'd mind
Putting you past so we can't rewind
[Outro]
Oh, back to where we started
Back to where we started, oh
Oh, back to when
Never mind I said I wish you'd mind
Putting you past so we can't rewindEmbed NVMD NVMD Denise Julia chill
