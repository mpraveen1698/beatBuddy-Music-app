20 ContributorsDope On A Rope Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dope in the wash, strangers in bed
Dead-end nights make a heart beat half dead
In the mirror, striking a pose
Conjured up glamour in a school play rock show

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Guess it doesn't last forever, just a feeling to remember
Dope on a rope we hang, the catwalk’s a plank
Unless we turn around, and do it again

[Chorus 1]
Generations change
In a blink the fad's extinct
Find your lover or you'll flash the fame
Before you wake up from your dream

[Post-Chorus]
Everything changes when
When the last call lights shine
Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times
Everything changes when
When the last call lights shine
Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times

[Verse 2]
Collect taxidermy fist
Smudges on your wrists
New friends flood the list 'til you're sick
Trying to have a ball in a tagged-up stall
Numb when its from making sense of it all
I guess it doesn't last forever
Just a feeling to remember

Dope on a rope we hang, the catwalk’s a plank
Unless we turn around, and do it again
Dope on a rope we hang, this catwalk’s a plank
Unless we turn around, and do it again

[Chorus 2]
Generations change
In a blink, the fad's extinct
Find your lover or you'll flash the fame
Before you wake up from your dream

[Post-Chorus]
Everything changes when
When the last call lights shine
Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times
Everything changes when
When the last call lights shine
Seizing the heartbeat of our lovely reckless times4Embed Dope on a Rope City Club The Growlers garage
