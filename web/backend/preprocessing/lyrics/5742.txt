Father forgive me for you know that I am always sinning
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Excuse my language that’s a hang up on how shitty I been feeling
I’m sorry I feel no attraction I know that it’s been a minute

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been so alone for so long, oh-oh-oh, yeah
'Cause I've been so alone for so long, oh-oh-oh, yeah
'Cause I've been s-(hey) so long, oh-oh-oh, yeah
'Cause I've been so alone for so long, oh-oh-oh
(Just for you)

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been so alone for so long, oh-oh-oh, yeah
