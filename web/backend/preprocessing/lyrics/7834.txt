4 ContributorsRésumé Lyrics[Verse 1]
I just sorta need it
Left my heart open for readin'
You take off without knowin'
It just wasn't as potent
I fell between the seasons
You left me without leavin'
Chalk outline, yeah, I'm stallin'
I never finished grievin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I know why you been fallin'
For someone else's someone

[Chorus]
I wanna talk to you, but there's no more to say
I try to hide it, but it follows every day
No matter what I do, I'm on your résumé
I'm on your résumé
I wanna talk to you, but there's no more to say
I try to hide it, but it follows every day
No matter what I do, I'm on your résumé
I'm on your résumé

[Bridge]
We had such plans
They went so bluе, nobody didn't know
All this sin in my head
He thought "Yes," but all I did was say no
You not gonna see mе in no angry pose
I'ma always rep Southside, baby
I'm not down the block anymore, I'm ghost
This might be my last reminisce, but
You might also like[Verse 2]
I just sorta need it
But my heart is so defeated
I felt so unimportant
And you don't even know it
I fell between the seasons
You say it without meanin'
Chalk outline, yeah, I've fallen
It's still hard to believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
I know why you've been fallin'
For someone else's someone

[Chorus]
I wanna talk to you, but there's no more to say (More to say)
I try to hide it, but it follows every day
No matter what I do, I'm on your résumé
I'm on your résumé
I wanna talk to you, but there's no more to say
I try to hide it, but it follows every day
No matter what I do, I'm on your résumé
I'm on your résumé

[Outro]
