Doesn't this guitar sound so good?
Mmm, mmm, mmm
So sweet

[Chorus]
Living in this big blue world
With my head up in outer space
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
When I see trouble come my way
I be makin' lemonade
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (Mmm, mmm)

[Verse 1]
Hey, little lady, I know you're feelin' crazy (Woo)
All your other friends are busy makin' them babies (Ew)
Been out in the real world, don't like how it's tasting (Nah)
Let me change your mind with my little old saying (What?)
Two-four-six-eight, who do we appreciate? (Mmm)
Put some sugar in my water (Yuh) 'cause we makin' Minute Maid (Woo)
Fuck all the hate (Uh), do a shimmy-shake (Woah)
Throw a middle finger up down the interstate

[Chorus]
Living in this big blue world (Blue world)
With my head up in outer space (Outer space)
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (A-O-K)
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (Mmm, mmm)
When I see trouble come my way (My way)
I be makin' lemonade (Lemonade)
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (Mmm, mmm)

[Verse 2]
I'd be lyin' if I said I knew the way (Yo, I'd be lyin')
I just eat shit and pretend that it's gourmet (Yeah, I lie)
I've had terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad days
But I'm a G, can't you see that I will always be uh, uh, uh, A-O-K?

[Bridge]
Uh, uh, uh, A-O-K

We gon' be
Uh, uh, uh, A-O-K
Sugar, sugar

[Chorus]
Living in this big blue world (Blue world)
With my head up in outer space (Outer space)
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (A-O-K)
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (Mmm, mmm)
When I see trouble come my way (My way)
I be makin' lemonade (Lemonade)

I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (Mmm, mmm)
