I don't need to think about it
There's nothing in this world that we can't do
Flowers even mad about it
'Cause they can't bloom like you do
I don't see a way around it
'Cause everything has led me straight to you
It's nothing new

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm outside
Been thinkin' 'bout you all night
Been thinkin' it ain't right if you and me
Only see us in our dreams
I'm outside
Been thinkin' 'bout you all night
Been thinkin' it ain't right if you and me
Only see us in our dreams
I'm outside
Baby, I'm outside
Been thinkin' 'bout you all night
Been thinkin' it ain't right if you and me
Only see us in our dreams
I'm outside

[Verse 2]
I'll drive, you pick the station
Sunrise, no destination
No lie, I've been so patient
Like winter waiting for June
I'm done here waiting for you
Waiting for you
