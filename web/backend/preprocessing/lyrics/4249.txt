All is forgiven, baby, come on, get dressed. You're my date to the pep rally tonight!
(sung)
You chucked me out like I was trash
For that, you should be dead
But, but, but
Then it hit me like a flash
What if high school went away instead?
Those assholes are the key
They're keeping you away from me
They made you blind, messed up your mind
But I can set you free
You left me and I fell apart
I punched the wall and cried
Bam, bam, bam
Then I found you changed my heart
And set loose all that truthful shit inside
And so I built a bomb
Tonight our school is Vietnam
Let's guarantee they never see their senior prom
I was meant to be yours
We were meant to be one
Don't give up on me now
Finish what we've begun
I was meant to be yours

Pkhw, pkhw, pkhw
In the rubble of their tomb
We'll plant this note explaining why they died
[J.D. & STUDENTS, spoken]
We, the students of Westerburg High will die
Our burnt bodies may finally get through to you
Your society churns out slaves and blanks, no thanks
Signed, the Students of Westerburg High
Goodbye

[J.D.]
We'll watch the smoke pour out the doors
Bring marshmallows, we'll make s'mores
We can smile and cuddle while the fire roars

[J.D. & STUDENTS]
I was meant to be yours
We were meant to be one
I can't make it alone
Finish what we've begun
You were meant to be mine
I am all that you need
You carved open my heart
Can't just leave me to bleed
Veronica, open the— open the door, please
Veronica, open the door
Veronica, can we not fight anymore, please?
Can we not fight anymore?
Veronica, sure, you're scared, I've been there
I can set you free
Veronica, don't make me come in there
I'm gonna count to three
(spoken)
One, two, fuck it!

[STUDENTS]
Ah-ah-ah

[J.D., spoken]
Oh my God
No! Veronica!
(sung)
Please don't leave me alone
You were all I could trust
I can't do this alone

[JD & STUDENTS]
Still, I will if I must

[VERONICA'S MOM, spoken]
Veronica, I brought you a snack
Veronica?
