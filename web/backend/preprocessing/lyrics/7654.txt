(Fall, yeah)
(Fall, yeah)
So baby, won't you fall?
So baby, won't you fall?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, can't you see I'm lonely, babe?
Caught up in my own misery
And I can't even say your name
Without letting it haunt me
If I go another night
I don't know if I'll survive
You told me that you needed space
So baby, won't you fall into me?

There would be bruises
Oh, I'd risk it all
Just to get through this
And I know that I'm not perfect, baby
But I promise I'm tryin'
