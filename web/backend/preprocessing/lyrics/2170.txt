You were a phonograph, I was a kid
I sat with an ear close, just listening
Was there when the rain tapped her way down your face
You were a miracle, I was just holding your space
Hmm

[Verse 2]
Well, time has a way of throwing it all in your face
The past, she is haunted, the future is laced
Heartbreak, you know, drives a big black car
I swear I was in the back seat, just minding my own
Hmm

[Chorus]
And through the glass, the corn crows come like rain
They won't stay, they won't stay
For too long now
This could be all that we know
Of love and all

[Verse 3]
Well, you were a dancer and I was a rag
The song in my head, well, was all that I had
Hope was a letter I never could send
Well, love was a country we couldn't defend
Hmm, hmm

Through the carnival we watch them go 'round and 'round
All we knew of home was just a sunset and some clowns
Oh

[Verse 4]
Well, you were a magazine, I was a plain Jane
Just walking the sidewalks and covered in rain
Love to just get out of some of your stories
Me, all of my plain Jane glory
Just me and all of my plain Jane glory
