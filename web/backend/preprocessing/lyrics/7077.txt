3 ContributorsCan’t Come To The Phone Lyrics[Chorus: Amber Van Day]
Can't come to the phone right now
'Cause I'm high in a cab right now
Kinda busy with a new girl now

[Verse 1: Amber Van Day]
I lied to you, I lied to you, oh I must confess
I won't deny, I won't deny all the things I said
Like I'm alone, already home, the lights are off in bed
But I'm dressed up, I'm kinda messed up and I'm stayin' out instead

[Pre-Chorus: Amber Van Day]
So don't try to reach me, don't say you need me
I won't be leavin', leavin' on my own

[Chorus: Amber Van Day]
Can't come to the phone right now
'Cause I'm high in a cab right now
Kinda busy with a new girl now
In a backseat to her boyfriend's house
Can't come to the phone right now
I don't wanna hear your voicе right now
I'ma gonna let your calls ring out
Can't come to the phonе right now
'Cause I'm high in a cab right now
Kinda busy with a new girl now
In a backseat to her boyfriend's house
Can't come to the phone right now
I don't wanna hear your voice right now
I'ma gonna let your calls ring out

I could say I'll call you back, I'm on one percent
Not in a crowd, not buying rounds, not smoking cigarettes
The truth is excuses just leave you in a mess
So straight up, don't wait up 'cause I'm 'bout to lose my head

[Pre-Chorus: Amber Van Day]
So don't try to reach me, don't say you need me
I won't be leaving, leaving on my own

[Chorus: Amber Van Day]
Can't come to the phone right now
'Cause I'm high in a cab right now
Kinda busy with a new girl now
In a backseat to her boyfriend's house
Can't come to the phone right now
I don't wanna hear your voice right now
I'ma gonna let your calls ring out
Can't come to the phone right now
'Cause I'm high in a cab right now
Kinda busy with a new girl now
In a backseat to her boyfriend's house
Can't come to the phone right now
I don't wanna hear your voice right now
I'ma gonna let your calls ring out
Can't come to the phone right now
'Cause I'm high in a cab right now
Can't come to the phone right now
Can't come to the phone right now
'Cause I'm high in a cab right now
Yeah I'm high in a cab right now
Yeah I'm high in a cab right now
Can't come to the phone right now
'Cause I'm high in a cab right now
Kinda busy with a new girl now
In a backseat to her boyfriend's house
Can't come to the phone right now
I don't wanna hear your voice right now
I'ma gonna let your calls ring out, oh
Can't come to the phone right now
'Cause I'm high in a cab right now
Kinda busy with a new girl now
In a backseat to her boyfriend's house
Can't come to the phone right now
I don't wanna hear your voice right now
I'ma gonna let your calls ring out
Yeah I'm high in a cab right1Embed Can't Come To The Phone Can't Come To The Phone Martin Jensen;Amber Van Day;N.F.I electronic
