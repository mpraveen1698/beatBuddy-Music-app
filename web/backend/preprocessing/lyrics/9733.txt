13 Contributors​mr. nice guy Lyrics[Intro]
Pour my drink and take my phone away, hey, yeah
I don't wanna hear that you messed up and called him up again, hey, yeah
When you gonna see that

[Verse 1]
So, you got a couple bad friends
Only lookin' out for the drinkin', it ends yeah
Woah, it went right over my head
Maybe you should know I'm tired of playing

[Pre-Chorus]
Mr. nice guy
Catchin' your tears when you cry
Why do I try? I know it won't be the last time
You won't realize he only wants you at midnight
Can't say goodbye so I'll just listen up one more time

[Chorus]
Pour my drink and take my phone away, hey, yeah
I don't wanna hear that you messed up and called him up again, hey, yeah
When you gonna see that?
He won't never love you like you want him to, yeah
Why you wanna be somebody's number two? Yeah
Lovin' him don't mean that he in love with you, yeah
Really, I got bigger better things to do, yeah
