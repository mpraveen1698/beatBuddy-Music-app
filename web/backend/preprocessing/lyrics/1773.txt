Out on our own
Dreamin' in a world that we both know
Is out of our control
But if shit hits the fan, we're not alone

[Pre-Chorus: Ashe]
'Cause you've got me and you know
That I've got you and I know

[Chorus: Ashe]
If the tide takes California
I'm so glad I got to hold ya
And if the sky falls from Heaven above
Oh, I know I had the best time fallin' into love
We've been livin' on a fault line
And for a while, you were all mine
I've spent a lifetime givin' you my heart
I swear that I'll be yours forever, 'til forever falls apart
'Til forever falls apart

[Verse 2: FINNEAS]
So this is it, that's how it ends
I guess there's nothing more romantic than dyin' with your friends
And I'm not sorry for myself
I wouldn't want to spend a minute lovin' anybody else
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Ashe & FINNEAS]
'Cause you've got me and you know
That I've got you and I know

[Chorus: Ashe & FINNEAS]
If the tide takes California
I'm so glad I got to hold ya
And if the sky falls from Heaven above
Oh, I know I had the best time fallin' into love
We've been livin' on a fault line
And for a while, you were all mine
I've spent a lifetime givin' you my heart
I swear that I'll be yours forever, 'til forever falls apart
'Til forever falls apart

[Bridge: Ashe & FINNEAS]
We never had it from the start
'Til death do us part

[Chorus: Ashe & FINNEAS]
If the tide takes California
I'm so glad I got to know ya
And if the sky falls from Heaven above
Oh, I know I had the best time fallin' into love
We've been livin' on a fault line
And for a while, you were all mine
I've spent a lifetime givin' you my heart
I swear that I'll be yours forever, 'til forever falls apart34Embed Till Forever Falls Apart Ashlyn Ashe;FINNEAS electro
