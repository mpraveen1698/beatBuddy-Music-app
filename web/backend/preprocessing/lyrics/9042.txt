10 ContributorsHigher Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been up, I've been down
Seen the world from the ground
But I hear the drumming
Now my veins are pumping
Scraped my knees, bruised my heart
It's where you end, not where you start
I see them running
'Cause they see me coming

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm done with the noise that life seems to bring
But I'll use my voice, it's my turn to sing
Woo, woo

[Chorus]
You know that
All my life
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for this
All my life
I have been fighting, I have been fighting for this
Dream in my soul
And I won't let it go
You know that
All my life
They try to keep me down but I just get higher
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
They try to keep me down but I just get higher

[Verse 2]
Broke my bones, tasted blood
Burned my wings close to the sun
But I'll keep on flying (flying)
I'm too young for dying (dying)
'Cause there's a dream I can taste
Think it's time I break my chains
And run with the giants (giants)
Like smoke, I'm rising

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm done with the noise that life seems to bring
But I'll use my voice, it's my turn to sing
Woo, woo

[Chorus]
You know that
All my life
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for this
All my life
I have been fighting, I have been fighting for this
Dream in my soul
And I won't let it go
You know that
All my life
They try to keep me down but I just get higher
[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
They try to keep me down but I just get higher
Whoa, whoa, whoa
They try to keep me down but I just get higher

[Breakdown]
All my life
All my life
There's a dream in my soul
And I won't let it go
You know that
All my life
They try to keep me down but I just get higher

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
They try to keep me down but I just get higher
Whoa, whoa, whoa
They try to keep me down but I just get higher2Embed Higher ATLAS The Score alt-rock
