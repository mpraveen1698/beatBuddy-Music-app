5 ContributorsHeavy Soul Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hear her calling "come to me"
Thought of her won’t let me be
Go to the valley, climb the hill
Whatever it takes darlin', you know I will

[Chorus]
Hey now darlin'
Your heavy soul darlin'
Your heavy soul darlin'
Your heavy soul darlin'

[Verse 2]
Hear her calling "hurry home"
Been so long since I been gone
I won’t get tired, won’t go astray
I hear her calling, call my name

[Chorus]
Hey now darlin'
Your heavy soul darlin'
Heavy soul darlin'
Heavy soul darlin'
Heavy soul

[Verse 3]
Just my color, just my kind
Your heavy soul next to mine
Heart's on fire, get no sleep
Drive all night, no relief
