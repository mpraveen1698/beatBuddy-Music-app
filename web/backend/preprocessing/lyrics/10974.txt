I've got a feeling that I'm not alone
Love brought me here, love taught me where to go
Love is the only way I'll ever know

I've got this feeling that I can't control
I've got a feeling that I'm not alone
Love brought me here, love taught me where to go
Love is the only thing I'll never know

All I want
All I want
All I want (Ooooooh)
All I want (Ooooooh)

Is to feel like the only one in your arms
In your arms
(In your arms)
In your arms

All I want
All I want
All I want (Ooooooh)
All I want (Ooooooh)

Is to feel like the only one in your arms
In your arms
