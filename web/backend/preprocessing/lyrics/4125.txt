39 ContributorsEarth Lyrics[Verse 1]
MF, special herbs, fingers in the spice rack
A little bit of my love, sprinkled into gingerbread
I wonder, American Hunger gotta feed feds
Do bids, CO's searching under bed
MF worldwide, see no Carson Daly
I'm the original, researching like Alex Haley
All's well in Hell, listen GM Grimm's fairy tale
Get slick rewrite, script turn horror flick
But murder scene for the police, we gonna edit it
Bloody screams, violence, all seen in 3D
Loud dreams, silent screams, slash mic and vocal chords
Execute hype man, now you gotta eat alone
I pass, cause Grimm is on a fast
You're a charmer but your armor shatter like glass
Being me ain't easy, it's a difficult task
If you look through my eyes, you'll rip 'em out your head
I had fair warning about the streets, I didn't heed it
Fuck God, going to Heaven I didn't need it
Devil by nature in my heart I really knew it
Started a war up in Heaven and I blew it
Not good with taking orders, so I took the dare route
But ended up getting aired out
I give props because it was a fair bout
I give props because it was a fair bout
You might also like[Chorus]
Now I'm trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator

[Verse 2]
Perc is cursed, you hear it in his verses
Voodoo doll, sticking pins in an iPod
Pulling strings in industry, watching puppets dance
Niggas I burnt, watch 'em turn to the man
Time flies when alive, quickly turn OG
But niggas still can't fuck with me
I don't tour, so when you see me you see me
No radio and I'm never on the TV
Still get dough, music's a drug, I move weight
Mad is the flow so wack niggas hate
My heart got cold but my mind spit heat
The world's on my shoulder but I'm not on my feet
Chariots of fire, gunshots from the wheelchair
Nigga I'll leave you there
Emcees are counterfeit, three dollar bill shit
Some have gimmicks, others you just feel shit
All in they lyrics, others be bullshit
You know what, fuck them (Yeah fuck them man)
I'm tired of talking about these niggas
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
[Chorus]
Now I'm trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator

[Verse 3]
Time gap, three years, better do your homework
Not a stranger to murder, seen many niggas die
Exterminate my life, so many tried
Black Nikes, white stripe, drink grape Kool-Aid
To be an MF, you're donned by me
MF Grimm, real name Percy
C-E-O, last name Carey
My boys are the white noise, my crew is scary
Day By Day Distribution got it on the smash
Those who challenge get knocked on they ass
Grab niggas with my mind, across the room get flung
Mastered styles of Wing Chun with tongue
You can be the best, I'm trying to feed my family
Plus I'm paranoid, please don't fuck with me
I'll kill you, straight up, this is reality
This ain't a made up urban documentary
I thank the creator for the woman who was sent to me
My life, my legs, didn't know what they meant to me
Until I had to lose them both and regain them
Spirits all around me I try to explain to 'em
Go ahead and put the chorus back
[Chorus]
Now I'm trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator2Embed Ecuador - Original Radio Edit It's My Life Sash! techno
