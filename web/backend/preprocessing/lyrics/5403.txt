I got a lot to say to you
Yeah, I got a lot to say
I noticed your eyes are always glued to me
Keeping them here and it makes no sense at all

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies

[Pre-Chorus 2: Hayley Williams & Josh Farro]
Crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
(Two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone
Just the one two of us who's counting on
That never happens
I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than
This

If you wanna play it like a game
Well, come on, come on, let's play
'Cause I'd rather waste my life pretending
Than have to forget you for one whole minute

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies

[Pre-Chorus 2: Hayley Williams & Josh Farro]
Crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
(Two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone
Just the one two of us who's counting on
That never happens
I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than
This now
[Bridge: Hayley Williams, Josh Farro, Zac Farro, Jeremy Davis & Bekah Sheets]
Rock and roll, baby
Don't you know that we're all alone now?
I need something to sing about
Rock and roll, hey (Hey)
Don't you know, baby, we're all alone now?
I need something to sing about
Rock and roll, hey (Hey)
Don't you know, baby, we're all alone now?
Give me something to sing about

[Chorus]
Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone
Just the one two of us who's counting on
That never happens
I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than, no-ooh-oh
Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone
Just the one two of us who's counting on
That never happens
I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than
