28 ContributorsNot Good Enough For Truth In Cliche Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hurtful words from my enemies of the last five years
What's it like to die alone?
And how does it feel when tears freeze when you cry?
The blood in your veins is twenty below

[Chorus]
Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet
Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget
Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet
Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget
Something I cannot forget

[Verse 2]
So for now, take this down a notch
Crash my car through your window
Make sure you're still alive
Just in time to kill you

[Chorus]
Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet
Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget
Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet
Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget
Something I cannot forget

(I can't take this take anymore)
(I can't take this take anymore)
I cannot feel what you've done to me
(I can't take this take anymore)
What you've done to me

[Pre-Chrous]
So for now, take this down a notch
Crash my car through your window (window)

[Chorus]
Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet
Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget
Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet
Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget
Something I cannot forget19Embed Not Good Enough For Truth In Clich√© Dying Is Your Latest Fashion Escape the Fate metalcore
