4 ContributorsOn My Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm fallin', losing my focus
How come you're actin' like you haven't noticed?
I'm going crazy, stuck with your maybe
Left me in nowhere, my beautiful nightmare

[Pre-Chorus]
My love, when I look into your eyes
Girl, it gets me every time
And I thought that you should know (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
That I got you on my mind, on my mind, on my mind
I want you all the time, all the time, every night
Tell me you feel it too, you don't have to play it cool
'Cause I got you on my mind, on my mind, on my mind

[Verse 2]
Cool as a cold war, hot like a fever
I'm tryna hold on 'cause, baby, I need ya
You're so contagious, tell me I'll make it
Act like you don't know, I'm caught in your limbo

[Pre-Chorus]
My love, when I look into your eyes
Girl, it gets me every time
And I thought that you should know (Oh, oh, oh)
You might also like[Chorus]
That I got you on my mind, on my mind, on my mind
I want you all the time, all the time, every night
Tell me you feel it too, you don't have to play it cool
'Cause I got you on my mind, on my mind, on my mind

[Bridge]
Come on, baby, get closer, I wanna hold ya
Think of you all the time
I'm counting the days that I have to wait for
You to make up your mind, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
My love, when I look into your eyes
Girl, it gets me every time
And I thought that you should know (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
(Hey) That I got you on my mind, on my mind, on my mind
I want you all the time, all the time, every night (Ooh, every night)
Tell me you feel it too, you don't have to play it cool (Na-na-na)
'Cause I got you on my mind, on my mind, on my mind

[Outro]
On my mind, on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
On my mind, on my mindEmbed On My Mind Ripples Maximillian songwriter
