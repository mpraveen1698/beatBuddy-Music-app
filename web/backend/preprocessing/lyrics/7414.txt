You know you could call me?
If you’re ever lonely
Ooh, I’ll be there if you need someone to listen to you talk
So if you’re lonely
You can call me

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone by hope you’re doing fine (Doing fine)
Haven’t talked in a while since we last broke up (Last broke up)
I’ve been trying to move on but, but it don’t feel right
Oh, another days gone by hope you’re doing fine (Doing fine)

[Pre-Chorus]
All I’m trying to say is that I’m here
If you ever need someone to hear
'Causе I know that it’s never easy (Woah, oh-oh, ah)
Takе me like a simple remedy
When your feeling down or feel in need
Just remember, oh
Just remember

[Chorus]
You know you could call me? (You know you could call me)
If you’re ever lonely (If you're ever lonely)
Ooh, I’ll be there if you need someone to listen to you talk
So if you’re lonely (If you're lonely)

I’m reminiscing bout the things we said
Our memories be playin' in my head
Still feels like it was yesterday (Yesterday)
But then we drifted far apart
With no reason why
If it’s meant to be (That’s alright)
That’s okay with me (Oh, na-na-na-na-na)

[Pre-Chorus]
But all I’m trying to say is that I’m here
If you ever need someone to hear
'Cause I know that it’s never easy (Woah, oh-oh, ah)
Take me like a simple remedy
When your feeling down or feel in need
Just remember, oh
Just remember

If you’re ever lonely
Ooh, I’ll be there if you need someone to listen to you talk
So if you’re lonely (If you're lonely)
