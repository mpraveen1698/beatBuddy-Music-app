7 ContributorsLead me on Lyrics[Chorus]
She like to lead me on
She never show me off
This that don't tell anybody that we talk
I say I'll play along, but girl give me a shot
When they bring me up, you say that you forgot

[Verse 1]
She said let's keep it lowkey
Act like you don't know me
Anytime her friends around, she treat me like a homie
And I could never take her out, we stay at home
Say I wanna date around, she's saying no
But she can have another guy, she got like five
Say thеy're like her brothеr, right
Know that's a lie
Quiet like a lullaby
Keep it undercover, right
But I just wanna sing so loud

[Chorus]
She like to lead me on
She never show me off
This that don't tell anybody that we talk
I say I'll play along, but girl give me a shot
When they bring me up, you say that you forgot
You might also like[Verse 2]
She said let's keep it lowkey
But who am I hiding from?
Girl I've been tossing, turning, hurting, and I'm tired of
All the fake things we do
And I hate being used
If I stay then I lose all my pride
But I wanna take a pic with you, a trip with you, and show you the sun
This feel like middle school
I'm kissing you but holding my tongue
I feel invisible, but if I say a little more
Then she might call it quits, I'd still be missing what I'm wishing for

[Chorus]
She like to lead me on
She never show me off
This that don't tell anybody that we talk
I say I'll play along, but girl give me a shot
When they bring me up, you say that you forgot
She like to lead me on
She never show me off
This that don't tell anybody that we talk
I say I'll play along, but girl give me a shot
When they bring me up, you say that you forgot

[Bridge]
But why am I wastin' my time?
I can't say that you're mine
All my friends say I'm blind and it's true
Try to open my eyes
I might go, no I lied
If I leave you behind then I lose
[Chorus]
She like to lead me on
She never show me off
This that don't tell anybody that we talk
I say I'll play along, but girl give me a shot
When they bring me up, you say that you forgotEmbed lead me on lead me on sammy rash songwriter
