I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I was dreaming while I drove the long straight road ahead, Uh-huh, yeah
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you was just burning me up inside

[Chorus]
I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night

[Verse 2]
What in this world
Keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go I hear
The beating of our one heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I think about you when the night is cold and dark, uh-huh, yeah
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you
Oh
You might also like[Chorus]
I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night

[Pre-Chorus]
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you was just burning me up inside

[Chorus]
I drove all night to get to you (All night)
Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room (All right)
Is that all right?
I drove all night
I drove all night to get to you (All night)
Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room (All right)Embed I Drove All Night The Essential Roy Orbison Roy Orbison rockabilly
