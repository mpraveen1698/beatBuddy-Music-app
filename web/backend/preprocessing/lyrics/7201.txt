I've been on track, 20 racks on 20 bitches
Bet she won't stay, triple stack on all her visions
Let her hold back, pussy stains on all my britches
I've been on track, 20 racks on 20 bitches
I've been on track, 20 racks on 20 bitches
Bet she won't stay, triple stack on all her visions
Let her hold back, pussy stains on all my britches
I've been on track, 20 racks on 20 bitches

[Chorus]
Twine, twine, twine racks on me
Twi-i-ine racks on me
Twine racks, racks on me
Oh well mane, let 'em fall down
Get the bitch on a picture
And click what a bitch on the pic
Right, right, right
Twine racksYou might also like24Embed Idk How to Kill Myself Idk How to Kill Myself Yunggoth✰ emo
