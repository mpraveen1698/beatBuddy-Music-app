8 ContributorsInner Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
Standing tired on your feet
Lightest head just like me
You wanna dance, I wanna lead
A sleight of the hand that you never see

[Chorus]
You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes, just follow the inner light (You count on me)

[Post-Chorus]
You count on me
You count on me

[Verse 2]
I can fly, I can breathe
And learn to sing like do-re-mi
So you wanna dance and you wanna be
A bat out of hell, follow my lead

[Chorus]
You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes, just follow the inner light (You count on me)
You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes, just follow the inner light (You count on me)

So follow me to our old life
Falling deeper into the light
Into the light

[Verse 3]
You wanna dance, I wanna lead
A sleight of the hand that you never see

[Chorus]
You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes, just follow the inner light (You count on me)
You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes, just follow the inner light (You count on me)

[Post-Chorus]
You count on me
