1 ContributorRoses Are Red (Violets Are Blue) Lyrics[Chorus]
Roses are red, violets are blue
I don't sleep at night 'cause I'm thinking of you
Alone with my thoughts, trapped in this bed
Know I'd give the world just to see you again

[Verse 1]
I'll believe it when I see it
'Cause you said you're moving on
Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it
'Cause we both know you're not that strong

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause slamming doors and crying out
I thought it'd get you back 'til now

[Chorus]
Roses are red, violets are blue
I don't sleep at night 'cause I'm thinking of you
Alone with my thoughts, trapped in this bed
Know I'd give the world just to see you again

[Post-Chorus]
And your imperfections perfectly drawn up
But I was a fool to think you were in love
So roses are red, violets are blue
It's all in my head, no matter what I do
You might also like[Verse 2]
It seems you've lost your love for me
Even though just two weeks ago you were happy
It seems you've lost your sympathy
But I guess it's my fault 'cause I let you slip from me

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't believe you'd ever leave me
So please just listen to me now

[Chorus]
Roses are red, violets are blue
I don't sleep at night 'cause I'm thinking of you
Alone with my thoughts, trapped in this bed
Know I'd give the world just to see you again

[Post-Chorus]
And your imperfections perfectly drawn up
But I was a fool to think you were in love
So roses are red, violets are blue
It's all in my head, no matter what I do

[Outro]
So roses are red, violets are blue
It's all in my head, no matter what I doEmbed Roses Are Red (Violets Are Blue) Roses Are Red Jon Caryl sad
