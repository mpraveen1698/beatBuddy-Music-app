I still look at you with eyes that want you
When you move, you make my oceans move too
If I hear my name, I will run your way
Can we say that we love each other?
Can we play like there ain't no other?
If I hear my name, I will run your way

[Chorus]
It's my desire that you feed
You know just what I need
You got power, power
You got power over me
I give my all now, can't you see
(If you're ready now, if you're ready now)
Why won't you set me free?
(If you're ready now, if you're ready now)
You got power, power
(If you're ready now, if you're ready now)
You got power over me
(If you're ready now)

[Verse 2]
I was lost until I found me in you
I saw a side of me that I was scared to
But now I hear my name and I'm running your way
All I feel as I get closer to you
Is the desire to move like you do
So now I hear my name and I'm running your way
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
(If you're ready now, if you're ready now)
(If you're ready now) I am ready now (If you're ready now)
(If you're ready now, if you're ready now)
(If you're ready now, if you're ready now)

[Chorus]
It's my desire that you feed
You know just what I need
You got power (Power), power (Power)
You got power over me
I give my all now, can't you see
Why won't you set me free?
You got power (Power), power (Power)
You got power over me

[Outro]
(Ready now) You're the one that seduced me
(Ready now) Lured me in with your beauty
(Ready now) Now I know that you used me
I'm ready now, I'm ready now
(Ready now) All you did was confuse me
(Ready now) You're no longer what I need
(Ready now) Touch me slow, feel my heart bleed
I'm ready now, I'm ready now9Embed Power Power Isak Danielson songwriter
