1 ContributorFlower LyricsDon′t wind me up
Don't wind me up

The touch of yours
It′s what I've been lookin' for
When you say my name
I just wanna feel you more

I tried to read your book
But it′s too complicated
And I can′t know how you feel
Damn I hate it

Don't wind me up
Oh God, I′m scared, oh
Don't wind me up
Oh God, I′m scared, oh
Don't wind me up
Oh God, I′m scared, oh
Don't wind me up
Oh God, I'm scared, oh

Don′t wind me up
Oh God, I′m scared, oh
Don't wind me up
Oh God, I′m scared, oh
Don't wind me up
Oh God, I′m scared, oh
Don't wind me up
Oh God, I′m scared, oh
