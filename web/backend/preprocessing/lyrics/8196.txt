1 ContributorSweather Weather Lyrics[Verse]
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand

Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Build up / Pre drop]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

Get ready to bounce!
GO!

[Drop]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
You might also like'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And all I am is a man

Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

GO!
