6 ContributorsChange Lyrics[Chorus]
I got my brothers right or wrong, and that's regardless
It's DTB, can't trust no one because I'm heartless
It's my life I'll do what I want to hit my targets
I'll cut you off cah I stopped giving second chances
I can't believe I let you make a fool of me
Can’t believe I let you make a fool of me
It's clear to see some people never change, change, change

[Verse 1]
Look, I ain't got no ex, only a person who fumbled the bag
I ain't got time for a chick that chats
And I don't need love man, I need more racks
She wants a man like Durk or Von
Have some shame like your mum
Emily don't know about love like TLC, I don't take no scrubs
Look, I tried Evelyn, Leesha, Ella and Misha, none of them took me in
She saw the glow up and now she wanna roll in expensive whips
No, they can't hold this dick
Cah you would of stayed down if life weren't lit
I gotta flex, but I block out the haters
I'm in a double r, with the window tints
Play real, don't pretend, you threw me in the deep end
She said take me off her subs, like, oh she want to be friends
Fully in motion, please don't get lost in the moment
Remember how my hearts so frozen
I don't know how to show my emotions
You might also like[Chorus]
I got my brothers right or wrong, and that's regardless
It's DTB, can't trust no one because I'm heartless
It's my life I'll do what I want to hit my targets
I'll cut you off cah I stopped giving second chances
I can't believe I let you make a fool of me
Can’t believe I let you make a fool of me
It's clear to see some people never change, change, change

[Verse 2]
I can't believe I let you make a fool of me
You broke my heart said we won't last
And then you blamed it all on me
Like how's that fair, bare man shelling off, I need true love, it’s rare
If you wasted time on someone
Putting his hands up in the air, I told bro come of the road
But he'd rather score more goals like Salah
And I'm cold with the pen like Xhaka
I rap on beats and it makes me Bala
It's 4am and I just can't sleep and that's cus' I can't find peace
So I grabbed me a pen and I wrote me a track
Cah that's a word to my bro, JBee
No, you can't use me, I don't use word bro loosely
If I got you, I can't lose, my minds inside out like Toosii
Where you wanna go, let me know
Can't leave without a coat that's cah the streets too cold
My hearts on froze, it's you that I want
Like no, says he wanna roll, let's go
[Chorus]
I got my brothers right or wrong, and that's regardless
It's DTB, can't trust no one because I'm heartless
It's my life I'll do what I want to hit my targets
I'll cut you off cah I stopped giving second chances
I can't believe I let you make a fool of me
Can’t believe I let you make a fool of me
It's clear to see some people never change, change, change
