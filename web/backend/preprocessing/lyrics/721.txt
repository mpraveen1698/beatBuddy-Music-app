If you bring the lighting, Then I got that Thunder Sound, An’

If she's vegetarian I cucumber her down, Way

Harder then M.J. On a Play Ground, Woah


I spit sweet bars, Call it Wonka

Bitch I never play around, Tonka

Go ahead and talk shit then ima bonk ya'

Maybe someday is this World that Ima conquer


Im spittin’ Venom, These other rappers forget em'

They come around and I end em'

And hit em' with my momentum Ah'


The mechanism
You might also likeThe stopping the communism

This poppin' up out the prism

This pottin' the raw the system. Hah!


I gotta lotta heart like King Kong

She playin' with my balls like ping-pong

I feed her my Dick like a Ding-Dong

Playin’ With them titties in the cities like bing-bong


It seems apparent that starin’ im incoherent

Transparent when people glarin'

Not caring’ my musics blarin' And'


I devour

The people begin to cower
The rifle up on the tower

Thats fired at every hour, Woah!


Somehow I never seem to give a Fuck

Got ahead and talk shit, I can't get enough

Throw your fist up, If you’re feelin' tough

Skinny young man through hands, like im hella buff


You chippin' from the rough, for the sandtrap

Im sittin' on the green fareway or the stairway, To

Heaven, Led Zeplin

Play it backwards, Its the password to get your ass hurt



So, Are you a bastard?
Sittin' at your local bar gettin' platered

Too fucked up, and you act a hazard

Remastered, Got your ass walkin' backwards



Please. You need to stay calm

I know I spit heat like a fucking napalm

Get to rowdy and you get a face palm. Wait

I dont give a Fuck cause im so, wait, GONE



Ive been drinkin too much liquor

Now my belly's getting sicker

Need find a girl to dick her dick her down. Dick her down

Pick her up and Dick her down

Make her world go round when I go down town. Pound



Pound on down them ovaries

Ain't nobody over me

Stickin through these women like im diggin through my groceries

Lets have a toast to me

Heres to what im supposed to be

Heres to when i hit it and remember who was close to me



Think before you say it with your mouth

Back when all I used to do was stay up in my house

Back when not a single so would care what im about

This is what i am about so keep my name up out your mouthEmbed Stairway to Heaven - Remaster Led Zeppelin IV (Deluxe Edition) Led Zeppelin hard-rock
