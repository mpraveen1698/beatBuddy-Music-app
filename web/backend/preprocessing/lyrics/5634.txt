Late at night I could hear the crying
I hear it all trying to fall asleep
When all the love around you is dying

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save?

[Chorus]
A fallen angel in the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel

[Verse 2]
You do it all for my own protection
You make me feel like I'll be okay
Still I have so many questions

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save?
You might also like[Chorus]
A fallen angel in the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel, just let go
You don't have to be alone
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight

[Bridge]
I was right beside you when you went to hell and back again
I was right beside you when you went to hell and back again
And I, I couldn't save a fallen angel

[Chorus]
A fallen angel in the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel, just let go
You don't have to be alone
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
