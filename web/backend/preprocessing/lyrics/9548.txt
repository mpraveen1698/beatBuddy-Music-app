Call me unreliable
Throw in undependable too

Do my foolish alibies
Bother you
Well I'm not too clever
I just adore you

Call me unpredictable
Tell me I'm inpractical
Rainbows I'm inclined to pursue

Call me irresponsible
Yes I'm unreliable
But it's undeniably true
That I'm irresponsibly mad for you

Go on and call me unpredictable
Tell me that I'm impractical
Rainbows I'm inclined to pursue

You go ahead call me irresponsible
I admit I'm unreliable
But it is undeniably true
