You should have told me
I don't know what to say
Why are you sorry?
How did it get this way?
My heart is broken
Down to my core
It's not what I wanted
I don't know what I want anymore

[Chorus]
I'm afraid that band-aids
Are no good for heartache
Not okay, so tell me
When your world is fallin' down

[Verse 2]
Afraid of fallin' down
But fire has started right behind me
And if I don't jump now
I fear that I can't take the burning
I can't hear a sound
Nothin' that I say can hurt me
Dive into the ground
I fear that I can't take the burning
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm afraid that band-aids (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
Are no good for heartache (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
Not okay, so tell me (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
When your world is fallin' down (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)

[Bridge]
Friends of flowers
Fragile silence
Stand beside you
Stop your cryin'

[Chorus]
I'm afraid that band-aids (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
(Friends of flowers)
Are no good for heartache (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
(Fragile silence)
Not okay, so tell me (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
(Stand beside you)
When your world is fallin' down (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
(Stop your cryin')10Embed bandaids bandaids keshi chill
