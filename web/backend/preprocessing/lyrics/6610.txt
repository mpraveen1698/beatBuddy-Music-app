13 ContributorsSlow Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm on my second guess
Or maybe my second best
What do I have to do
To know that I'm getting through?
I don't have much to say
Just hoping you'd come my way
What do I have to do
To come and get close to you?
(Come get close to you)

[Chorus]
Baby, I won't slow down
And I won't say when
Tell me why I be comin' 'round again
I'm ready to go again
Baby, I won't slow down
And I won't say no
Just one look and I think it's time to show
I think that I already know

[Verse 2]
Colorin' in the greys
I see your every shade
I'm running back around
To tell you I hold you down
I could say everything
Pulling me by the string
What do I have to do?
Tell me what you want to do
(Tell me what you want to do)

Baby, I won't slow down
And I won't say when
Tell me why I be comin' 'round again
I'm ready to go again (Ready to go)
Baby, I won't slow down
And I won't say no
Just one look and I think it's time to show
I think that I already know
Baby, I won't slow down
And I won't say when
Tell me why I be comin' 'round again
I'm ready to go again (Ready to go)
Baby, I won't slow down
And I won't say no
Just one look and I think it's time to show
I think that I already know4Embed Slow Down Drive Slow Mac Ayres chill
