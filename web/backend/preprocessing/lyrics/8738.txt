(Go, oh, go)
Why'd you let me let you go?

[Verse 1]
Bullets in the dark
Shootin' through my hesitating heart
We were never gonna go far
'Cause I'm no good at loving someone as good as you
Look what I put you through
I know I can't undo this
I'm black and blue to tell the truth

[Chorus]
It's breakin' me, I'm not just losin' you
I'm losin' what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you

[Drop]
Go, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?

[Verse 2]
Wish you made me stay
Wish you didn't let me run away
Guess you knew that I would never change
'Cause I'm no good at lying to someone as good as you
Look what I put you through
I know I can't undo this
I'm black and blue to tell the truth
You might also like[Chorus]
It's breaking me, I'm not just losin' you
I'm losin' what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you

[Drop]
Go, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?

[Bridge]
I tried, I tried to love you
I swear I tried
But how can I love you if you're not here?
I tried, I tried to love you
I swear I tried
I tried, I tried to love

[Chorus]
It's breakin' me, I'm not just losin' you
I'm losin' what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you
[Drop]
Go, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?
Go, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?
