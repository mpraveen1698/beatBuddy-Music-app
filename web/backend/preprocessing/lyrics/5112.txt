What the fuck's up, Dre?

[Dr. Dre]
You tell me, you talk to Ren

[MC Ren]
I'm right here nigga
Release the hound

[Snoop Dogg]
Bow wow wow

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
I'm a nigga wit an attitude thanks to y'all
And I don't give a fuck I keep it gangsta, y'all
I'ma ride for my side in the CPT
God bless the memory of Eazy-E
If it wasn't for me, where the fuck you'd be?
Rapping like the Treacherous Three, you fucking cowards
I done seen Dre rocking parties for hours
And I done seen Ren fucking bitches from Howard
And I done seen Snoop give away a Eddie Bauer
So fuck Jerry Heller and the white superpowers

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
This the shit niggas kill for
They hear the villain niggas spitting with them nigga flows
Fuck you hoes, fuck you bitch-ass niggas too
Got something for your throat
These niggas wearing skirts like the Pope
Who them niggas that you love to get
Who them niggas that you fuckin' with
Love to yell that we the shit
The saga continues with the world's most dangerous group
Four deep in the Coupe

I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke (Fuck that)
I'ma choke who I wanna choke (Fuck that)
I'ma ride where I wanna ride (Fuck that)
'Cause I'm a nigga for life, so I'm a nigga 'til I diz-ie
I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke (Fuck that)
I'ma choke who I wanna choke (Fuck that)
I'ma ride where I wanna ride (Fuck that)
'Cause I'm a nigga for life, so I'm a nigga 'til I diz-ie
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
A pencil, a pen, or a Glock
I'm the original, subliminal, subterranean
Titanium, criminal minded, swift
D-R-E with that fuck a bitch shit
A couple of notes and get you hog-tied in rope
Dope like tons of coke, cut-throat
You don't want the pistols to whistle
Candy paint Impala
I make hoes pop collars

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Goddamn hoes, here we go again
Fucking with Ren, playing to win
He got the Coke and Hen - I got the juice and gin
Same shit you was fucking with way back then
We keep it crackin' from the actin' to the jackin'
G'd up, C'd up, motherfucker blaze the weed up
We all on deck fool so put your heat up
I stay on deck so me don't get wet
[Ice Cube]
Look my nigga, we can scatter like buckshots
Let's get together, make a record, why the fuck not
[MC Ren]
Why the fuck not

[Dr. Dre]
Why the fuck not

[Snoop Dogg]
Why the fuck not

[Ice Cube]
'Cause I'm tight as the night
I had to wipe activator off the mic, in 1985

[Snoop Dogg]
Real niggas, biatch, you know, ha ha

[Ice Cube]
We cause tragedy, erratically
Systematically in your house without a key
How fucked up that'd be
Gat'll be near your anatomy, my form of flattery
[Dr. Dre]
Assault and battery
'Cause we coming with that street mentality
Straight West Coast rider academy
Concrete nigga, that's my reality

[Snoop Dogg]
We tend to bust on niggas that get mad at me

[Dr. Dre]
Was it a bitch in the mix

[Snoop Dogg]
Well it had to be

[Dr. Dre & (MC Ren)]
Lying tricks told them dicks I had a key
Hoes make the world harder than it have to be (Yeah, that's right)

[Refrain: Snoop Dogg & (NWA)]
I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke (Fuck that)
I'ma choke who I wanna choke (Fuck that)
I'ma ride where I wanna ride (Fuck that)
'Cause I'm a nigga for life, so I'm a nigga 'til I diz-ie
I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke (Fuck that)
I'ma choke who I wanna choke (Fuck that)
I'ma ride where I wanna ride (Fuck that)
