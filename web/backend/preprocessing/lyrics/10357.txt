1 ContributorDon’t Call Me Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
6 A.M., cold again
Tossing around while you're in his bed
Mmm, yeah
Heard he's a simple guy
Got two Lambs' and they off white
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know why I tried
Finding myself in you
Stupid thing to do
Hope he treats you right
But when he treats you wrong
You're drunk and all alone

[Chorus]
Don't call me
Ooh
Don't call me
Ooh
When you wake up at 3
I'm where you want to be
Don't call me
Ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Don't call me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, 5 P.M., Melly drive
Ten-piece card tryin' to kill the time, ooh
I see everyone tryna cop a wine
He's at work trying to blur thе line, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know why I tried
Finding myself in you
Stupid thing to do
Hopе he treats you right
But when he treats you wrong
You're drunk and all alone

[Chorus]
Don't call me
Ooh
Don't call me
Ooh
When you wake up at 3
I'm where you want to be
Don't call me
Ooh
Don't call me
[Drop]

[Post-Chorus]
Don't call me
Ooh
Don't call me
Ooh
Don't call me
Ooh
Don't call me
Ooh
