People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

[Chorus]
When you're strange, faces come out of the rain
When you're strange, no one remembers your name
When you're strange, when you're strange
When you're strange

[Verse 2]
People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
When you're strange, faces come out of the rain
When you're strange, no one remembers your name
When you're strange, when you're strange
When you're strange
Alright, yeah
