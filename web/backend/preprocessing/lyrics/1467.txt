46 ContributorsOut of Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I won't tell you I'm lonely
'Cause it may be selfish
I won't ask you to hold me
'Cause that won't mend what's helpless

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a thing I could say
Not a song I could sing for your mind to change
Nothing can fill up the space
Won't ask you to stay
But let me ask you one thing

[Chorus 1]
Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love?
Oh, when did you fall out of love with me?

[Verse 2]
I can't float in an ocean
That's already been drained
I won't cry at your feet now
I know my tears will fall in vain

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a thing I could say
Not a song I could sing for your mind to change
Nothing can fill up the space
Won't ask you to stay
But let me ask you one thing
You might also like[Chorus 1]
Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love?
Oh, when did you fall out of love with me?

[Bridge]
No use wondering
Why your change in heart has wandered
So I'll ask you this question
'Cause it might help me sleep longer

[Chorus 2]
Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love?
Oh, when did you run out of love for me?

[Outro]
Out of love (Out of love)
Out of love (Out of love)
Out of love with me25Embed Out Of Love The Pains Of Growing Alessia Cara electro
