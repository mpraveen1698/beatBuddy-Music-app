Gotta raise a little hell

[Verse 1]
Young blood, run like a river
Young blood, never get chained
Young blood, heaven need a sinner
You can't raise hell with a saint
Young blood, came to start a riot
Don't care what your old man say
Young blood, heaven hate a sinner
But we're gonna raise hell anyway
Raise hell, raise hell
Somebody gotta, gotta raise a little hell

[Chorus]
Baby, drop them bones
Baby, sell that soul
Heaven, fare thee well
Somebody gotta, gotta raise a little hell
(Oh, my my, oh, hell yeah)
Somebody gotta, gotta raise a little hell
(Oh, my my, oh, hell yeah)
Somebody gotta, gotta raise a little hell

[Verse 2]
Young blood, stand and deliver
No need for a queen of air
Young gun, gotta pull the trigger
When the whole world running scared
Raise hell
