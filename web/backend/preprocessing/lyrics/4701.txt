18 Contributors18 Lyrics[Verse 1]
18, crazy, pulled up in your daddy's car
You want to, move in with me
Guess we're off to a heavy start
Should have seen this coming
From a mile away

[Bridge]
18, crazy, I know what you want from me
I know what you want from me

[Chorus]
So if you wanna piss off your parents
Date me to scare them, show them you're all grown up
If long hair and tattoos are what attract you
Baby, then you're in luck
And I know it's just a phase, you're not in love with me
You wanna piss off your parents, baby
Piss off your parents, that's alright with me

[Verse 2]
You know I'm broke, so you pulled out your daddy's card
I drink, I smoke, you ate it up from the very start
Should've seen this coming, from a mile away

[Bridge]
I'll play your game, I know what you want from me
I know what you want from me
You might also like[Chorus]
So if you wanna piss off your parents
Date me to scare them, show them you're all grown up
If long hair and tattoos are what attract you
Baby, then you're in luck
And I know it's just a phase, you're not in love with me
You wanna piss off your parents, baby
Piss off your parents, that's alright with me

[Bridge]
I know what you want from me

[Chorus]
So if you wanna piss off your parents
Date me to scare them, show them you're all grown up
If long hair and tattoos are what attract you
Baby, then you're in luck
And I know it's just a phase, you're not in love with me
And I know it's just a phase, you're not in love with me
You wanna piss off your parents, baby
Piss off your parents, that's alright
You wanna piss off your parents, baby
Piss off your parents, that's alright with me10Embed 18 Burnout (Deluxe Version) Anarbor punk
