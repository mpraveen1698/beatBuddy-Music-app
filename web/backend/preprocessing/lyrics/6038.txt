Is it right or wrong
Try to find a place
We can all belong?
Be as one
Try to get on by
If we unify?
We should really try...

[Pre-Chorus]
All this time
Spinning round and round
Made the same mistakes
That we've always found
Surely now
We could move along
Make a better world?
No it can't be wrong

[Chorus]
Let's come together
Right now
Oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Time is running out
Let there be no doubt
We should sort things out
If we care
Like we say we do
Not just empty words
For a week or two

[Pre-Chorus]
Make the world
Your priority
Try to live your life
Ecologically
Play a part
In a greater scheme
Try to live the dream
On a wider scene
