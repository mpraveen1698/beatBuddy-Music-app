5 ContributorsBy Your Side (Oliver Heldens Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you wake up in the morning
And you're shadowed by the darkness of the night
When you wake up in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side
When you get a little lonely
And you lose your rhythm, don't give up the fight
When you wake up in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side (I'll be by your side)

[Chorus]
I'll be by your side
(I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side)
I'll be by your side
(I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side, I'll be by your side)
I'll be by your side (Whoa)
I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side

[Verse 2]
When you wake up in the morning
And you're shadowed by the darkness of the night
When you wake up in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side
When you get a little lonely
And you lose your rhythm, don't give up the fight
When you wake up in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side (I'll be by your side)

So lift your hand 'cause you know that you got love
There'll fire again in the dark
Hold out your hand, let the stars sing again
Let the light shine in through the dark
And I'll be there
