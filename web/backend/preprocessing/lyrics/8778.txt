[Verse: Jimmy Levy]
Now I put the blade down, darling
I wanna see the light of the mornin'
I was stuck inside the yesterdays
Sedative ease the pain on my wrist
I put the blade down, darling, oh
I stood in the dark wishin' the end was near
Now I found my heart, and I know I have worth here

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION, Jimmy Levy & Both]
So I won't let go, oh
I wanna grow old, old
I won't let go, oh
I won't let, I won't let
I won't let go, oh
I wanna grow old, old
I won't let go, oh
I won't let, I won't letYou might also like21Embed wanna grow old (i won't let go) Bad Vibes Forever XXXTENTACION;Jimmy Levy emo
