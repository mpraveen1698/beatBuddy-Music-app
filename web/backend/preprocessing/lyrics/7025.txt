7 ContributorsFight For Something Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1: Max P]
Every time you try this
You try a little harder
You push a little further
You give a little more of yourself
And every now and then you might even stumble, but fall it keeps you humble
Remember to be proud of yourself

[Pre-Chorus: Max P]
I've been walking a road that’s less traveled
And I want you to do just the same
Let mysteries unravel, though it can be a hassle
When life is winning battles, you will find your way and it's okay

[Chorus 1: Max P]
You gotta fight sometime
Show you stand for something
Make the wrong things right
It's now or never
It’s all or nothing
You gotta love this life
Like you don't care for what's coming
You gotta fight sometime with all you've got when you fight for something
...
You gotta fight sometime with all you've got when you fight for something

Now seize the moment it's here for you. (x2)

[Chorus 2: Max P]
You gotta love this life
Like you don't care for what's coming
You gotta fight sometime with all you’ve got when you fight for something
...
You gotta fight sometime with all you’ve got when you fight for something

[Chorus 3: Max P]
