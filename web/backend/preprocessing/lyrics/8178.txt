7 ContributorsBurning Hour Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see you burning in the fire, the best I’ve ever seen, you're caught up in your dreams
I know you wanna take it right, you're falling like a queen, you're dressed just like a movie
Oh and I waited for a sign, I waited for a sign, I waited for this only
Oh but you kept me in the dark, you waited at the park, you know I was your lover

[Chorus]
Take another breath, you're out of time
Body in the flame burning in the fire
And I don’t need to dance with nobody
You can say you’ll make it up to me
Make another bed for another life
Best you ever had, wanna make it right
So I don’t need to dance with nobody
Promise me you’ll make it up to me

[Verse 2]
I wanna set myself alight, you're burning through the night but nothing ever goes right
I want to take you to the core, and watch you as I fall, yeah, watch you in the starlight
Oh and I waited for the sign, I waited for the sign, I waited for the right time
Oh but you kept me in the dark, you waited at the park, you know I was your lover

[Chorus]
Take another breath, you're out of time
Body in the flame burning in the fire
And I don’t need to dance with nobody
You can say you’ll make it up to me
Make another bed for another life
Best you ever had, wanna make it right
So I don’t need to dance with nobody
Promise me you’ll make it up to me
You might also likePromise me you’ll make it up to me
Promise me you’ll make it up to me

Promise me you'll make it up to me3Embed Burning Hour Hyper Romance Jadu Heart soul
