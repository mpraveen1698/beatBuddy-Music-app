7 ContributorsDopamine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Put my life on the line
It's the only way I'll ever feel alive
Kissed the rose, love is blind
I don't care about the thorns if you're my type, ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me wide awake
When you keep livin' in my mind
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Start that beat again
I need you night and day
'Cause only you can get me high
Heartbeat, heartbeat

[Chorus]
You make all the dopa-dopamine in my bloodstream
The way you touch me, I'm lovin' the feeling
Of dopa-dopamine in my bloodstream
Let it control me, I'm lovin' thе feeling

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Ooh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Ooh), that dopamine (Yeah)
Start that beat again
