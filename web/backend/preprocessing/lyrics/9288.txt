2 ContributorsWithout a Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stay a while
Maybe I will find the words to say this time
I'm an honest man, will try and speak my mind
It's hard to find your way without a light

[Verse 2]
When we drink wine
You have a way to slow the motion in my mind
All the while, can turn me back to you in mid-flight
It's hard to find your way without a light

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, what's the point in livin' out my days without you?

[Verse 3]
Towards the sky
Look to find the sign to tell me where to fly
The birds that soar above don't need a reason why
It's hard to find your way without a light

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, what's the point in livin' out my days without you?

Ooh-ooh, what's the point in livin' out my days without you?Embed Without a Light Without a Light Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors acoustic
