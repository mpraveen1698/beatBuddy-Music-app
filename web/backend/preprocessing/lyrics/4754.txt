12 ContributorsRound & Round Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I seen a bad lil jawn with a cute lil figure
I might just hit her (hmm)
True say man I heard she's nuts but she came all sweet
That's something like Snickers
I might slide to the rave, dip quick with a couple odd guys
That's something like pick up (skrr, skrr)
Drink slow or the liq' might hit, nah, you won't feel sick
But you might get hiccups (ah)
See the packs that we got hit core so you might hit floor
Like your doing up sit-ups
Cross board like you doing up chess
But we still hit goals no ball no kick-ups (never)
If your guy wanna talk off the gums
Cause he's making up crumbs then he might get flick up (flick)
Got food over here on mans table
Fix your face and posture, sit up
I was out on my grind last night (last night)
Pain upon both my shoulders
Had no friends tryna back on site (who's there)
Magic up in my shoes when I did 10 toes
Man, I flew like Mike (wash)
I ain't tryna say I'm an astronaut
But I'm tryna tell you that I'm fly (fly)
Long story short I'm the best man here
So why would you pick that guy? (why?)
Cah you think he's thug? (oh yeah?)
Check out my flex, man I shine
But I still look rough because I came out the mud
Stil-Still made sure that my team had love
I was in church tryna get blessed up
When your man left town tryna sell gyal love
I was OT just tryna get paid
When your man stayed home tryna get some love

[Verse 2]
You think I was finished?
Had to make bread out of town overseas
How could you think that I'd stay home chilling?
Gotta kill games on something like villain
Br-Bro wanna say that my flex come dead
When I saw mans check, man, I thought I'd bill him
Shown man a check of the date, just watch
When the price came cropped, man I knew that hit him
[Chorus]
