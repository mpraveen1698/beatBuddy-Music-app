14 ContributorsLove Affair Lyrics[Verse 1]
You and I, baby
Maybe we can ride away, baby
And I just wanna get inside, baby
But I don't wanna wait forever
Scared that I can't treat you better than her

[Pre-Chorus]
So when I'm gonna know what to feel inside, baby?
Maybe it's just all in my head, so

[Chorus]
Don’t overthink, this is love
Maybe it's just a crush
Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair?
I hope what I feel is enough
Maybe this is just lust
Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? Yeah

[Verse 2]
I wanna know
I wanna know how to feel, what to feel, what's right
I never know
'Cause when it gets real, I just run away and hide from you
From you
From you, ooh, ooh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So when I'm gonna know what to feel inside, baby?
Maybe it's just all in my head, so

[Chorus]
Don't overthink, this is love
Maybe it’s just a crush
Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair?
I hope what I feel is enough
Maybe this is just lust
Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? Yeah

[Bridge]
And I just want a good time
But am I wrong for that? No
Am I wrong for that? No, no, yeah
And is it not the right time?
But what's the wrong in that, oh?
Am I wrong for that? No, no, so

[Chorus]
Don't overthink, this is love
Maybe it’s just a crush
Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair?
I hope what I feel is enough
Maybe this is just lust
Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? Yeah17Embed Love Affair Love Language UMI soul
