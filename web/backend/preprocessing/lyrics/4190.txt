20 ContributorsGhostride Lyrics[Verse 1]
Daydreaming, I stay in the backseat
The slow beat rocks me back to sleep, keeps me on automatic
Pressed my face up close against the glass I see the people
When they pass they move so automatic
You wake up when I go down
The radio reminds me I'm alive
We've been hearing it all night

[Chorus]
Come on now, don't let this go
Don't let my love fade away
People come and people go, but I

[Verse 2]
Lazy day, I'm so hungry
You melt me like a candle and a flame
But something is pulling you away
We've been stuck out here so long
My phone rings and reminds me I'm alive
And I'm feeling kinda high

[Chorus]
Come on now, don't let this go
Don't let my love fade away
People come and people go, but I
