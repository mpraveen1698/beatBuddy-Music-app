Been afraid of what could happen
Do I dare to let you go?
'Cause to me you're like a habit
You are all I ever known

[Chorus]
But if I ruled the world for just one day, I would
Gather all my feelings that remain for ya
Hide 'em in the ocean far away, 'cause I've
Tried to let you go, but I'm scared of what it feels like
But if I ruled the world for just one day, I would
Gather all my feelings that remain for ya
But if I ruled the world for just one day, I would
I would, I would, I would, I would

[Drop]
If I ruled the world for just one day, I would
Gather all my feelings that remain for ya
If I ruled the world for just one day, I would
Tried to let you go, but I'm scared of what it feels like
If I ruled the world for just one day, I would
Gather all my feelings that remain for ya
Hide 'em in the ocean far away, 'cause I've
Tried to let you go but I'm scared of what it feels like

'Cause I thought you'd be the last
But there's more to love than hurt, right?
We could do better than that

[Chorus]
But if I ruled the world for just one day, I would
Gather all my feelings that remain for ya
Hide 'em in the ocean far away, 'cause I've
Tried to let you go but I'm scared of what it feels like
If I ruled the world for just one day, I would
Gather all my feelings that remain for ya
But if I ruled the world for just one day, I would
I would, I would, I would, I would

If I ruled the world for just one day, I would
Gather all my feelings that remain for ya
If I ruled the world for just one day, I would
Tried to let you go, but I'm scared of what it feels like
If I ruled the world for just one day, I would
Gather all my feelings that remain for ya
Hide 'em in the ocean far away, 'cause I've
Tried to let you go but I'm scared of what it feels like
