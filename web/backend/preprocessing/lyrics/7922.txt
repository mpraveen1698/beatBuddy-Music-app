1 ContributorYou’ll Be Alright Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's such a pretty day
It feels like yesterday
That we could spend
Some time outside, yeah
But we should stay inside
So things don't get out of line (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know it'll soon be over
And I know that things just won't be the same
So we just gotta wait a little patiently (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I'll write you a letter (Ooh)
I'll sing you a song
I'll make things much better
Everything will be fine
And I promise that you'll be alright

[Verse 2]
I've been spending too much time in my room
Killin' time, workin' 9 to 5
And I often feel no energy
How I miss your company
Maybe we can meet in a zoom (What?)
Or FacеTime, anything that you want to
Just hit me up and I'll be thеre for you (I'll be there for you)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know it'll soon be over
And I know that things just won't be the same
So we just gotta wait a little patiently (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I'll write you a letter (Ooh)
I'll sing you a song (Sing you a song)
I'll make things much better
Everything will be fine
And I promise that you'll be alright (I'll be there for you)
(You)
(Ooh)
(I'll be there for you, ooh)2Embed You'll Be Alright You'll Be Alright Milky Day;frad;Hayne chill
