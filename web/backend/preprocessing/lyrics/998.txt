You ought to know that I think we're one and the same
I don't think we could help it, no, I don't think we could help it
We don't talk much, guess 'cause nothing has changed
And I'm not sure I like it, and I'm so tired of fighting

[Chorus]
If I told you, you'd know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I would anyways, we'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you could say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same, there's worse things I can take

[Verse 2]
I know you hate it when there's nothing to say
I'm not quite sure wе'd fix it, guess we're so usеd to it
Wish I had known this from the beginning
We'd find it hard to work out, why we have all this doubt

[Chorus]
If I told you, you'd know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I would anyways, we'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you could say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same, there's worse things I can takeYou might also like8Embed the perfect pair Beatopia beabadoobee indie-pop
