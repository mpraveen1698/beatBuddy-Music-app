16 ContributorsPrey Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got an axe to grind, a crooked mind
You better watch your back
I got an axe to grind, a crooked mind
You better watch your back
Starved like a vampire chasing a vein
Cruel disposition, sickness I crave
Attention, attention, welcome to the stage
Your new sacrifice, come sharpen your teeth

[Chorus]
Prey, we are all prey for the sorrow
Prey, we are all prey for the sorrow, our sorrow
Prey, prey, we're prey for the sorrow
Prey, prey, prey for the sorrow

[Verse 2]
I got an axe to grind, a crooked mind
You better watch your back
I got an axe to grind, a crooked mind
You better watch your back
Sick validation, gut full of pills
Self-medication, it's making me ill
Attention, attention, it's all eyes on me
I'll burn at the stake while you ache for the kill

Prey, we are all prey for the sorrow
Prey, we are all prey for the sorrow, our sorrow
Prey for the sorrow, our sorrow
Prey, prey, we're prey for the sorrow
Prey, prey, prey for the sorrow

[Bridge]
Our new gods are empty like the holes in our heads
We dance upon the altar of envy and hubris
A scourge of narcissism reaps depression in black waves
If this is your salvation, you better pray
You better pray
You better pray
One, two, three, go

[Chorus]
Prey, we are all prey for the sorrow
Prey, we are all prey for the sorrow, our sorrow
Prey, prey, prey for the sorrow
Prey, prey, prey for the sorrow1Embed Prey Reverence Parkway Drive metalcore
