I just don't care
What you've done in your life
And I'll fly with you

I still believe in your eyes

I just don't care
What you've done in your life

Baby I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waitin' too long
Please come by
And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with youYou might also like1Embed L'amour toujours (feat. Delaney Jane) - Tiësto Edit L'amour toujours (feat. Delaney Jane) [Tiësto Edit] Dzeko & Torres;Delaney Jane;Tiësto progressive-house
