38 ContributorsAlways Lyrics[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands, they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you, all night, always

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
And I'll miss your laugh, your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you tell me
I'm so sick of fights, I hate them
Let's start this again, for real

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?

Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you, all night, always
Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you, all night, always

[Bridge: Tom DeLonge]
I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you, all night, always
Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you, all night, always

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
