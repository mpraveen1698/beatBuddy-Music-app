31 ContributorsThe Mystic Lyrics[Verse 1]
Got a head full of spiders
And a heart that isn't here
In a room full of lighters
All my demons reappear

[Pre-Chorus]
Broken cigarettes and bullet holes
One more to the chest and I'm alone
Nothing gets me any higher
And nothing ever will

[Chorus]
Tried to stay sober, tried to stay clean
Wake me when it's over, like a bad dream
Mama doesn't call, sister never writes
Bet you they would laugh if I called to say goodbye
No one's gonna worry, notice when I'm gone
They won't know I'm missin'
'Til they pull me out the Mystic (Oh)

[Verse 2]
I bet nobody can remember
What color eyes are on my face
I'm a freak, I'm a pretender
I never really had a place
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Broken cigarettes and bullet holes
One more to the chest 'til I'm alone
Nothing gets me any higher
And nothin' ever will

[Chorus]
Tried to stay sober, tried to stay clean
Wake me when it's over, like a bad dream
Mama doesn't call, sister never writes
Bet you they would laugh if I called to say goodbye
No one's gonna worry, notice when I'm gone
They won't know I'm missin'
'Til they pull me out the Mystic (Oh)

[Bridge]
Tell the preacher not to pray
There's no angels where I go
Only pieces that I broke and
Scattered dreams across the floor
I'm home

[Chorus]
Tried to stay sober, tried to stay clean
Wake me when it's over, like a bad dream
Mama doesn't call, sister never writes
Bet you they would laugh if I called to say goodbye
No one's gonna worry, notice when I'm gone
They won't know I'm missin'
'Til they pull me out the Mystic (Oh)
Tried to stay sober, tried to stay clean
Wake me when it's over, like a bad dream
Mama doesn't call, sister never writes
Bet you they would laugh if I called to say goodbye
No one's gonna worry, notice when I'm gone
They won't know I'm missin'
'Til they pull me out the Mystic (Oh)13Embed The Mystic The Mystic Adam Jensen alternative
