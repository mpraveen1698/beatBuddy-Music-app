You paint a picture in my mind
You want to leave it all behind
In a world that's turning all the time
Nothing could stop me longing for your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't let it die
I can feel you when you're not around
When the night gets cold
I won't, I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't
I won't be alone
We won't be alone

[Chorus]
We won't, we won't
We won't, we won't
We won't, we won't
We won't be alone
We won't be alone

[Verse 2]
This lake of fire burns my skin
How could love wear so thin?
I'm sinking in the hollow ground
Nothing can stop me wanting you somehow
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I won't let it die
I can feel you when you're not around
When the night gets cold
I won't, I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't
I won't be alone
We won't be alone

[Chorus]
We won't, we won't
We won't, we won't
We won't be alone
We won't, we won't
We won't, we won't
We won't be alone
We won't be alone

[Outro]
I won't let it die
I can feel you when you're not around
When the night gets cold
We won't be alone4Embed We Won't Be Alone We Won't Be Alone Feint;Laura Brehm dub
