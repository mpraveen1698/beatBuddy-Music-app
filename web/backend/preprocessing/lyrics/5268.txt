Don't put up a front with me
Is this really how you want it to be?
I know you're lookin' for excuses to make other plans
When he's not around to hold your hand
And all the times that you called me
Crying on the phone
Please don't sell yourself short
'Cause you're scared of being alone
I don't wanna see you hurt anymore
No, I don't wanna see you hurt anymore

[Chorus: demxntia]
It kills me
Every time that we speak
I know that you wanna be free
But you're trapped in your memories
Yeah, it kills me
Ohh baby, it ain't hard to see
You're happier when you're with me
You're happier when you're with me

[Verse 2: keshi]
Take my hand, I need your attention
Fuck your man, I’ll teach him a lesson
If we speak in bodies, we can’t tell nobody
Fuck you when you lonely, nah
But I know she say that I am not enough (I'm not enough)
In my heart, I know that I am not enough

But you're trapped in your memories
Yeah, it kills me
Ohh baby, it ain't hard to see
You're happier when you're with me
You're happier when you're with me
