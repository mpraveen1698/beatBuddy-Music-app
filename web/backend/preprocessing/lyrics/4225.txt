[Verse 3: Blxst & Fireboy DML]
Can nobody do your body like me?
She said, "Well, you should come remind me
You know exactly where to find me"
But I'd been lookin', lookin' for you
Pick up the phone, the least you can do (Sheesh)
Might be there in a weekend or two
Wanna dive deep in with you like, whoa?
So can you come show me?
Can you come show me
Everything that you told me?
You said you want me
You not the only one tryna control me
I been wantin' you so bad (Peru, para)
That you might make me backtrack (Peru, para)
Might just fly away (Peru, para)
Just touched down from MIA (MIA)
[Verse 4: 21 Savage & Fireboy DML]
When you see me, I'm on go mode
To the rap game and I put it in a chokehold (21)
Hit it from the back, I'm goin' loco
Twenty million dollars in a year and that's with no-shows (21, peru, para)
Say she love me, but I'm deaf, yeah, so so (Facts, peru, para)
She got a thing for Chanel, I call her CoCo (No cap, peru, para)
I wanna see you wine, get on all fours (Peru, para)
Lace front, but she like her beats Afro (21)
Always lookin' fine, how you do that? (How you do that? 21)
Walk past, ass fat, I'm like "Who that?" (I'm like "who that?")
Iâ€™m with the gang, they keep askin' where your crew at (21, 21)
She like, "They on the way, you should already knew that"
Yeah, you talkin', let me see if you can back it up (Peru, para)
Ridin' in a SF90 and I'm actin' up (On God, peru, para)
I like starin' at the money while it's stackin' up (21, peru, para)
Don't pay attention to the haters, they just actin' tough (21, peru, para)

[Pre-Chorus: Fireboy DML]
Won ni won wa mi, woni wo n wa mi

Won ni won wa mi, woni wo n wa mi
