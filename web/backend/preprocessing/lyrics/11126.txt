Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun, do, dun, do, do
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Here comes the sun, do, dun, do, do
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, the smile's returning to their faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun, do, dun, do, do
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Here comes the sun, do, dun, do, do
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all rightYou might also likeEmbed Here Comes The Sun Here Comes The Sun Viva La Panda deep-house
