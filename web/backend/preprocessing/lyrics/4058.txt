6 ContributorsTurning Page Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've waited a hundred years
And I'd wait a million more for you
Nothing prepared me for
What the privilege of being yours would do

[Chorus]
If I had only felt the warmth within your touch
If I had only seen how you smile when you blush
Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough
Well, I would have known what I've been living for all along
What I've been living for

[Verse 2]
Your love is my turning page
Where only the sweetest words remain
Every kiss is a cursive line
Every touch is a redefined phrase

[Chorus]
I surrender who I've been for who you are
Nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours
Well, I would have known what I've been living for all along
What I've been living for
You might also like[Verse 3]
Though we're tethered to the story we must tell
When I saw you, well, I knew we'd tell it well
With a whisper, we will tame the vicious seas
Like a feather bringing kingdoms to their knees1Embed Turning Page Turning Page Sydney Rose songwriter
