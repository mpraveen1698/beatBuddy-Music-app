If you wanna hang out
You've got to take her out
Cocaine
If you wanna get down
Down on the ground
Cocaine

[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

[Verse 2]
If you've got bad news
You wanna kick them blues
Cocaine
When your day is done
And you wanna run
Cocaine

[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

If your day is gone
And you wanna ride on
Cocaine
Don't forget this fact
You can't get it back
Cocaine

[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
