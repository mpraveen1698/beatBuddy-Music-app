1 ContributorYou Are My Sunshine LyricsThe other night, dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamt I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You never know, dear, how much I love you
Please, don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me and love another
You'll regret it all someday

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You never know, dear, how much I love you
Please, don't take my sunshine away

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You never know, dear, how much I love you
Please, don't take my sunshine away
Please, don't take my sunshine away
No, please, don't take my sunshine awayYou might also likeEmbed You Are My Sunshine Covering the World, Vol. 3 Music Travel Love country
