6 ContributorsThe Trouble with Wanting Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wandering soul
Wandering mind
Wondering what’s gone wrong with me
And try not to try
Swayed by the wind
Swayed by desire
Can’t reach the moon up above
And I don’t dare touch the fire

[Chorus]
'Cause the trouble with wanting is I want you
The trouble with wanting is I want you
The trouble with wanting is I want you
And I want you all the time

[Verse 2]
Always on my mind
Always alone
You could be miles and miles away
But somehow you're close
If I can't have my cake
And I can't eat it too
Well, I guess the sound of your voice
In the aching will just have to do
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause the trouble with wanting is I want you
The trouble with wanting is I want you
The trouble with wanting is I want you
And I want you all the time

[Bridge]
And if you never come back
If you never call
I say I'll understand when I don’t at all

[Chorus]
'Cause the trouble with wanting is I want you
The trouble with wanting is I want you
The trouble with wanting is I want you
And I want you all the time
The trouble with wanting is I want you
The trouble with wanting is I want you
I see you there and I see that line
(The trouble with wanting is I want you)
And I want you all the time
Oh, I want you all the timeEmbed The Trouble with Wanting Front Porch Joy Williams acoustic
