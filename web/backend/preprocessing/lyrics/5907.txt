11 ContributorsPIGEONS Lyrics[Verse 1]
I used to run around naked chasing pigeons
Get home, orange squash, television
Never got it that I grew up being British
James Bond's next mission, the Queen gets my digits
Doing drugs not enough so I quit it
Text my old school friends, "Let me hit it"
Said she down, so I'm cooking in the kitchen
Exams? Think I'll miss it, I fucked my revision

[Chorus]
I take ya way back home
The sun don't shine, so the moon won't glow
Everybody 'round me who's confused won't know
Why I'm always sleeping or I'm rude, and so
I still feel low
Come back home
The sun don't shine, so the moon won't glow
Take a little picturе, polaroid I hope
I never havе to pay back the things I owe
The things I owe

[Verse 2]
Let's take it back to 2003
Where the sky was still blue and the grass was still green
Now the kids being rude through the cracks on my screen
So we say something true, thinking fast on our feet
Tell the girls with their makeup it's past Halloween
Grab the car, get on road, fill it up, gasoline
Fifty K on the watch, trying to track calories
Got a text from my ex, but she left me on seen (Aw)

I take ya way back home
The sun don't shine, so the moon won't glow
Everybody 'round me who's confused won't know
Why I'm always sleeping or I'm rude, and so
I still feel low
Come back home
The sun don't shine, so the moon won't glow
Take a little picture, polaroid I hope
I never have to pay back the things I owe
The things I owe5Embed PIGEONS Digikid 2 Yxngxr1 sad
