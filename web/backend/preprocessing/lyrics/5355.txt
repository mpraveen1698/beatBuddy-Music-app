5 ContributorsI Finally Found Someone Lyrics[Verse 1: Barbra Streisand, Bryan Adams & Both]
I finally found someone
Who knocks me off my feet
I finally found the one
Who makes me feel complete
It started over coffee
We started out as friends
It's funny how from simple things
The best things begin
This time is different la la la la
It's all because of you la la la la
It's better than it's ever been
'Cause we can talk it through
My favorite line
Was "Can I call you sometime?"
It's all you had to say
To take my breath away

[Chorus: Both, Barbra Streisand, Bryan Adams]
This is it
Oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
'Cause whatever I do it's just got to be you
My life has just begun, I finally found someone
Ooooh, someone
I finally found someone
Ooooh

Did I keep you waiting? I didn't mind
I apologize Baby, that's fine
I would wait forever
Just to know you were mine
You know, I love your hair Are you sure it looks right?
I love what you wear Isn't it too tight?
You're exceptional
I can't wait for the rest of my life

[Chorus: Both, Barbra Streisand, Bryan Adams]
This is it
Ohhhhh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
'Cause whatever I do It's just got to be you, Oh yeah
My life has just begun, I finally found someone

[Outro: Barbra Streisand, Bryan Adams & Both]
And whatever I do
It's just got to be you
Oooh my life has just begun
