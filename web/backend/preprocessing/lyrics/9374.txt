[Verse 1: Ashley Alisha]
Wake up to the sun on my face
Map out my day
Try my best to stay awake
Need me some coffee
Open up my windows and breathe
Everybody's doin' the same thing
It's always been like that, yeah, I know it

[Pre-Chorus: Ashley Alisha]
Then the days flew by without me countin' 'em
Suddenly I've made my way around the sun

[Chorus: Ashley Alisha & nobody likes you pat, nobody likes you pat]
Spring is on my mind
This cold don't feel right
Need you by my side, baby (Baby)
Today's turns into night
Don't wanna waste our time
Please keep me warm, alright, baby? (Baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Ashley Alisha]
One day I met somebody special
Not to get all sentimental
But he has a way of makin' me forgеt outside of us
Don't know where this is gonna еnd up
He might not even be the right one
But I like him
Think I wanna get to know him
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Ashley Alisha, nobody likes you pat]
When we’re together days go by, stopped countin 'em (Stopped countin 'em)
Hand in hand we’ll make our way around the sun

[Chorus: Ashley Alisha & nobody likes you pat, nobody likes you pat]
Spring is on my mind
This cold don't feel right
Need you by my side, baby (Baby)
Today's turns into night
Don't wanna waste our time
Please keep me warm, alright, baby? (Baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Ashley Alisha]
Seasons go changin'
I guess, so am I
Lately I’m thinkin' if time's on my side
People around me are hardly the same (Hardly the same)
Hope I'm not too far behind

[Chorus: Ashley Alisha & nobody likes you pat, nobody likes you pat, Ashley Alisha]
Spring is on my mind
This cold don't feel right (Don't feel right)
Need you by my side, baby (Baby)
Todays turns into night
Don't wanna waste our time
Please keep me warm, alright, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed Winter blossom Spring in Winter Dept;Ashley Alisha;nobody likes you pat chill
