I'll be honest, I'm alright with me
Sunday mornings, in my own bedsheets
I've been waking up alone, I haven't thought of her for days
I'll be honest, it's better off this way

[Pre-Chorus: Niall Horan]
But every time I think that I can get you out my head
You never ever let me forget, 'cause

[Chorus: Niall Horan & Anne-Marie]
Just when I think you're gone, hear our song on the radio
Just like that, takes me back to the places we used to go
And I've been tryin' but I just can't fight it
When I hear it I just can't stop smiling
I remembеr you're gone, baby, it's just the song on thе radio
That we used to know

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
I'll be honest, I'm alright with me
Sunday mornings, in my own white tee
I've been waking up alone, I haven't thought of him for days
I'll be honest, ha, it's better off this way

[Pre-Chorus: Niall Horan & Anne-Marie]
Every time I think that I can get you out my head
You never ever let me forget, 'cause
