15 ContributorsMinimum Lyrics[Verse 1]
How do I word this verse?
So much work at first, it goes
How should I word this verse?
So much worse the further, the further you go

[Chorus]
Go, take off a load
Letting your wings unfold
And keeping everything down to a minimum
Everything a bit low
Tell 'em what you know
Not all that you know, though
The truth be told you need it more than you thought
But you're managing, that's how you evened out, out

[Verse 2]
Keep on walking that line, the fine line
Between the wrong and the right
You get yours, I'm gonna get mine
Is that what you signed for?
They're feeding you lines
To keep you on their side
It works every time

[Bridge]
What you got to live for?
Now you got the whole of the world at your feet
And how much more can you pass yourself 'round?
What you got to live for?
Now you got the whole of the world at your feet
But you're still shaking
You need to make up some ground
