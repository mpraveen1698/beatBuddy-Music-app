2 ContributorsFavourite Things Lyrics[Verse 1]
It’s crazy that
That time flies when we’re with somebody that we love 
I know we had
Our differences when we, just started out our love

[Pre-Chorus]
There is nobody else that understands me 
That understands the way I’m feeling deep inside
Yea there’s so many things I love about us
I love about us
Yea I think you know 

[Chorus]
My favourite things about us
Is when we talk till the a.m
We’d be looking up dream apartments
In cities we never heard of 
My favourite things about us
Is when we argue and make up
I never thought we would make it, till this far (Woah oh)

[Verse 2]
When I wake up, right next to you I don’t
Feel like I’m lost anymore
Never enough, oh when it comes to you
Give you my best and my all 
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
There is nobody else that understands me
That understands the way I’m feeling deep inside
Yea there’s so many things I love about us
I love about us
Yea I think you know 

[Chorus]
My favourite things about us
Is when we talk till the a.m
We’d be looking up dream apartments
In cities we never heard of 
My favourite things about us
Is when we argue and make up
I never thought we would make it, till this far 

My favourite things about us
Is when we talk till the a.m
We’d be looking up dream apartments
In cities we never heard of 
My favourite things about us
Is when we argue and make up
I never thought we would make it, till this far (Woah oh)

[Outro]
Yea my favourite, (Yea, uh) my favourite 
Yea my favourite things 1Embed Favourite Things Favourite Things Rangga Jones chill
