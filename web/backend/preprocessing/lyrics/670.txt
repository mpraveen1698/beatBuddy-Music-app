1 ContributorGive It To Me (Full Vocal Mix) Lyrics[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
See us in the club
See us in the club
See us in the club
See us in the club
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
When Timbo' is in the party, everybody put up they hands
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple gra-a-and
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respectеd from Californ-I-A way down to Japan
I'm a real producer, and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts — I hеard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling? I don't think you came in clear
When you're sittin' on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here
Now I saw you tryna act cute on TV, "Just let me clear the air..." (Air, air, air, air, air, air)
We missed—

[Outro: Nelly Furtado & Justin Timberlake]
