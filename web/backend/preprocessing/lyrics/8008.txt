Said I'm alright
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right
Said I'm alright
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right

[Verse 1]
Remember when we sayin' all the same shit
Wish upon the stars that we made it
Got too scared and didn't go
Want so bad, I went alone
Pray so hard for the make up
All the time spent couldn't save us
Got too scared and didn't go
Want so bad, I went alone

[Chorus]
Said I'm alright
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right
Said I'm alright (Ayy!)
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right

With or without you, I waited my whole life
I could wait a little longer
With or without you, I say that I'm alright
We just grew apart for the same things
But I know we both want the same things
You don't wanna deal with the same things
I don't wanna leave for the same things
(For the same old things)

[Chorus]
Said I'm alright
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right
Said I'm alright (Ayy!)
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right

[Bridge]
And if I was to blame
I swear that I'll pick up the pieces
You say that you don't wanna keep 'em
I'll leave one behind just in case
Through all the mistakes
I'm scared of the fact that you're leavin'
I know that we both had our reasons
But I wish that you wanted to stay, yeah
[Chorus]
Said I'm alright
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right (Ohh, yeah)
Said I'm alright (Ohh, yeah)
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right (Oh-ohh-ohh)
Said I'm alright (Ayy!)
