5 ContributorsYou Lyrics[Verse 1]
All my friends talk about the night we met
Can't remember what I said
But I bet it wasn’t cool (Bet It wasn't cool)
I was close to death with you in that perfect dress
Knowing that it's heart or head
And breaking all the rules (Breaking all the rules)
Just like don’t fall in love before I know your name
Holding out hoping that you feel the same
No, I've never been one for sounding cliché
But it's true

[Chorus]
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about how
Your leap of faith made me
Put all my faith in you
So all I do is think about

[Verse 2]
No regrets, not even the nights wе spent
Finding out what patience mеant
Holding up a mirror to myself
Learning to reflect
Because love like this doesn't come round all the time
And letting you get away would be a crime
‘Cause half of your heart makes a whole lot of this heart of mine
You might also like[Chorus]
Uuuhh, all I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about how
Your leap of faith made me
So all I do is think about you (All I do is think about you)
All I do is think about you (All I do is think about you)
All I do is think about
How long I can't wait until I say get to say I do
So all I do is think about how

[Bridge]
All my friends talk about the night we met
Can't remember what I said
But it worked out beautiful

[Chorus]
All I do is think about you (All I do is think about you)
All I do is think about you (All I do is think about you)
All I do is think about how
Your leap of faith made me put all my faith in you

[Outro]
So all I do is think about you (All I do is think about you)
All I do is think about you (All I do is think about you)
All I do is think about how
How long I can't wait until I say get to say I do (All I do is think about you)
So all I do is think about you1Embed You You Armaan Malik pop-film
