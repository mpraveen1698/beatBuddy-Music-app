[Chorus: The Raelettes & Ray Charles]
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back no more
What'd you say?
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back no more
[Verse 1: Ray Charles & The Raelettes]
Old woman, old woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (That's right)
[Chorus: The Raelettes & Ray Charles]
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back no more
What'd you say?
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back no more

Now, baby, listen, baby, don't you treat me this way
'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
Don't care if you do, cause it's understood
You ain't got no money, you just a no good
Well, I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (That's right)
[Chorus: The Raelettes & Ray Charles]
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back no more
What'd you say?
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back no more

[Outro: Ray Charles & The Raelettes]
Well (Don't ya come back no more)
Uh, what'd you say? (Don't ya come back no more)
I didn't understand you (Don't ya come back no more)
You can't mean that (Don't ya come back no more)
Oh, now, baby, please (Don't ya come back no more)
What you're trying to do to me? (Don't ya come back no more)14Embed Hit the Road Jack True Genius Ray Charles blues
