This is not a test, this is not a test
This is not a test, this is not a test

[Verse 1]
That's it, I fuckin' had it, I can't take it anymore
Yeah, I know now why I'm losing, well, just look who's keeping score
I got a vermin preaching sermon, telling me how I should think
While they're busy counting backwards, yeah, you're busy counting sheep

[Chorus]
I know I'm never going to change the world (Change the world)
I'm not sure that I could even if I tried (Full circle)
I know I'm never going to save the world (Save the world)
So I'll sit here laughing as it all goes by (Full circle)
Full circle

[Refrain]
This is not a test, this is not a test
This is not a test, this is not a test

[Verse 2]
There's a demon selling freedom to a martyr on TV
While you're watching, you should Google all the ways you've been deceived
There's a new season of treason that you really oughta see
And the bridges that they're burning, well, they all lead back to me

I know I'm never going to change the world (Change the world)
I'm not sure that I could even if I tried (Full circle)
I know I'm never going to save the world (Save the world)
So I'll sit here laughing as it all goes by (Full circle)
Full circle

[Bridge]
I know I'm never gonna change the world
I'm not sure that I could even if I tried
Full circle

[Chorus]
I know I'm never going to change the world (Change the world)
I'm not sure that I could even if I tried (Full circle)
I know I'm never going to save the world (Save the world)
So I'll sit here laughing as it all goes by (Full circle)

[Outro]
