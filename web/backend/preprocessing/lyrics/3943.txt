If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

[Verse 1]
Well, you got your reasons
And you've got your lies
And you got your manipulations
They cut me down to size

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sayin' you know, but you don't
You give your love, but you won't

[Chorus]
If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

Seems the road less traveled
Shows happiness unraveled
And you gotta take a little dirt to keep what you love
That's what you gotta do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sayin' you know, but you don't
You give your love, but you won't
You're stretchin' out your arms to somethin' that's just not there
Sayin' you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can

[Chorus]
If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're sayin' you know, but you don't
You give your love, but you won't
(But you won't)
Sayin' you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can
[Chorus]
If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me4Embed If You Could Only See Lemon Parade Tonic grunge
