Now did you hear the sound
Ascending from the ground?
I pray for those who stayed
Or died along the way
We trust the trembling air
To take us anywhere
Transcending gravity
And hoping that we'll be set free

[Chorus]
Unbound instantly
Airbourne aimlessly
We drift towards
The darkness of our heavens (Drift away)
Unbound instantly
Airbourne aimlessly
We drift apart
To finally fade away

[Verse 2]
I'm whispering your name
A memory set to flame
Like all I left behind
Becoming someone else
This time
You might also like[Chorus]
Unbound instantly
Airbourne aimlessly
We drift towards
The darkness of our heavens (Drift away, drift away)
Unbound instantly
Airbourne aimlessly
We drift apart
To finally fade away

[Chorus]
Unbound instantly
Airbourne aimlessly
We drift towards
The darkness of our heavens
Unbound instantly
Airbourne aimlessly
We drift apart
To finally fade awayEmbed St책lf책gel Verkligheten Soilwork metalcore
