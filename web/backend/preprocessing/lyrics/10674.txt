I think of feelings that I can't throw
I don't want them to fade
They're warm enough to stay
When I feel cold
To be at ease
All these feelings
To be at ease
All these feelings

These feelings are all I know
Hidden in ways that I can't show
The burden feels okay
I'm used to the weight
All alone

To be at ease
All these feelings
To be at ease
All these feelingsYou might also likeEmbed Ease Whirr & Nothing (Split Version) Whirr grunge
