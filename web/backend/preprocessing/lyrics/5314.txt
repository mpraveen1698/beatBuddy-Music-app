39 ContributorsBreathe (2 AM) Lyrics[Verse 1]
2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
"Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him, winter just wasn't my season"
Yeah, we walk through the doors, so accusing, their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl
So cradle your head in your hands

[Chorus]
And breathe
Just breathe
Oh, breathe
Just breathe

[Verse 2]
In May, he turned twenty-one on the base of Fort Bliss
"Just a day," he said down to the flask in his fist
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year
Here in town, you can tell he's been down for a while
But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, maybe I'll just sing about it
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, boys
So cradle your head in your hands

[Chorus]
And breathe
Just breathe
Oh, breathe
Just breathe

[Bridge]
There's a light at each end of this tunnel, you shout
'Cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again
If you only try turning around

[Verse 3]
2 AM and I'm still awake writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me
Threatening the life it belongs to
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them however you want to
[Pre-Chorus]
But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand

[Chorus]
And breathe
Just breathe
Oh, breathe
Just breathe
Oh, breathe
Just breathe
Oh, breathe
