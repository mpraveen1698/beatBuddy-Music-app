12 ContributorsSolid Lyrics[Intro: Burna Boy]
Yeah

[Chorus: Burna Boy]
You the type I really vibe with
So I'll forever keep it solid
We go public or keep it private, yeah
Ain't no hesitation about it
No competition, they ain't got it like you got it
So I'll forever keep it solid
We go public or keep it private, yeah
Ain't no hesitation about it

[Refrain: Burna Boy]
And if I dey for you, na forever
We go dey vibe long as we dey together
Baby, no time, you know it's now or never
'Cause, baby, the way your body dey bounce no regular
There's ups and downs, but who said I'm perfect?
Love is beautiful, but it comes with hurting
The keys and purses may defeat the purpose
Love is really deeper than meets the surface, yeah

[Chorus: Blxst]
You the type I really vibe with
Hold me down, I'll forever keep it solid
We can go public or move in silence, yeah (Shee)
It ain't no hesitation about it
No competition, they don't got it like you got it
Hold me down, I'll forever keep it solid
We can go public or keep it private, yeah
It ain't no hesitation about it

Uh, you know the streets I'm juggling
But you the only piece I'm puzzling
Girl, you dey give me peace, no trouble, yeah
It's your choice, get a Rolls-Royce Cullinan
You know the bag gotta keep on coming in
Promise the only time I need to run it up again
I gotta make the streets freeze 'fore the summer end
I hope you understand, bring you back another win, yeah

[Chorus: Blxst]
You the type I really vibe with
Hold me down, I'll forever keep it solid
We can go public or move in silence, yeah (Shee)
It ain't no hesitation about it
No competition, they don't got it like you got it
Hold me down, I'll forever keep it solid
We can go public or keep it private, yeah
It ain't no hesitation about it

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
And if they ask, yeah
Make sure you don't lack, yeah
Make sure you on task for it, don't cap on it
I like it when you brag on me
This shit deep for real
Deeper than what they see for real
I'm playing for keeps for real
Queen recognize queen for real
That's me for real
And they ain't know how to treat you
They ain't know how to keep you
Everyone before might as well keep score
On how to please you, maybe they ain't see you
[Chorus: Kehlani & Blxst]
You the type I really vibe with
Hold me down, I'll forever keep it solid
We can go public or move in silence
Ain't no hesitation about it, about it
No competition, they don't got it like you got it
Hold me down, I'll forever keep it solid
We can go public or keep it private, yeah
It ain't no hesitation about it

[Refrain: Burna Boy]
And if I dey for you, na forever
We go dey vibe long as we dey together
Baby, no time, you know it's now or never
'Cause, baby, the way your body dey bounce no regular
There's ups and downs, but who said I'm perfect?
Love is beautiful, but it comes with hurting
The keys and purses may defeat the purpose
Love is really deeper than meets the surface, yeah1Embed Solid (feat. Blxst & Kehlani) Love, Damini Burna Boy;Blxst;Kehlani dancehall
