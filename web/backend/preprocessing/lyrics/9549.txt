Lately I've been feeling so alone
Can someone give the antidote to me so I can
Finally understand where I belong
The world outside to me is like an ocean and I

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't swim
I'm losing my grip
Caught up in the current
Won't drown in this ship
I can't swim
I'm starting to slip
I'm running out of breath, I'm scared to death

[Chorus]
I gotta keep my head up up up up
Up above the water, up above the water
Gotta keep my head up up up up
I'm never going under, never going under
As long as air's in my lungs
Blood's in my veins
I'm not going down this way
I gotta keep my head up up up up
Up above the water, up abovе the water

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't swim
I'm losing my grip

I can't swim
I'm starting to slip
I'm running out of breath, I'm scared to death

[Chorus]
I gotta keep my head up up up up
Up above the water, up above the water
Gotta keep my head up up up up
I'm never going under, never going under
As long as air's in my lungs
Blood's in my veins
I'm not going down this way
I gotta keep my head up up up up
Up above the water, up above the water
[Bridge]
Holding on, still holding on
How'd it get so deep? Yeah
Holding on, still holding on
How'd it get so deep? Yeah
Holding on, still holding on
I'm running out of breath, I'm scared to death

[Chorus]
I gotta keep my head up up up up
Up above the water, up above the water
Gotta keep my head up up up up
I'm never going under, never going under
As long as air's in my lungs
Blood's in my veins
I'm not going down this way
I gotta keep my head up up up up
Up above the water, up above the water1Embed Head Up Metamorph The Score alt-rock
