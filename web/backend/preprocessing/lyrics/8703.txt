Please put me to bed
And turn down the light

[Verse 1]
Fold down your hands
Give me a sign
Put down your lies
Lay down next to me
Don't listen when I scream
Bury your doubts and fall asleep
Find out, I was just a bad dream

[Verse 2]
Let the bed sheet
Soak up my tears
And watch the only way out
Disappear
Don't tell me why
Kiss me, goodbye

[Chorus]
For neither ever, nor never
Goodbye
Neither ever, nor never
Goodbye
Neither ever, nor never
Goodbye
