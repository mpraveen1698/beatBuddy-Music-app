23 ContributorsLady in Black Lyrics[Verse 1]
She came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning
Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind
I know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me, from a fight I could not win

[Chorus]
Ahh-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ahh
Ahh-ah-ah ahh-ah-ah ahh

[Verse 2]
She asked me name my foes then, I said the need within some men
To fight and kill their brothers, without thought of love or god
And I begged her give me horses, to trample down my enemies
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life

[Chorus]
Ahh-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ahh
Ahh-ah-ah ahh-ah-ah ahh

[Verse 3]
But she would not think of battle, that, reduces men to animals
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end
For she the mother of all men had counselled me so wisely then
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay

[Verse 4]
"Oh lady lend your hand," I cried, "oh let me rest here at your side"
"Have faith and trust in me," she said, and filled my heart with life
"There is no strength in numbers, have no such misconception
But when you need me, be assured I won't be far away"

[Chorus]
Ahh-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ahh
Ahh-ah-ah ahh-ah-ah ahh

[Verse 5]
Thus having spoke she turned away, and though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear
My labour is no easier, but now I know I'm not alone
I'll find new heart each time I think upon that windy day
And if one day she comes to you, drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her as your prize, and say hello for me

[Chorus]
Ahh-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ahh
Ahh-ah-ah ahh-ah-ah ahh
[Chorus]
Ahh-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ahh
Ahh-ah-ah ahh-ah-ah ahh
