Kill dem! (Kill dem)
Will will will
Willis kill dem

[Verse: Buju]
My girl the last time that I check (check)
Now before I digress
My girl you told me that I'm not your love interest
See my girl the last time that I check (check)
See nothing ain't change yet
Except that I got a big bag gonna big big flirt

[Pre-Chorus: Buju]
So make nobody tell me nonsense ma nigga
Street is so cold ma nigga
Make nobody come try cry me a river ah
Ama pull through like the strings on my guitar ah
Nonsense ma nigga
The street is so cold ma nigga
Make nobody come try cry me a river ah
Ama pull through like the strings on my guitar ah
