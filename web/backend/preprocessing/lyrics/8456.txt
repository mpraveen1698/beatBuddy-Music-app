3 ContributorsHey (I Miss You) Lyrics[Intro]
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 1]
I walked for miles around
To the places I thought you'd be
I smiled and smiled
With the pieces of your memories
And I thought 'Hey'
I miss you like crazy

[Verse 2]
Been alone at night
And the dark's become my hell
While reading magazines
But I don't think I'm well
It's not the same
Without you here with me (With me, with me)

[Chorus]
And I said 'Hey'
Don't forget my face
Oh, and I would walk a thousand miles
Just to follow you back down
And I said 'Hey'
Can't go on this way
'Cause I can't live a day without you
'Til we meet again
I miss you

I can't live a day without you
'Til we meet again
I miss you
Whoa whoa

[Verse 3]
You were my bluе sky
When this whole world was gray
We spеnt so many years apart
But then we found our way
And I said 'Hey'
I'm broken that you left me

[Verse 4]
I can feel you here with me
Watching me cry
And I know that you meant well
But still, I wonder why
I had to be
Without you here with me (With me, with me)

[Chorus]
And I said 'Hey'
Don't forget my face
Oh and I would walk a thousand miles
Just to follow you back down
And I said 'Hey'
Can't go on this way
'Cause I can't live a day without you
'Til we meet again
I miss you
[Post-Chorus]
Whoa whoa
I miss you
Whoa whoa
I can't live a day without you
'Til we meet again
I miss you
Whoa whoa

[Outro]
Whoa whoa
I miss you
Whoa whoa
I can't live a day without you
'Til we meet again
I miss youEmbed Hey (I Miss You) Hey (I Miss You) Armin van Buuren;Simon Ward trance
