I, I always thought that I knew
I'd always have the right to
Be living in the kingdom of the good and true
And so on, but now I think I was wrong
And you were laughing along
And now I look a fool for thinking you were on my side

[Chorus 1]
Is it any wonder I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes
It's hard to know where I stand
It's hard to know where I am
Well, maybe it's a puzzle I don't understand

But sometimes
I get the feeling that I'm
Stranded in the wrong time
Where love is just a lyric in a children's rhyme
A sound bite

[Chorus 2]
Is it any wonder I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?

After all the misery you made
Is it any wonder that I feel afraid?
Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed?

[Bridge]
Nothing left beside this old cathedral
Just the sad lonely spires
How do you make it right
Oh, but you try

[Chorus 3]
Is it any wonder I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?

Oh, these days, after all the misery you made
Is it any wonder that I feel afraid?
Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed?1Embed Is It Any Wonder? Under The Iron Sea Keane piano
