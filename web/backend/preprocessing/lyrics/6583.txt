26 ContributorsA Girl Worth Fighting For Lyrics[Chorus]
For a long time, we've been marching off to battle

[YAO]
In our thundering herd, we feel a lot like cattle

[Chorus]
Like the pounding beat, our aching feet
Aren't easy to ignore

[LING]
Hey! Think of instead
A girl worth fighting for

[MULAN, spoken]
Huh?

[LING]
That's what I said! A girl worth fighting for
I want her paler than the moon
With eyes that shine like stars

[YAO]
My girl will marvel at my strength
Adore my battle scars
You might also like[CHIEN PO]
I couldn't care less what she'll wear or what she looks like
It all depends on what she cooks like
(spoken)
Beef, pork, chicken, mmm...

[YAO]
Bet the local girls thought you were quite the charmer

[LING]
And I'll bet the ladies love a man in armor

[Chorus]
You can guess what we have missed the most
Since we went off to war

[LING]
What do we want?

[Chorus]
A girl worth fighting for

[YAO]
My girl will think I have no faults

[CHIEN PO]
That I'm a major find
[MULAN]
Uh, how 'bout a girl who's got a brain
Who always speaks her mind?

[YAO, LING & CHIEN PO, spoken]
Nah!

[LING]
My manly ways and turn of phrase are sure to thrill her

[YAO]
He thinks he's such a ladykiller

[CHI-FU]
I've a girl back home who's unlike any other

[YAO]
Yeah, the only girl who'd love him is his mother

[Chorus]
But when we come home in victory
They'll line up at the door

[LING]
What do we want?
[Chorus]
A girl worth fighting for

[LING]
Wish that I had

[Chorus]
A girl worth fighting for
