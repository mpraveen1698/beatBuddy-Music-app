9 ContributorsDaily Duppy LyricsGuess who's back when I stepped through akh
Been grinding through blurred lines, like a Neptune's track
Bigger stuff hit 'em up, like a vexed 2Pac
Pause and download this, like a next new app
Simpletons ass kiss, think he's an artist
The only place that you got links is your armpit
You ignorant harmers, think that your bars sick
You VS me is like tryna sprint with an R6
Your hero he can rap, like De Niro [?]
When you rap you sound like Ben Shapiro reading WAP
Next year's not a hotel, you're all leaving
Cause I'll be killing the game for Four Seasons
Not in a bally, say I'm genuine like I didn't marry
Need gigs as big as Ally Pally, when I'm hitting manny
Don't dilly dally silly billy, getting really pally
I'd rather keep it in house, like you're in an alley
It's phenomenal, spitting horrible written chronicles
They bit and borrow tunes, if I did or didn't acknowledge you
Hidden oracle, off the head like I'm spitting follicles
It isn't possible because you're limited like a fossil fuel
Flex on tracks like Usain Bolt
Rip beats like Bruce Wayne's clothes
True say I'm like the UK's Lupe though
Like Martin get martyred for the truth they told, in new tape mode
Don't make me switch like UK Gold
You can only make bread now if you save dough
I'm who they quote, I do they don't
Dump Trump in the sea, watch his toupee float
I pour out my heart on the lane like playing Tottenham
Justice for the 72, we say it often
See refugees in the boats, they gave them coffins
We saw Wiley cancelled, but never Katie Hopkins
Crunch time, smash a tour, dumb guys rapping for
The Queen's head, make you see red like a matador
Rappers might diss, wanna analyse this
Not on your wave, over your head like a satellite dish
R.I.P. Daily Duppy D.O.A
Even though we see those pains, we obey
Even though they play tricks we will be okay
But the real matrix is when Neo wakes
I'm telling you I'm not the one, that big Morpheus
Pissed cause the historians, they're ignoring us
The sick story is still secret, I'm victorious
They talk it but don't walk it, like Pistorius
Astounded when I see these cowards sour
I can write rhymes, snakes and ladders
So how you gonna climb higher
Bide your time, they will feel your power when your light shines
Like TY, never got his flowers in his lifetime
Days so sick, that patience not a virtue
Think outside the box, beyond your circle
Rap like I wanna hurt you, it's gone commercial
But rap like I wanna help you, it's controversial
Erase your stain on the game, but not with Persil
Shower man remember your reign is not eternal
Digitally stop and search you, so stop the verbal
It's plain they'll remember my name as long as Churchill
Seems like speaking out is getting harmful
Even DJs with dodgy's getting artful
They could write articles to get your heart full
They rather do is write a hit piece on Meghan Markle
I could tear up a cypher, in sandals
Rappers are destroying the art, think vandals
It's a shamble, don't sweat it like Prince Andrew
Me and Rap like Jada and August, entangled
Make a bad boy look like Will Smith, still pissed
Spill bits on films give you chills on the real tip
Having me spitting around you is a real risk
Because COVID-19 is now not the only illness
Love to all of those suffering, in our thoughts and prayers
Mourning since last year, should have been more prepared
Now if you're coughing in public, it's an awkward stare
All know it would have been different, if it was Corbyn there
Jordan air last dance, who's laughing last
Shed a tear for all the NHS staff that passed
Economics looking shady in this aftermath
Passing hard like a marshal arts master class
Learn about their pain, better yet learn how to pronounce their names
Think you got more in common with Boris, you're out your brain
It's a dead cert, before they get better things will get worse
What can Boris say to the family of a dead nurse?
Labels only care about your streams and your record sales
They don't care about your dreams and your mental health
They don't care about these teens when they step in cells
Don't believe the machine, just protect yourself
Talker, can't compare to an author
Is the label able to care for your trauma?
You can change your life with a smooth manoeuvre
You can be a wounded healer or wounded wounder
These are rotten times, the bottom line is we need each other
It's not right the songs are right for the grieving mothers
His ex don't see the pain, just seeing the numbers
Deep the way we can betray people that love us
If you could dial up, make phone calls to heaven
Reason with ghosts, get social with legends
What would you say that you have no balls to tell them
Some of us remember, we won't all forget them
I would tell Yasin, numerous babies were named after him
Can't tarnish him, he was blessed with the heart of 10
3 years later, we're having the same arguments
The real arsonists are covered up, like a garbage lid
Comparison, thief of joy, find your blessing
Time to mention TY, they try to forget him
Death's the answer, life's a question
Rest in power Black The Ripper, you died a legendYou might also like2Embed Band Theke Band Theke Jordan Sandhu hip-hop
