They told me it will never take
No longer than a day
So I'll be on the move
I spend my time just tryna lay low
Lookin' for my way home
Lookin' out for you

[Chorus]
I hope
You come 'round
Before
We check out
I hope (Hold it out)
You come 'round (Hold it up)
Before (Hold it up)
We check out (Hold it up)

Hold it up, hold it up
