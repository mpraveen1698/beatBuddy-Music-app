24 ContributorsSunny Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sunny
Yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny
You smiled at me and really eased the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
The dark days are gone and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere

[Chorus]
Sunny, one so true
I love you

[Verse 2]
Sunny (Yeah)
Thank you for the sunshine bouquet (Thanks for the bouquets)
Sunny
Thank you for the love you've brought my way

[Pre-Chorus]
You gave to me, your all and all
And now I feel ten feet tall

[Chorus]
Sunny, one so true
I love you
