Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I've got that lightnin' inside me
Son of a God
I'm like a titan that's risin'
Oh, just you watch
I'm steppin' into fate
There is no time to waste
I've got that lightnin' inside me

[Chorus]
This is how legends are made
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
This is how legends are made
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
This is how legends are made

[Verse 2]
I'm crankin' up on the throttle
Victory is mine
Show you the harder the battle
The harder I fight
I've come too far to quit
Step back I'm goin' in
I'm crankin' up on the throttle

[Bridge]
Like iron
From the fire
Gettin' stronger
This is how legends are made
Above it all
Untouchable
A new animal

[Chorus]
