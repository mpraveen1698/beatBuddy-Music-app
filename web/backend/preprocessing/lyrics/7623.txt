I was telling him, the other day that
I would be the one to make her stay but
Who’s crying, now on my shoulder?
Who’s crying, now that I told her?

[Chorus Keyan Pourzand]
In a mile I can feel your legs
I wish away the pain, it's red
I’m draped in lead, I’m heavy as a slug
Drag the body under the rug

[Verse 2: Alex Brady]
Get out of my head
Can’t you tell that you’re dead, to me?
Talk to me instead, till we go to bed

[Bridge: Alex Brady]
Who’s crying, now on my shoulder?
Who’s crying, now that I’ve told her?

[Chorus Keyan Pourzand]
In a mile I can feel your legs
I wish away the pain, it's red
I’m draped in lead, I’m heavy as a slug
Drag the body under the rug

Her lips are ruby and I, forgot the thimble
If I can help it, she’ll caress me in the sky
But I can’t, entertain you
And I can't, help but escape you

[Chorus: Alex Brady & Keyan Pourzand]
In a mile I can feel your legs
I wish away the pain, it's red
I’m draped in lead, I’m heavy as a slug
Drag the body under the rug18Embed flutter flutter julie grunge
