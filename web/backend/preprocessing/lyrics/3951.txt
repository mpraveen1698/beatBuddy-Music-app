4 Contributors​you never meant it Lyrics[Chrous: Snøw]
You say you love me but you never meant it
No, I don't get it
I put my all in you, it's so pathetic, yeah
How you gon' say something that you don't feel?
Fuck 'round with you, can't believe this is real

[Verse 1: Snøw]
But I'ma keep cool in fact
I got the music for that
You can hear my pain all over these raps
Talking 'bout this shit just makes me feel mad
Why the fuck you had to go and do that?
Pulling the trigger, thought you had my back, ayy
Thought you had my back
Guess I was wrong
You really never were the one, oh
And that breaks my heart
'Cause I never thought you and I would part, oh

[Verse 2: cøzybøy]
You said I was the only one on the phone that you would call when you feeling upset
But you had others that you would just string along
Keep 'em around and hit up on the text
Down on the low
Put me on hold
Supposed to call back and I waited for that
'Stead you forgot
You got me staying inside
Now I sit with the wall at my back
It's pushin' the knife further and further
Yeah, and my heart is about to attack
How do I get in these situations?
Now I just wish I could have it all back, yeah

Now you got me falling
I'm falling, I'm falling
'Cause I've been all in and that's why I'm calling
You've got me falling
I'm falling, I'm falling
'Cause I've been all in and that's why I'm calling

[Chrous: Snøw]
You say you love me but you never meant it
No, I don't get it
I put my all in you, it's so pathetic, yeah
How you gon' say something that you don't feel?
Fuck 'round with you can't believe this is real

[Outro: Snøw]
How you gon' say something that you don't feel?
How you gon' say something that you don't feel?
Oh, oh
How you' gon say something that you don't feel?
Oh, ohEmbed you never meant it you never meant it Skinny Atlas;Snøw;cøzybøy sad
