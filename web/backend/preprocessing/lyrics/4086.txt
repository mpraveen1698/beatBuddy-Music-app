16 Contributors’74-’75 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Got no reason for coming to me
In the rain running down, there's no reason
And the same voice coming to me
Like it's all slowin' down and believe me

[Chorus]
I was the one who let you know
I was your sorry ever after '74-'75

[Verse 2]
It's not easy, nothing to say
'Cause it's already said, it's never easy
When I look on in your eyes then I find that I'll do fine
When I look on in your eyes then I'll do better

[Chorus]
I was the one who let you know
I was your sorry ever after '74-'75
Giving me more and I'll defy
'Cause you're really only after '74-'75

[Verse 3]
Got no reason for coming to me
In the rain running down, there's no reason
When I look on in your eyes then I find that I'll do fine
When I look on in your eyes then I'll do better
You might also like[Chorus]
I was the one who let you know
I was your sorry ever after '74-'75
Giving me more and I'll defy
'Cause you're really only after '74-'75
I was the one who let you know
I was your sorry ever after '74-'75
Giving me more and I'll defy
'Cause you're really only after '74-'75
