12 ContributorsGhost Lyrics[Verse 1]
My whole life I been curled up, worried 'bout fitting in
Don't know what I am, I just know that I'm different
Spazzed out, fidgeting
Playing with the monsters
Only open up around the creatures that I conjure
Flashlights dangling underneath the stairs
If I ever went missin', they would always meet me there
They would be the ones to love me on the nights I needed care
Never brought 'em out in public 'cause I hate when people stare
I'll be fine
Just losing track of time
Just dancing in the city with these voices in my mind
They the only ones who listen when I tell 'em what I feel
No one ever understood, and they probably never will

[Chorus]
So, I'm going now
Away, away
So, I'm going now
Awaaay
So, I'm going now
Away, away
So, I'm going now
Watch me disappear just like a ghost
Ghost, ghost
Watch me disappear just like a ghost
Ghost, ghost

Riding through the city, I'm just buzzin' alone
Close my eyes while I drive 'cause I love the unknown
Heart beating so hard, feel it thud in my bones
Can't say I Iove her, but I wrote her dozens of poems
And I almost read 'em out loud hundreds of times
Closed mouth, what a waste of a wonderful mind
She gets scared when the rain and the thunder combine
And I'm from a gloomy place where the sun doesn't shine
It wouldn't work, so, I admire from afar
Lying on the rooftop, lining up the stars
Hiding all my scars is oh-so exhausting
I just wanna get lost now

[Chorus]
So, I'm going now
Away, away
So, I'm going now
Awaaay
So, I'm going now
Away, away
So, I'm going now
Watch me disappear just like a ghost
Ghost, ghost
Watch me disappear just like a ghost
Ghost, ghost
[Bridge]
Ghost, ghost
Watch me disappear just like a ghost
Ghost, ghost

[Outro]
So, I'm going now
Away, away
So, I'm going now
Awaaay
So, I'm going now
Away, away
So, I'm going now
Watch me disappear just like a ghost8Embed Ghost At Least I Tried Ryan Caraveo sad
