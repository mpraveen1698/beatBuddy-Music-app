Mississippi queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi queen
She taught me everything

[Verse 1]
Way down around Vicksburg
Around Louisiana way
Lived a Cajun lady
They called her Mississippi Queen

[Pre-Chorus]
You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were getting their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was getting mine

[Chorus]
Mississippi queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi queen
She taught me everything

[Verse 2]
This lady she asked me
If I would be her man
You know that I told her
I'd do what I can
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
To keep her looking pretty
Buy her dresses that shine
While the rest of them dudes were making their bread
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was losing mine

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were getting their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was getting mine

[Outro]
