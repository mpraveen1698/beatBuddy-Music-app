I spend a lot of nights thinking about you
I don’'t know how or when (Eh, eh)
But I only know that I remembered (Eh, eh)
How I did it to you that time (Oh, oh)
And I can't continue to be alone (Hehe)
But I know that I threw you out
I threw you out of my life, and threw you out (Yeh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ozuna]
I cut you slack and I let you go … I let you go
To hell I sent you … and I sent you
I threw you out of my life, and threw you out
Yeh, yeh, mami

[Verse 1: Bad Bunny]
Baby life is a cycle (Wuh)
And if doesn't work, I don't recycle
So move from my life
If I give it to you it’'s to remember a TBT, yeh
I got tired of your liеs
There’'s another girl who likеs me (Yeh)
Everything has its end, everything expires (Yeh)
You’'re the past and the past never returns
Go to hell (Wuh)
My body doesn’'t need you
What it's asking for is a dirty dance in the Placita
I don’'t think our story will repeat
Go ahead, turn on a phillie and leave one ready for now, yeh eh
I hate to know that I trusted in you again
I hate all the "I Love You's" that I texted a thousand times
Baby, better than you I have like 10
Our love drove in a Bugatti and you stayed on foot, I threw you out
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Bad Bunny, Darell]
I cut you slack and I let you go … I let you go
To hell you left … and you left
And I nailed your friend, I nailed her
Fuck you, bitch (Wuh)

[Verse 2: Darell]
Baby I threw you out
And ever since I threw you out, the girls come in three's (That's right)
If you don't believe me, just ask (Baby)
That I no longer have stress
To complete the line, they're express
What a mess how your world went backwards
I messed with her
That I fell in love the day I tasted her
I don't think I'm going back and giving it to you
Mami, because I cancelled your service
If I do not answer
The problem is going to hit rock bottom
Mami breathe deeply, while I hide it (That's right)
With you I'm obligated to wear a condom today
But I'm posting in mid-court, baby, like Rondo
I give you a funeral (That's right)
I know that over time the wound heals (By law)
But the truth is that you’'re not at my level
I sweat to God even though you shouldn't swear to God (Ratatata)
[Chorus; Darell, Nio Garcia, Casper Magico]
Baby I threw you out (I threw you out)
I cut you slack and I let you go … I let you go (I cut you slack and I let you go, so you know)
To hell I sent you, eh, eh (Are you understanding what we're trying to say? To hell I sent you)
I got you out of my life, eh, eh

[Verse 3: Casper Magico]
To hell, I threw you out (Woo)
I feel good without you (Ah)
I no longer suffer for love, now I break hearts, and I have lots of $100 rolls ($100 rolls)
You broke my heart (You broke my heart) (Woo)
Without meaning and without reason (Without meaning and without reason) (Ah)
But I have a new ass who gives me a lot of affection and fucks me real good (Real good)
I'm not going to deny that I suffered and had it bad
But I survived and out of my life I threw you out (I threw you out)
I cut you slack and I let you go … (I let you go)
And I don't want to know about you
And to hell I sent you … I'm going to go drink today (Going to do drink)

[Verse 4: Ozuna]
Out of my life, I threw you out
And I know you're not just anybody
I’'ll spend my entire life
Asking where did it go
But your friend texts me
Every time she desires me
She takes a photo with me
And tells me it's for you to see it
I light up to see if I forget
Your name, your kisses, your body, your moans
We would do it in the car, you would scream in my ear
You left far from here without an explanation
You saw my movie and gave me your back
Now you want to know what I think of you
I feel good because you're not here
The same way you came, you can leave (You can leave)
I’'m not going to deny that I suffered and had it bad
But I survived and out of my life I threw you out (I threw you out)
I cut you slack and I let you go … (I let you go)
To hell I sent you …I sent you
I got you out of my life …I got you out
Baby, I threw you out
[Verse 5: Nicky Jam]
I'm lying if I tell you that I don't miss it when you would rub your skin on me
I'm lying if I tell you that I don't miss your morning calls
Asking me to give it to you rough in bed and make you my woman
I’'m taking advantage of this remix with Ozu to send you to hell also
I don't want lies or your fakeness
I'm going to the street, to a party tonight
I'll drink two drinks and I'm going to forget you
I'm leaving with the girls who want to play
I don't want lies or your fakeness
I'm going to the street, to a party tonight
I'll drink two drinks and I'm going to forget you
I’m leaving with the girls who want to play

[Chorus: Nicky Jam]
Baby I threw you out …threw you out
I cut you slack and let you go …I let you go
To hell I sent you …I sent you
And got you out of my life …I got you out
