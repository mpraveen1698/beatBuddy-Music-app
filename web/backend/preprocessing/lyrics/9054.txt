Im so fucking ugly, inside and out
No i dont think that i will find my love
I dont think that i will find my home
Devil says, that i should sell my soul

[Chorus]
You must pay ye ye ye ye
For your sins and oh maybe
They can save you my baby
But you must pay ye oh ye ye
You must pay ye ye ye ye
For your sins and oh maybe
They can save you my baby
But you must pay ye oh ye ye

[Verse 2]
Thoughts keep running inside my head and i dont know why but they want me dead
Where is my god
I just need some help
Cause demons keep screaming inside my brain
Im praying, im praying my lord
Im praying cause my devil is behind my back and he's telling me

[Chorus]
You must pay ye ye ye ye
For your sins and oh maybe
They can save you my baby
But you must pay ye oh ye ye
You must pay ye ye ye ye
For your sins and oh maybe
They can save you my baby
But you must pay ye oh ye yeYou might also like2Embed ugly Ekena Timmies;Nineteen95 chill
