35 ContributorsRIDING Lyrics[Intro]
Ridin' on your own, ashin' the cigarette beside me
Plug my nose, all this make me feel so alive
Switchin' lanes, checking my left-hand side
I'm never right, give me a break

[Post-Chorus]
Too smart (Too damn smart), December you're sweatin'
And all the nuances you're forced to accept
Talking lukewarm (Fuck it), whenever you're ready
I'll be right there whenever you need

[Verse 1]
Shimmy shimmy roll-up or sippy on Mimosa (Ridin')
I want a ménage, crown on mе, Ayatollah
I want my garage to fit a Bentley and a Rovеr
Your energy I like, make me wan' sign my whole life over to you
Realize I put my celly on mute
Fantasies, I don't wan' have you alone

[Chorus]
Ridin' on your own, ashin' the cigarette beside me
Plug my nose, all this make me feel so alive
Switchin' lanes, checking my left-hand side
I'm never right, give me a break
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Too smart (Too damn smart), December you're sweatin'
And all the nuances you're forced to accept
Talking lukewarm (Fuck it), whenever you're ready
I'll be right there whenever you need

[Bridge]
And you'll be ridin' on your own
And you'll be ridin'

[Verse 2]
And you'll be ridin' (On your own)
I don't see you in the same light I did
All my friends, family look at me like a giant
Touch the skies with five fingers, and I love my
Self so much, they probably thinkin', "Why you ridin'?"

[Chorus]
On your own, ashin' the cigarette beside me
Plug my nose, all this make me feel so alive
Switchin' lanes, checking my left-hand side
I'm never right, give me a break

[Outro]
