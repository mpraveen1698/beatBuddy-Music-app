82 ContributorsSoft Boy Lyrics[Verse 1: Wilbur Soot with mxmtoon]
I'm living the dream
It's just one of those dreams where you're losing all your teeth
And if you think that it gets better
Darling, take a look at me
I'm in too deep
It's the same dried ramen in a bowl I'm too lazy to clean
But I'm not drunk-texting my ex anymore
I hope my father could be proud of me

[Pre-Chorus: Wilbur Soot with mxmtoon]
Still, I won't wear the cat ears
I won't wear the cat ears
I won't wear the cat ears

[Chorus: Wilbur Soot with mxmtoon]
It's not an ahegao hoodie, it's a work of art
I get turned on by my reflection in passing cars
I'm looking for a window to another world
Where I don't feel as lost and bored
I just don't wanna be a soft boy anymore
I wanna be yours

[Verse 2: Wilbur Soot with mxmtoon, mxmtoon]
I'm living the dream
If you consider the dream to be haircuts and apathy
And if you think that I'll get better
Well, darling, take a look at me
I'm in too deep
It's the same hairstyle that I've had since I was seventeen
And I don't know why (I don't, why)
Mother, are you proud of me?

Still, I won't wear the cat ears
I won't wear the cat ears
I won'tâ€”I won't wear the cat ears
Please, please, just don't make me wear the cat ears
I'm so done with the cat ears, please

[Chorus: Wilbur Soot with mxmtoon]
It's not an ahegao hoodie, it's a work of art
I get turned on by my reflection in passing cars
I'm looking for a window to another world
Where I don't feel as lost and bored
I just don't wanna be a soft boy anymore
I wanna be yours

[Outro: Wilbur Soot]
I wanna be your-our-ours
I wanna be yours, our-ours
It's not an ahegao hoodie, it's a work of art45Embed Soft Boy Soft Boy Wilbur Soot indie-pop
