11 ContributorsCloud Connected Lyrics[Verse 1]
People like you
You live in a dream world
You despise the outside
And you fear the next one!

[Verse 2]
It's in your dream
There's just one question
Should I kill, or should I be left behind?
Sick and tired
Of all your complaints
This is the hour
We bring it down

[Chorus]
I've come to realize
With every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
Oh, when least expected, cloud connected

[Verse 3]
You seem to be
So introverted
How come we fail?
With all that is given

You crossed the line
You remembered my name
Time runs backwards
And we're heading that way

[Chorus]
I've come to realize
With every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
Oh, when least expected, cloud connected
(Cloud connected)
