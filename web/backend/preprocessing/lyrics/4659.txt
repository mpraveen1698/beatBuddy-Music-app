1 ContributorTake the long way home - 2010 remastered LyricsSo you think you're a Romeo
Playing a part in a picture show
Take the long way home
Take the long way home
'Cos you're the joke of the neighborhood
Why should you care if you're feeling good?
Take the long way home
Take the long way home
But there are times that you feel you're part of the scenery
Oh, all the greenery is comin' down, boy
And then your wife seems to think you're part of the furniture
Oh, it's peculiar, she used to be so nice
When lonely days turn to lonely nights
You take a trip to the city lights
And take the long way home
Take the long way home
You never see what you want to see
Forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home
Take the long way home
And when you're up on the stage, it's so unbelievable
Oh, unforgettable, how they adore you
But then your wife seems to think you're losing your sanity
Oh, calamity, is there no way out?
Oh, yeah
(Oh, just don't give up)
(Don't, don't give it up)
(Ooo yeah)
Does it feel that you life's become a catastrophe?
Oh, it has to be for you to grow, boy
And when you look through the years
And see what you could have been
Oh, what might have been
If you'd had more time
So, when the day comes to settle down
Who's to blame if you're not around?
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
(Tu, ru, ru, yea)
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
(Oh yeah)
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
(Ooo yeah)
You took the long way home
(Yeah)
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)
(Yeah)
(Long way home)
(Long way home)
