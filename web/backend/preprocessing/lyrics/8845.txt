When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid; no, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus]
So darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me

[Verse 2]
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no no no, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand by me

[Chorus]
And darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh darlin', stand by me, stand by me, stand by me

[Bridge]
Whoa-oh, hey, my my my my my my my
If the mountains should crumble to the sea
My my my my my my my

[Outro]
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
So darlin', darlin', stand, oh-oh, ooh, oh
Long as I know I got you right here, right here by my side
Come on, come on, just stand, stand right here
Whenever you're in trouble, won't you standEmbed Stand by Me Soul Seal british
