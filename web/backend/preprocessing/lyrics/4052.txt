Oh, who is she?
A misty memory
A haunting face
Is she a lost embrace?

[Verse 1: Bob Fields]
Am I in love with just a theme?
Or is Ayesha just a dream?
A mystery
Oh, who is she?

[Chorus: Bob Fields]
Oh, who is she?
A misty memory
A haunting face
Is she a lost embrace?

[Verse 2: Bob Fields]
I call her name
Across an endless plain
She'll answer me
Where ever she may be

Oh, who is she? (Oh, who is she?)
A misty memory (A misty memory)
A haunting face (A haunting face)
Is she a lost embrace?

[Verse 3: Bob Fields]
Somewhere across the sea of time
A love immortal such as mine
Will come to me
Eternally
