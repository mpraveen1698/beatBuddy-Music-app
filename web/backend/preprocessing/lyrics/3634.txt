Always think about you
Always thought I'd have a life I could grow with you
But as time fades, crazy how our lives changed
Feelin' like a shockwave without you
Always think about you
Always thought I'd have a life I could grow with you
But as time fades, crazy how our lives changed
Feelin' like a shockwave without you

[Chorus]
Always think about you
Always thought I had a life I could grow with you
As time fades, crazy how our lives changed
Feelin' like a shockwave without you

[Build]
Feelin' like a shockwave, shockwave, shockwave, shockwave
Shockwave, shockwave, shockwave, shockwave
Oh yeah, baby, hit 'em with a shockwave

[Drop]
Oh yeah, baby, hit 'em with a shockwave
