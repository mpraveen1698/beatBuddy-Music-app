32 ContributorsRiot Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you feel so empty
So used up, so let down
If you feel so angry
So ripped off, so stepped on

[Pre-Chorus]
You're not the only one
Refusing to back down
You're not the only one
So get up

[Chorus]
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

[Verse 2]
If you feel so filthy
So dirty, so fucked up
If you feel so walked on
So painful, so pissed off

[Pre-Chorus]
You're not the only one
Refusing to back down
You're not the only one
So get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

[Bridge]
If you feel so empty
So used up, so let down
If you feel so angry
Just get up
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot, yah

[Chorus]
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
