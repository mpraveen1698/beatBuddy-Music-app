6 ContributorsClose Your Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
We felt the world go up in flames
And now we're nothin' but a memory
So now I long for yesterday
I never thought I'd miss the rain

[Chorus]
We can hold on to forever
We're alone, but we're together
Through the night, through the night
I'm by your side
So hold on to me forever
We're alone, but we're together
Through the night, through the night
I'm by your side
Just close your eyes

[Drop]
Just close your еyes
Close your eyеs
I'm by your side

[Verse 2]
We tell ourselves it's not too late
Ten thousand days, a million miles away
So every night, I lie awake
And think of all the things I'd say
In every dream, I see your face
You might also like[Chorus]
We can hold on to forever
We're alone, but we're together
Through the night, through the night
I'm by your side
So hold on to me forever
We're alone, but we're together
Through the night, through the night
I'm by your side
Just close your eyes

[Drop]
Just close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
I'm by your side

[Chorus]
We can hold on to forever
We're alone, but we're together
Through the night, through the night
I'm by your side
So hold on to me forever
We're alone, but we're together
Through the night, through the night
I'm by your side
