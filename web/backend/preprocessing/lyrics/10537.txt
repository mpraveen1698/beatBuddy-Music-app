4 ContributorsDemon Time LyricsFiend, for that thing when you let me in between
101, with my hand inside your jeans
Feeling numb, xannies got me half asleep
In my head, I’ve been lost inside a dream

And I know you’re only here for the ride, baby
But you know I’m always on demon time, baby
And you’ll never get me out of your mind, baby, till I die, baby
It’s fine shawty
Never tripping, they said legends don’t die shawty
If it ain’t you then I got someone in mind for me
I just need someone that’s always gon’ ride for me
So just lie to me

Run
On thе run, only want you for some fun
This ain’t love, I just say that when I’m drunk
You ain’t minе, he can have you when I’m done
To the next, don’t belong to anyone

And I know you’re only here for the ride, baby
But you know I’m always on demon time, baby
And you’ll never get me out of your mind, baby, till I die, baby
It’s fine shawty
Never tripping, they said legends don’t die shawty
If it ain’t you then I got someone in mind for me
I just need someone that’s always gon’ ride for me
So just lie to me

Just lie to me, ohh
Just lie, just lie, just lie, just lie to me
To me, to me, to me
Yeah

City never sleeps, grind is on repeat
Can’t accept defeat, gave her to the streets, I’m
Riding up the 2, skyline in my rear view
Chauffeur to the Louvre, chauffeur to her crib too
Stressing out, all these strangers in the penthouse
Demons out, she gon’ top me in the Benz now
Acid drops, I can’t get out of my dark thoughts
See them opps, see them plotting on my downfall

Fiend
And I know you’re only here for the ride, baby
But you know I’m always on demon time, baby
And you’ll never get me out of your mind, baby, so don’t try, baby1Embed Demon Time The Dark Ages Aaryan Shah soul
