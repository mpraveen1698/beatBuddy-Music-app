45 ContributorsWar of Hearts Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come to me
In the night hours
I will wait for you
And I can't sleep
'Cause thoughts devour
Thoughts of you consume

[Chorus]
I can't help but love you
Even though I try not to
I can't help but want you
I know that I'd die without you

[Verse 2]
Stay with me
A little longer
I will wait for you
Shadows creep
And want grows stronger
Deeper than the truth

[Chorus]
I can't help but love you
Even though I try not to
I can't help but want you
I know that I'd die without you
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
I can't help but be wrong in the dark
'Cause I'm overcome in this war of hearts
I can't help but want oceans to part
'Cause I'm overcome in this war of hearts

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I can't help but love you
Even though I try not to
I can't help but want you
I know that I'd die without you

[Post-Chorus]
I can't help but be wrong in the dark
'Cause I'm overcome in this war of hearts
I can't help but want oceans to part
'Cause I'm overcome in this war of hearts17Embed War Of Hearts Up In Flames Ruelle electro
