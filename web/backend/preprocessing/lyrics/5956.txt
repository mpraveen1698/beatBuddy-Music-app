There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
The song that I can sing but I can try for your heart
Our dreams, they are made out of real things
Like a, shoebox of photographs with sepia-toned loving
Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart
Like, "Why are we here?" and "Where do we go?"
And "How come it's so hard?"
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together

[Chorus: Both]
Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

[Verse 2: Michael]
And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings
And brings new things for tomorrow night, you'll see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do
But if all of the dreams might find a way into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression I was somewhere in-between
With only two, just me and you
Not so many things we got to do or places we've got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now
You might also like[Chorus: Both]
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in-between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

[Verse 3: Both]
I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now, when I wake up
You look so pretty, sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
There is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together4Embed Better Together Better Together Us The Duo acoustic
