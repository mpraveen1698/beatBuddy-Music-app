I could be Elvis on a Tuesday night
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, alright
I can look good in a certain light
So don't look too closely at me tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And honey, I could play the Joker
My made up smile broke your heart last night
No, no, no, I didn't want to hurt ya
But there's just a certain culture when you're young
When you're young

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll take you to an honest place
Darling, I just can't find my honest face, my honest face

[Verse 2]
I could be a killer, gonna get you whacked
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the back
And you have to get up to try and get out of hand
It's all working out just like I planned

[Pre-Chorus]
And honey, I could play the hater
Acting like I hated her last night
No, no no, I didn't want to hurt you
But there's just a certain culture when you're young
C-call it fun
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby, I'll take you to an honest place
Darling, I just can't find my honest face, my honest face

[Bridge]
I-I-I wanna be
Up-up-up on TV, yeah
K-k-killing fear
I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna
I-I-I wanna be
On TV yeah
I wanna be
K-k-killing fear
K-k-killing fear
K-k-killing what I wanna, wanna be

[Chorus]
I'll take you to an honest place
Darling, I just can't find my honest face
It's all over the place, it's all over the place6Embed My Honest Face It Won't Always Be Like This Inhaler dub
