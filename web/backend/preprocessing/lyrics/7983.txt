One more night, one more night till the morning
One more night, one more night till the day
I'll be right, I'll be right in the morning
I'll be alright, I'll be right in the day

Lord I believe it
One more night till the morning
Lord I believe it
One more night till the morning

I'll be trying, I'll be trying in the morning
I'll be trying, I'll be trying in the day
No more lies, no more lies in the morning
No more lies, no more lies in the day

[Chorus]
Lord I believe it
One more night till the morning
Lord I believe it
One more night till the morning

[Bridge]
I'll be holding on, holding in
I'll be holding on and holding in
I'll be holding on and holding in
