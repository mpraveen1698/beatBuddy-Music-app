53 ContributorsThe Rock Show Lyrics[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

[Verse 3: Mark Hoppus]
When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin' explanation

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance, I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show
[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
