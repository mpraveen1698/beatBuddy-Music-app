34 ContributorsRise Lyrics[Verse 1: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
All I see is shattered pieces
I can't keep it hidden like a secret
I can't look away
From all this pain in a world we made
Everyday you need
A bulletproof vest
To save yourself from what you could never guess!
Am I safe today?
When I step outside in the wars we wage!

[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper]
Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

[Chorus: John Cooper]
Sound it off, this is the call
Rise in revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise and revolution
Unite and fight to make a better life
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call
Tonight, we rise

[Post-Chorus: John Cooper]
Rise
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise!
Rise, rise

Like a hand grenade
Thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos
Trying to escape the flame
Yesterday is gone
Faster than the blast of a car bomb
And when the scars heal
The pain passes
As hope burns, we rise from the ashes
Darkness fades away
And the light shines on a brave new day

[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper]
Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

[Chorus: John Cooper]
Sound it off, this is the call
Rise in revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise in revolution
Unite and fight to make a better life
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call
Tonight, we rise
[Post-Chorus: John Cooper]
Rise
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise!
Rise, rise

[Bridge: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
In a world gone mad
In a place so sad
Sometimes it's crazy, crazy
To fight for what you believe
But you can't give up, no
If you wanna keep what you love!
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Never give up, no

[Interlude 1]
Rise
Rise in revolution
Rise
Rise in revolution
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call
Rise
Like we're alive
Tonight, we rise
Make a better life
Tonight, we rise!

[Chorus: Opera]
Rise, rise, rise and revolution
Rise, rise, rise and revolution
Rise

[News reporter] We are getting new reports from all around the globe, showing the highest unemployment rates since the end of World War II. Many are losing their jobs, their homes, and in many cases, their hope

[Upset parent] You are such a failure! What is wrong with you? You can't do anything right! I wish you had never been born!8Embed Rise Rise (Deluxe Edition) Skillet metal
