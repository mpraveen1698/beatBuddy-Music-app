Hmm
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hmm-hmm

[Verse 1]
When I'm lost, when I'm low
How do you always know?
Oh, you're right there to save me
At the end of my rope
When I'm floatin' in space
How do you stay in place?
When the whole world is caving
Oh, you're my saving grace

[Chorus]
You make me wonder, woman
How do you do it?
Some superpower
I don't understand
You make me wonder, woman
How do you do it?
You're superhuman
And I'm just a man

[Verse 2]
You're the best at my worst
More than what I deserve
Always right there beside me
Could've put yourself first
Give me hope, give me help
When I'm goin' through hell
Showed me lovin' somebody
Starts with lovin' myself
