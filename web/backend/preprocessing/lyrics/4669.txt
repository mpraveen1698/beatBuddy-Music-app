1 ContributorAll Mine Lyrics[Verse]
So what if I'm honest
So what if I am
So what if I want him
Like no one else, no one else
So what if I'm dreaming
And living a lie
I'll give the same reply
Every single time

[Chorus]
He's all mine
Oh, baby, he's all mine
Our hearts, they beat in time
Oh, baby, he's all mine
And you know we don't need to try
Oh, baby, he's all mine
You know he treats me like
No one else, no one else

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
He's all mine
Oh baby, hе's all mine
Our hearts, they bеat in time
Oh baby, he's all mine
And you know we don't need to try
Oh baby, he's all mine
You know he treats me like
No one else, no one else
