Takes time to heal
Takes time to know where your heart is at
Takes time to be real
But days keep on passing me by
Takes time to heal
Takes time to know where your heart is at
Takes a man to be real
Takes a woman to know that

Takes time to heal
Takes time to be real
Takes time to heal
Takes time to know where your heart is at
Takes a man to be real
Takes a woman to know that

[Chorus]
It takes time to heal
Takes time to know where your heart is at
Takes time to be real
But days keep on passing me by
It takes time to heal
It takes time to know where your heart is at
It takes a man to be real
It takes a woman to know thatSee Swedish House Mafia LiveGet tickets as low as $106You might also like2Embed Time (feat. Mapei) Paradise Again Swedish House Mafia;Mapei progressive-house
