Light was pouring down upon the stepping stones
Felt like morning coming for his throne
I don’t know why but it looked like a tiger striped sky

Half the world was pulling on his colors
As night surrendered day to the hours
A glow was coming down, coming down
I don’t know why but if felt like a tiger striped sky

Tell me why
I’m underneath the tiger striped sky
Oh tell me why
I’m underneath the tiger striped sky

Tired of seeing adventures on café walls
Think I’ll take a turn from the known road
Think I’ll write a tale of my own
I’m going southbound to where the ocean’s flirting with the coast

Tell me why
I’m underneath the tiger striped sky
Oh tell me why
I’m underneath the tiger striped sky

So I’ll be giving up my stripes
Be painting with new colors
Beginning with dove-white
Oh I’ll be giving up my stripes
Be painting with new colors
Beginning with dove-white
(Oh I’ll be giving up my stripes)
(Be painting with new colors)
(Beginning with dove-white)
(Oh I’ll be giving up my stripes)
(Be painting with new colors)
(Beginning with dove-white)You might also likeEmbed Tiger Striped Sky Little Giant Roo Panes british
