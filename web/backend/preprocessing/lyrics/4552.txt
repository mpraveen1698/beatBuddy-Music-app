12 ContributorsNever Say Goodbye Lyrics[Verse 1]
As I sit in this smoky room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend
Rememberin' when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember how we used to talk
About bustin' out, we'd break their hearts
Together forever

[Chorus]
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we've gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Remember days of skippin' school
Racin' cars and bein' cool
With a six-pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go
Remember at the prom that night
You and me, we had a fight
But the band, they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
We danced so close, we danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together forever

[Chorus]
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we've gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and I guess you'd say we used to talk
About bustin' out, we'd break their hearts
Together forever

[Chorus]
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
