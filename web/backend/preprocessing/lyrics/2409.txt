Life's too short to even care at all, whoa oh-oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control
These fishes in the sea, they're staring at me
Whoa oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum, oh-whoa oh, oh

[Chorus]
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away to some fortune that
I should have found
By now
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down, come down

[Verse 2]
Life's too short to even care at all, oh-whoa, oh
I'm coming up now, coming up now
Out of the blue, oh-oh, oh-oh
These zombies in the park, they're looking for my heart
Oh-whoa, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun
Oh-whoa oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away, to some fortune that
I should have found
By now
And so I run now to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down
You might also like[Bridge]
Life's too short to even care at all, oh, whoa-oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away, to some fortune that
I should have found
By now
So I run now to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down

[Outro]
One more spoon of cough syrup now, oh, whoa-oh
One more spoon of cough syrup now, whoa, oh, whoa55Embed Cough Syrup Young The Giant (Special Edition) Young the Giant alt-rock
