Be ignored by the stiff and the bored because I'm gonna
Spit and retrieve 'cause I give and receive because I wanna
Gonna get through your head what the mystery man said because I'm gonna

Turn my back on the rot that's been planning the plot because I'm gonna
No need for me to wait because I wanna
No need two, three too late because I'm gonna

[Chorus]
Hate to say I told you so

Gonna call all the shots for the no's and the nots because I wanna
