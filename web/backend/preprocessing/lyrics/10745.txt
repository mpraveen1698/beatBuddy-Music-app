2 Contributorsâ€‹mon amour Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby, don't you know you read my lips?
You're coming to my dreams now
Night or day (Night or day)
You know, I guess our love
Loses its life for you
When we're away (So far away)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you can recognize
Baby, you're my kryptonite
Honestly, you make me wanna
Leave for you right now
Can you feel that trip to mine?
Pull up like I owe you vice
Honestly, I'm down for something
Close to you right now

[Chorus]
Mon amour
You know you free my soul
You ride my wave, I control
You guide the way like your told
Mon amour
I know I free your soul
I ride your wave, you control
I guide the way like I'm told
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Je t'aime, mon amour ('mour)
I've been up wildin' (Wildin')
Your love is so violent (Violent)
You givin' me solace (Solace)
Je t'aime, mon amour ('mour)
Puttin' the miles in (Miles in)
Few hunnin' and I'm drivin' (Drivin')
You make me wanna dive in (Dive in)

[Verse 2]
Baby, don't you know I feel your lies?
You're talking in your sleep about
What you hate (What you hate)
You know, I guess our love
Chooses to pull us
In tighter 'til late ('til late)

[Pre-Chorus]
On my way to hold you tight
Almost like you can't decide
Honestly, I can't believe
I'm close to you right now
Climb into the driver's side
Finally, our worlds collide
Honestly, you make me wanna
Sin for you right now
[Chorus]
Mon amour
You know you free my soul
You ride my wave, I control
You guide the way like your told
Mon amour
I know I free your soul
I ride your wave, you control
I guide the way like I'm told

[Post-Chorus]
Je t'aime, mon amour ('mour)
I've been up wildin' (Wildin')
Your love is so violent (Violent)
You givin' me solace (Solace)
Je t'aime, mon amour ('mour)
Puttin' the miles in (Miles in)
Few hunnin' and I'm drivin' (Drivin')
You make me wanna dive in (Dive in)1Embed mon amour mon amour GEMINI chill
