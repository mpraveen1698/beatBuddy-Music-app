8 ContributorsThe Lotto Lyrics[Chorus: Ingrid Michaelson & AJR]
My oh my, oh my oh my
That money's not for me
My oh my, I don't gotta hit the lotto
'Cause I gotta lot of loving for free

[Verse 1: Ingrid Michaelson]
I keep it simple and not too bright
We'll take the quiet, over the crowd
With empty pockets we'll live out loud
We don't need no treasure, we don't need no crown
So–

[Chorus: Ingrid Michaelson & AJR]
My oh my, oh my oh my
That money's not for me
My oh my, I don't gotta hit the lotto
'Cause I gotta lot of loving for free
My oh my, oh my oh my
Do you see what I see?
My oh my, I don't gotta hit the lotto
'Cause I gotta lot of loving for free
I gotta lot of loving for free

[Verse 2: AJR, Ingrid Michaelson
(AJR & Ingrid Michaelson)]
This life is funny, it don't make sense
You've got it all figured out, you're still a mess
Put on that old suit
Put on that dress
They say the best things in life cost less
So we say–

[Bridge: Ingrid Michaelson
(AJR & Ingrid Michaelson)]
We don't need nothing fancy
Just a skyline and a view
Hand in hand, down on Delancey
We got it all and we got nothing
And there's nothing left to do

My oh my, I don't gotta hit the lotto
'Cause I gotta lot of loving for free
I gotta lot of loving for free
