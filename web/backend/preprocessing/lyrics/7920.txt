Comin' from the NextLane

[Chorus]
You inside my head got me stressed, oh well
Tell me she in love, oh no I can't tell
Got me hypnotized under her spell
Girl I swear you came straight from hell
You are such an evil love
Got me shakin' by your touch
Won't talk I won't say too much
Just know we over, yeah we done

[Verse]
You was a distraction, you could not imagine
Damage that you caused, shawty you had me collapsin'
Now I don't give two fucks
See me riding, big body back of the new truck
Think I'm falling in love really got shawty starstruck
If you try to run up on me, huh, well good luck
Swear she so obsessed, glued to me, huh, she's stuck
Know she a demon girl, know she bad luck
When you come around, you bringin' me down
You're so damn controlling
Feel my heart is folding
Feel it in my chest, heartbreak is loading
Over you, huh, no pain I'm holding
Playing games, huh, you must be joking
Want me back, I know she hoping
So in regret, I know she's soaking
You might also like[Bridge]
You fucked up and you can't come back
You switched up, thought you had my back
See me with a new June, no she ain't mad
That's too bad
'Cause love ain't real and you cannot deny that

[Chorus]
You inside my head got me stressed, oh well
Tell me she in love, oh no I can't tell
Got me hypnotized under her spell
Girl I swear you came straight from hell
You are such an evil love
Got me shakin' by your touch
Won't talk I won't say too much
Just know we over, yeah we done1Embed Hypnotized Hypnotized Unodavid emo
