How can I decide what's right
When you're clouding up my mind?
I can't win your losing fight
All the time
Nor can I ever own what's mine
When you're always taking sides
But you won't take away my pride

[Pre-Chorus]
No, not this time
Not this time

[Chorus]
How did we get here
When I used to know you so well?
But how did we get here?
Well, I think I know

[Verse 2]
The truth is hiding in your eyes
And it's hanging on your tongue
Just boiling in my blood
But you think that I can't see
What kind of man that you are
If you're a man at all
Well, I will figure this one out
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
On my own (I'm screaming, "I love you so")
On my own (But my thoughts, you can't decode)

[Chorus]
But how did we get here
When I used to know you so well? Yeah
How did we get here?
Well, I think I know

[Bridge]
Do you see what we've done?
We've gone and made such fools of ourselves
Do you see what we've done?
We've gone and made such fools of ourselves

[Breakdown]
Yeah, yeah
Hey

[Chorus]
How did we get here
When I used to know you so well? Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, how did we get here
When I used to know you so well?
[Post-Chorus]
I think I know
I think I know

[Outro]
Ooh, there is something
I see in you
It might kill me
I want it to be true57Embed Decode Decode Paramore punk
