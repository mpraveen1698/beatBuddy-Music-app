67 ContributorsRoses (Imanbek Remix) Lyrics[Refrain]
Roses
I walked in the corner with the body screamin' dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
She might get it poppin', I might wife her for the winter
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses

[Chorus]
Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna
And I know you won't tell nobody nothin'
And I know you won't tell nobody no

[Bridge]
Roses
I might pull up flexin' on these niggas like aerobics
I might tell her, "Girl, you cute but ballin'," that shit gorgeous
Standin' on the table, Rosé, Rosé, fuck the waters
You know who the God is
You might also like[Chorus]
Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna
