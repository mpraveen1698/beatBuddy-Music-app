10 ContributorsSteal Lyrics[Verse 1: Holly]
You were running blind
Following your feet to try
And outrun your fate
Standing in a field of flowers
Cerebral voices the loudest
All hollering your name
Is it paradise?
Only if it blows your mind
And then blows you away

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you wheel
Sometimes you deal
Sometimes you have to rob and steal

[Chorus]
Call you a sinnerman
Or call it second sight
Now they treat 'em all the same
And it's the the thinnest line
They hung you out by
You were holding my hands and saying
"What if I only ever took what's mine?"
I wanted to tell them
That if I could've led a different life
Could've led a different life
But now I need somebody who can ease my mind
Need somebody who can ease my mind
You know I could've led a different life
Could've led a different life

Pulling me aside
Giving me your last advice
And the whole house shakes
Saying keep it in the family, hide it
Don't make the mistakes that I did
'Cause it'll wear your soul away
And I would've tried if only it was black and white
But it's bullet gray

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you wheel
Sometimes you deal
Sometimes you have to rob and steal

[Chorus 2]
Call you a sinnerman
Call it second sight
Now they treat 'em all the same
It's the thinnest line
To hang you by
Holding my hands and saying
"You know I only ever took what's mine"
I wanted to tell them
That if I could've led a different life
Could've led a different life
But now I need somebody who can ease my mind
Need somebody who can ease my mind
You know I
Need the remedy to cure my vice
Need the Valium to sleep at night
(Night)
[Chorus 3]
What if I only ever took what's mine?
I wanted to tell them
That if I could have led a different life
Could've led a different life
But now I need somebody who can ease my mind
Need the remedy to cure my vice
Need somebody who can ease my mind3Embed Steal Portraits Maribou State;Holly Walker garage
