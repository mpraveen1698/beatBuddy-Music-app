Obviously words bleed
And stress can dye your hair
Silver, what is luxury
If you spend it? It's not fair
We don't argue like we used to
It used to be like every week
I don't really miss the old you
'Cause the new one's pretty sweet

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't explain
The way it feels
To watch you grow
Head over heels
Into the one you weren't sure you'd be
It's crazy how
We live our lives
We spent it all
On borrowed time
Imagine that
Now you're eighteen

[Chorus]
I can't beliеve we made it
Oh God, I thought I might losе you
Hang on to love, sin, and your youth
You thought that you'd never be enough
Enough
I can't believe we made it
Thank God that he didn't take you
It's hard, but each breath's a breakthrough
Wake up, you take all the ups with the downs, downs, downs
You might also like[Verse 2]
And I don't think that anybody thought that we would make it this far
Ooh, yeah
And even if they did then, I don't think that they were thinkin' that hard

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't explain
The way it feels
To watch you grow
Head over heels
Into the one you weren't sure you'd be
It's crazy how
We live our lives
We spent it all
On borrowed time
Imagine that
Now you're eighteen

[Chorus]
I can't believe we made it
Oh God, I thought I might lose you
Hang on to love, sin, and your youth
You thought that you'd never be enough
Enough
I can't believe we made it
Thank God that he didn't take you
It's hard, but each breath's a breakthrough
Wake up, you take all the ups with the downs, downs, downs
[Bridge]
Time heals if you let it
Feel pain, then forget it
It'll get easier and easier
And easier
Ohh
Time heals if you let it
Feel pain, then forget it
It'll get easier and easier
And easier

[Chorus]
I can't believe we made it
Oh God, I thought I might lose you
Hang on to love, sin, and your youth
You thought that you'd never be enough
Enough
I can't believe we made it
Thank God that he didn't take you
It's hard, but each breath's a breakthrough
Wake up, you take all the ups with the downs, downs, downs5Embed we made it. Blossom Hill david hugo indie-pop
