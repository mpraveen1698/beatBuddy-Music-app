Now if you're feelin' kinda low 'bout the dues you've been payin'
Future's comin' much too slow
And you wanna run but somehow you just keep on stayin'
Can't decide on which way to go
[Chorus]
I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People living in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind
[Verse 2]
Now you're climbing to the top of the company ladder
Hope it doesn't take too long
Can't you see there'll come a day when it won't matter
Come a day when you'll be gone

[Chorus]
I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People living in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind

[Bridge]
Take a look ahead
Take a look ahead
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Now everybody's got advice they just keep on givin'
Doesn't mean too much to me
Lots of people have to make believe they're livin'
Can't decide who they should be

[Chorus]
I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People living in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind

[Outro]
Take a look ahead
Take a look ahead
Look ahead!17Embed Peace of Mind Boston Boston hard-rock
