1 ContributorLooking Up Lyrics[Verse]
I got this feeling, feel it every night
Hearts beating, going black and white
I see you shining, see you going far
Like a diamond, like a shooting star

[Pre-Chorus]
(Echo, echo)
I know it's time for me to (let go, let go)
But I can still hear your (echo, echo)
Every moment, every echo, echo, echo

[Chorus]
I'm looking up and you look down
Thought you were gone, but you're lost and found
If I could feel you one more time
Won't be alone again 'cause I'm looking up
I'm looking up and you look down
Thought you were gone, but you're lost and found
If I could feel you one more time
Won't be alone again 'cause I'm looking up for you
Won't bе alone again 'cause I'm looking up for you

[Verse]
It's human nature, but it's still killing mе
Cut like a razor, guess it was meant to be
You hear me calling, you see me wait around
Just give me something, so won't you come back down
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
(Echo, echo)
I know it's time for me to (let go, let go)
But I can still hear your (echo, echo)
Every moment, every echo, echo, echo

[Chorus]
I'm looking up and you look down
Thought you were gone, but you're lost and found
If I could feel you one more time
Won't be alone again 'cause I'm looking up
I'm looking up and you look down
Thought you were gone, but you're lost and found
If I could feel you one more time
Won't be alone again 'cause I'm looking up for you

[Outro]
Won't be alone again 'cause I'm looking up
I'm looking up and you look down
Thought you were gone, but you're lost and found
If I could feel you one more time
Won't be alone again 'cause I'm looking up for youEmbed Looking Up Looking Up John De Sohn swedish
