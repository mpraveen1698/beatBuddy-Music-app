5 ContributorsJust Awake LyricsKasanatte'ta mune no oto
Yusabutte mo kikoenai
Koboreochita PIISU

Konna nichijou no yuuutsu sae
Tameiki mo dezu ni mukanjou na bokura

Life filled with vanity
Colors have faded
Things you desire exist here
Flee from this colorless world

Tsugihagi no kokoro wa fuantei
Arainagasareta shoki shoudou o yobisamashite hashiridase
Mazui kotoba omou mama ni tsunagu yo ano hi no kodou
Wasurenaide

Oh my lord, it's gone!!
What shall I do?
Pieces I had have fell apart
Where do you belong?
Where should I aim for?
Once you've lost sight it's left to fall apart

Let's start it over again
Rebuild and combine all the pieces we have lost
To become one like a puzzle
Take it one at a time

Tying my body onto the ground
As I sink underground I call your name
What can I do to see the day light once more?

Tear it apart and rip it off
Break the chain now
Sink down or swim up
Fight your way through
Seek your way out
If you can not, you are left to drown deep inside
Chain tangled me harder, choking my neck

Tsuyogatte'ta boku no koto
Mimamotte'ta kimi wa iu
Ima koko ni iru yo

Itsu made mo kienai omoi o
Tsunagitomerareta shoki shoudou o
Yobisamashite hashiridase
Ano hi no kodou wa
Boku to kimi no naka no uchuu de hibiite iru yo

Misery is nothing
It is all up to your thoughts
And beliefs to bring in success within your life
Don't you compare yourself with other people
That's a waste of person you are so why not be honest to your emotion
Wasurenaide

All the promises made between us
Broke in pieces and turned into sand
Let's escape from this colorless world to find myself
And tomorrow that we liveEmbed Just Awake All That We Have Now Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas hard-rock
