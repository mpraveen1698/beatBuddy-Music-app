I think, I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I’m breaking
Maybe it's in my blood
Got a pain that I can't avoid, I think I’m breaking down

[Verse 1: Brian Burkheiser]
Hate every single second, minute, hour every day
Person in the mirror, they won't let me feel a thing
Keep me focused on my problems, I'm addicted to the pain
Everybody's out to get you

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe]
I guess I never noticed how it came creeping in
My enemy emotion, but I can't sink or swim
I say I'm feeling hopeless, they give me medicine
They give me medicine, they give me medicine

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
I think I think too much (Too much)
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking
Maybe it’s in my blood (My blood)
Got a pain that I can’t avoid, I think I'm breaking
Down, I think I’m breaking
Down, I think I'm breaking
I think I think too much (Too much)
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking down

Lies, every time they ask me, I just tell ’em that I'm fine
Try to hide my demons, but they only multiply
Keep me running from the voices on repeat inside my mind
Everybody fucking hates you

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe]
I guess I never noticed how it came creeping in
My enemy emotion, but I can't sink or swim
I say I'm feeling hopeless, but no one's listening
But no one's listening, but no one's listening

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
I think I think too much (Too much)
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking
Maybe it's in my blood (My blood)
Got a pain that I can't avoid, I think I'm breaking
Down, I think I'm breaking
Down, I think I'm breaking
I think I think too much (Too much)
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking down

[Outro: Brian Burkheiser]
I don't really like myself
I don't really like myself
I don't really like myself
I don't really like myself
I think I'm breaking down12Embed Breaking Down TRAUMA I Prevail metalcore
