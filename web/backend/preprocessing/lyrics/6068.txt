1 ContributorGet You The Moon x Agar Tum Saath Ho LyricsYou gave me a shoulder when I needed it
You showed me love when I wasn't feeling it
You helped me fight when I was giving in
And you made me laugh when I was losing it

'Cause you are, you are
The reason why I'm still hanging on
'Cause you are, you are
The reason why my head is still above water (yeah)

And if I could, I'd get you the moon
And give it to you
And if death was coming for you
I'd give my life for you

Teri nazron mein hai tere sapne
Tere sapno mein hai naraazi
Mujhe lagta hai ke baatein dil ki
Hoti lafzon ki dhokebaazi

Tum saath ho ya na ho kya fark hai
Bedard thi zindagi bedard hai
Agar tum saath ho
Agar tum saath ho
