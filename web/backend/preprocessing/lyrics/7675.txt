20 ContributorsMad About You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Feel the vibe, feel the terror, feel the pain
It's driving me insane
I can't fake for God's sake, why am I
Driving in the wrong lane
Trouble is my middle name
But in the end I'm not too bad
Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad

[Chorus]
About you
Mad about you
Mad

[Verse 2]
Are you the fishy wine that will give me
A headache in the morning
Or just a dark blue landmine
That'll explode without a decent warning
Give me all your true hate
And I'll translate it in our bed
Into never seen passion, never seen passion
Is why I am so mad

[Chorus]
About you
Mad about you
Mad
You might also like[Bridge]
Trouble is your middle name
But in the end you're not too bad
Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad

[Chorus]
About you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad

[Verse 3]
Give me all your true hate
And I'll translate it in our bed
Into never seen passion
That is why I am so mad

[Chorus]
About you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
Mad about you
