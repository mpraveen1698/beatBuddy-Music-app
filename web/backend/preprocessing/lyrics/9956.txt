Somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
Oh oh oh

Somebody's watching me
Tell me it is just a dream

Somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
Oh oh oh

Somebody's watching me

Somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy

Somebody's watching me
Tell me it is just a dream

Somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy

Somebody's watching me
Tell me it is just a dream

Somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
