9 ContributorsUsed to Me Lyrics[Verse:1]
Don't stay up too late
But I gotta let you know that you've been on my mind
Taking a while for me to say it, hope it's fine
And I wouldn't mind if you were taking up my time
So I'll meet you at 8
Whatever you wanna do it's fine by me I swear
Put on the radio and take you anywhere
'Cause I've been tired of only talking when we text
I hope it's mutual cause I think I could get used to this
Wondering If you think you'd get used to me
Now I'm getting nervous like I used to be

[Chorus]
Asking you to say the word and I'll be on the way
(Let's just go talk about it, I got time if you're about it)
If you need me I'll be here to stay
(Let's just go talk about it, I got time just)

[Verse:2]
Don't stay up too late
But If you find yourself awake at 2AM
You can call me up it doesn't matter when
Not gonna lie to you I'll be here anytime
So let's not complicate
Whatever emotions that we're feeling at this time
When we got issues we can solve 'em down the line
And if you feel the same I hope you won't get tired of me
Do my best to offer something new to you
You don't need to doubt that I'll be true to you
You might also like[Chorus]
I promise If you say the word and I'll be on the way
(Let's just go talk about it, I got time if you're about it)
If you need me I'll be here to stay
(Let's just go talk about it, I got time if you're about it)
Say the word and I'll be on the way
(Let's just go talk about it, I got time if you're about it)
If you need me I'll be here to stay
(Let's just go talk about it, I got time if you're about it)2Embed Used to Me Used to Me Luke Chiang chill
