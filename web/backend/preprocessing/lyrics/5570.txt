Fear in me so deep, it gets the best of me
In the fear I fall, here it comes, face to face with me
Here I stand, hold back so no one can see
I feel these wounds, step down, step down
Step down!
Am I breaking down?

[Chorus]
Can I break away?
Push me away, make me fall
Just to see another side of me
Push me away, you can't see
What I see, the other side of me

[Verse 2]
Fall back on me and I’ll be the strength I need
To save me now, just come face to face with me
Stay in place, you'll be the first to see
Me heal these wounds
Step down, step down, step, down! Down!
I’m not breaking, down! Down

[Chorus]
Can I break away?
Push me away, make me fall
Just to see another side of me
Push me away, you can't see
What I see, the other side of me
You might also like[Bridge]
Go!

[Chorus]
Can I break away?
Push me away, make me fall
Just to see another side of me
Push me away, you can't see
What I see, the other side of me

[Outro]
No one can see anything on the other side of me
I walk, I crawl, losing everything and waiting for a downfall
No one can see anything on the other side of me
I walk, I crawl, losing everything on the downfall!
