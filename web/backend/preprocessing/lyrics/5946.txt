6 ContributorsThese Days Lyrics[Intro]
One hunnid

[Chorus]
Yeah, these days I don't take advice from anybody
Who gon' tell me how to do it if they never did it right
These days I don't waste a minute of my time
Reminiscin' on regrets of the past, that's a different life
These days I don't need nobody's validation
These days I don't need nobody's invitation
These days I don't tell nobody what I'm doin'
I just do it if I fail, keep it pushin' 'til I get it right

[Verse]
Yeah, these days I been wide awake, I never sleep late
Got a lot to do, I treat a Sunday like a weekday
Do it for my son, set thе table, I need three plates
Have my cakе and eat it, baby, don't forget the cheesecake
Got it, yeah, they know I got it
Confidence contagious, so the ones around me caught it
Everybody waitin' on me hopin' I'ma drop it
I feel like all this weight is on me, still, I'm never stoppin'
No, that is not an—yeah, pushin' myself to the limit
I set a goal, but still I never feel enough when I get it
'Cause when I go in, all these feelings overflow to the ceilin'
It's like a hole just opened up and I don't know how to fill it
I tell 'em, mm, look, I don't make mistakes, the mistakes made me
Drop songs when I write them, I don't wait eight weeks
They too focused on they image now, but that ain't me
Lotta rats takin' pics, that's why they say "Cheese"
Lately I've been feelin' like there's somethin' off
Lotta friends used to show me love, ain't showin' love at all
Yeah, only cheered me on when I was underdog
Runnin' up the numbers, everybody keep on runnin' off
Funny how they wanted me to win until I passed them
Now all of a sudden they be talkin' in the past tense
"He was this, he was that" like I changed up, hmm
Had a kid, I'm a dad, gotta make funds
These days everybody focused on the "he say" and "she say"
Actin' up and tryna make a scene like a screenplay
Try to be original but end up as a remake
Spend a lot of time thinkin' 'bout how I'ma be great
I just stick to the plan
Yeah, I'm focused on the music, not a pic for the 'Gram
Stay true to my supporters, yes, I did it for them
So even when I get hot, never switch on a fan, mm
