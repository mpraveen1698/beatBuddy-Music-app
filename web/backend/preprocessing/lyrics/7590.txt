20 ContributorsWasted Lyrics[Intro]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to fake it
The only time we really talk
Is when our clothes are coming off
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
You are my glass half empty
Sipping my ocean dry
Emotionally spin me
'Till none of our planets could align
But I could stand you one more night

[Chorus]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah

You are a catch-22, either way I miss out
All of the grief I give you
Is energy I can live without
But I could stand you one more night

[Chorus]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah


[Chorus]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted

Oh woah, woah, woah, woah
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah21Embed Wasted A Town Called Paradise Tiësto;Matthew Koma trance
