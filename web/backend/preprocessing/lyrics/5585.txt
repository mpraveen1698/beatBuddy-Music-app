Looking at the pictures I keep on my shelf
'Cause it's been so long since I've looked like myself
Burn another candle down
Burn another candle down
Running low on patience, running now on fumes
I'm never gonna make it halfway to the moon
But it's too late to turn around
But it's too late to turn around

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm running out of oxygen
I'll never be the same again now
Same again now

[Chorus]
Oh my god, I can't remember
Who I was just last December
What have I done, how did I get here?
What have I done?
Oh my god, look in the mirror
I was young, nothing to fear once
What have I done, how did I get here?
What have I done?

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was foolish, I guess I was naive
I didn't know what I had, and I thought I had to leave
I wish that I was homeward bound
I wish that I was homeward bound
I'm searching for a signal, holding out my phone
Have I gone too far, am I on my own?
No one here to hold me now
No one here to hold me now

I'm running out of oxygen
Can't help but wish I'd stayed
I'm lost just like Will Robinson
A rocket man in space

[Chorus]
Oh my god, I can't remember
Who I was just last December
What have I done, how did I get here?
What have I done?
Oh my god, look in the mirror
I was young, nothing to fear once
What have I done, how did I get here?
What have I done?

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

[Bridge]
Oh my god, I can't remember
Who I was just last December
Who I was just last December
Oh my god
[Chorus]
Oh my god, look in the mirror
I was young, nothing to fear once
What have I done, how did I get here?
What have I done?

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm
