Hey, I'm feeling tired
My time has gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

[Verse 2]
Day is here fading
That's when I'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can't always say
"It's gonna be better tomorrow"
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

[Chorus]
Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming so sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground

(Falling away from me)
It's spinning round and round
(Falling away from me)
It's lost and can't be found
(Falling away from me)
It's spinning round and round
(Falling away from me)
Throw it down

[Chorus]
Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming so sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground

[Interlude]
Twisting me, they won't go away
So I pray, go away

[Bridge]
Life's falling away from me
It's falling away from me
Life's falling away from me
Fuck
[Chorus]
Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming so sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
(Falling away from me)
Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
(Falling away from me)
Down, down
Into the ground
(Falling away from me)
Screaming so sound
Beating me, beating me
(Falling away from me)
Down, down
Into the ground27Embed Falling Away from Me Issues Korn metal
