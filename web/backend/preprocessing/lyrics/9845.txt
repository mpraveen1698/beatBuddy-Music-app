2 Contributors情非得已 Lyrics难以忘记初次见你
It is hard to forget my first encounter of you
一双迷人的眼睛
A pair of charming eyes
在我脑海里 你的身影 挥散不去
In my mind, the memory of your figure is unwavering
握你的双手感觉你的温柔
Holding your hands, feeling your gentleness
真的有点透不过气
There's a slight sense of breathlessness
你的天真 我想珍惜
I want to cherish your innocence
看到你受委屈 我会伤心
Seeing you aggrieved, I will feel sad

只怕我自己会爱上你
I'm afraid that I will fall in love with you
不敢让自己靠得太近
I don't have the courage of being too close to you
怕我没什么能够给你
I'm afraid that I don't have much to give you
爱你也需要很大的勇气
Perhaps loving you requires great courage
只怕我自己会爱上你
I am afraid that I will fall in love with you
也许有天会情不自禁
Perhaps one day, I will be unable to refrain
想念只让自己苦了自己
Yearning (for you) only makes me suffer
爱上你是我情非得已
Loving you is my last resort
