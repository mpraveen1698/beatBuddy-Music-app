We, who exchanged sky-soaring wings
For hands which hold each other
While still being fascinated by the sky
Is it a sin to keep on dreaming?

[Verse 2]
Summer watches autumn's back
And the image of its face comes to mind
Is it longing? Is it loving?
All the while knowing it will never be fulfilled

[Verse 3]
Before passing showers
And light filtering through trees
Long long before they had a name
You've always been you, haven't you?

[Chorus]
Today, when once in a 1000 years gravity falls asleep
Standing in the blind spot of the sun, we leave this star
To a place he can't bring us back from when he opens his eyes
On "three" we kick off the Earth to some other star

[Post-Chorus]
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

A heart in the rush of a summer cold
Makes summer pass by that much quicker
In the midst of a whirlwind scenery
All I could see clearly was you

[Verse 5]
Since the day I met you
Suddenly I'm not seeing dreams at night
Buried, waiting within the soil
The time to fulfil is now

[Chorus]
Today, when once in a 1000 years gravity falls asleep
Riding on the sound of fireworks, we leave this star
To a place he can't bring us back from when he opens his eyes
On "three" we kick off the Earth to some other star
Let's go

[Post-Chorus]
(Just a little farther, beyond destiny)
(Just a little farther, beyond norms)
Let's go
(Just a little farther, beyond destiny)
(Just a little farther)
Let's go
(Just a little farther, beyond destiny)
(Just a little farther, beyond norms)
Let's go
(Just a little farther, beyond destiny)
(Just a little farther)
[Bridge]
We spread our sail to be powered by dreams
To cross the night, for the day to come
Fuelled to the brim by expectations
Knowing it's gonna work out somehow, arm in arm
No way we ain't afraid, but we're not turning back
Anticipating the crises to come, but nothing else we can do
Our love says, our voices say
They say "Go!"Embed Grand Escape (feat. Toko Miura) Weathering With You -Complete Version- RADWIMPS;Toko Miura emo
