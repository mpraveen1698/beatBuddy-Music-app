Wind me up, put me down, start me off, and watch me go
I'll be runnin' circles around you sooner than you know
A little off-center and I'm out of tune
Just kickin' this can along the avenue, but I'm alright

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones

[Chorus]
And you jerk it out, when you jerk it out

[Verse 2]
Shut up, hush your mouth, can't you hear, you talk too loud?
No, I can't hear, nothing 'cause I got my head up in the clouds
I bite off anything that I can chew
I'm chasing cars up and down the avenue, but that's okay

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones

[Chorus]
And you jerk it out

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones

[Chorus]
And you jerk it out

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And you jerk it out
When you jerk it out
You gotta jerk it out
Oh, baby, don't you know you really gotta jerk it out?
When you jerk it out
Oh, baby, don't you know you really gotta jerk it out?
When you jerk it out
Oh, baby, don't you know you really gotta jerk it out?14Embed Jerk It Out Love For The Streets Caesars swedish
