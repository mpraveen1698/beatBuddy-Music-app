E equals mc squared
I got a blimp inside my head
Flew over the cuckoo's nest
The lights are on, but there's no one here
Puffing with the dragons
I'm livin' for the thrill, formula
Screws loose on a Monday
Screws loose, where's the propane?
Screws loose, tell 'em
Screws loose, tell 'em
Screws loose, tell 'em
I'm livin' for the thrill, formula, tell 'em
Puffing with the dragons
Screws loose, tell 'em
I'm livin' for the thrill, formula (Screws loose)
