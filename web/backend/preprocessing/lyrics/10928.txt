It could be a spoonful of diamond
It could be a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Satisfy my soul

[Chorus 1]
Men lies about little
Some of them cries about little
Some of them dies about littles
Everything fight about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that

[Verse 2]
It could be a spoonful of coffee
Could be a spoonful of tea
But a little spoon of your precious love
Good enough for me

[Chorus 2]
Men lies about that
Some of them dies about that
Some of them cries about that
But everything fight about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that ...
You might also like[Verse 3]
It could be a spoonful of water
Save you from the desert sand
But one spoon of lead from 45
Save you from another man

[Chorus 3]
Men lies about that
Some of them cries about that
Some of them dies about that
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that ...3Embed Spoonful Howlin' Wolf Howlin' Wolf acoustic
