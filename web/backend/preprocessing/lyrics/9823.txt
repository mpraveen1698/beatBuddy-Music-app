Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me lovin' all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the current's only pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this?

[Chorus]
'Cause it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won't go

[Verse 2]
I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
Oh, but I'm taking them back
'Cause all this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend, this life we live, it's not what we have
It's what we believe in
You might also like[Chorus]
It's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a will in me and now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won't go, whoa, whoa, oh-oh
I won't go

[Bridge]
There might be more than you believe
There might be more than you believe
There might be more than you can see

[Chorus]
But it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a will in me and now it's gonna show
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh-oh
[Bridge]
There might be more than you believe
There might be more than you believe
And there might be more than you can see

[Outro]
But I won't go
Oh no, I won't go down
