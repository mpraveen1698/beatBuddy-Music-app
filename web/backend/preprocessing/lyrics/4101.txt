3 ContributorsCollide (Acoustic Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
The dawn is breaking
A light shinin' through
You're barely wakin'
But I'm tangled up in you, yeah

[Verse 2]
But I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

[Chorus]
Even the best fall down sometimes
And even the wrong words seem to rhyme
And out of the doubt that fills your mind
I somehow find you and I collide

[Verse 3]
But I'm quiet, you know
You make a first impression
Well, I've found I'm scared to know
I'm always on your mind

[Chorus]
Well, even the best fall down sometimes
And even the stars refuse to shine
And out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find you and I'd collide

Well, don't stop here
And I lost my place
And I'm close behind
I'm close behind

[Chorus]
Well, even the best fall down sometimes
And even the wrong words seem to rhyme
And out of the doubt that fills your mind, yeah
You finally find that you and I'd collide

[Outro]
You finally find that you and I'd collide
You finally find you and I, you and I
Well, I'veâ€”
Well, I've found
You
