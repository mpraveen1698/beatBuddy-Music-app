I got somethin' to say, please don't stop me till I'm done
This isn't me bein' dramatic, God knows this part isn't fun
I didn't drive two full hours just to mess with your head
Listen to me closely, this is our love's dyin' breath

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I tried to be someone else for this love
But, oh, does it feel so strange
'Cause I know my mind won't change

[Chorus]
I miss the old you, but that ain't the whole truth
'Cause, baby, you changed and so have I
You miss the old me, so young, dumb, and happy
But that girl is gone and now it's time
Oh, to kiss me goodbye

[Verse 2]
Every room you walked in, effortlessly you'd shine
I was happy just to be there, watching from the sideline
And this room is on fire, but we're dancing real slow
Can't pretend anymore, even my dad knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I tried to be someone else for this love
But, oh, does it feel so strange
'Cause I know my mind won't change
You might also like[Chorus]
I miss the old you, but that ain't the whole truth
'Cause, baby, you changed and so have I (So have I, so have I, so have I)
You miss the old me, so young, dumb, and happy
But that girl is gone and now it's time
Oh, to kiss me goodbye

[Post-Chorus]
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye

[Outro]
So kiss me goodbyeEmbed Goodbye Goodbye Mimi Webb songwriter
