2 Contributors來自天堂的魔鬼 (Away) Lyrics夜裡做了美麗的惡夢
想清醒我卻抵不過心動
夢裡你是無底的黑洞
我無力抗拒失重

我的意識自控脈搏流動
全被你神秘引力操控
親愛的你是危險的迷宮
我找不到出口

You took my heart away, away‚ away‚ away
My head is blown away‚ away, away, away
你就是傳說來自天堂的魔鬼
You should take my heart away‚ away, away, away‚ away, away, away

拜託別對我細心問候
這是你也不察覺的陰謀
我討厭你無心的微笑
我快無可救藥

你像一個漩渦慢慢讓我
無法抽離一直地墜落
親愛的你是優雅的惡魔
一點一點把我吞沒

You took my heart away, away, away, away
My head is blown away, away, away, away
你就是傳說來自天堂的魔鬼
You should take my heart away, away, away, away, away, away, away

但你是牛頓頭上那顆 若無其事的蘋果

You took my heart away, away, away, away
You took my heart away, away, away, away
You took my heart away, away, away, away
My head is blown away, away, away, away
你就是傳說來自天堂的魔鬼
You should take my heart away, away, away, away, away, away, awayEmbed 來自天堂的魔鬼 新的心跳 G.E.M. mandopop
