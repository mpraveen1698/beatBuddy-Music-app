I'll be good to you
I will keep your tender body next to mine

Why don't you let me lady be good to you
I want to take care of you darlin'
All of your life and make love to you
If you let me baby Oh

Cause I love you darlin'
You're out of this World
Please make love with me

Funk Me Funk Me
Funk Me
OOOh

I need us for me to love
Mother nature taught me love
We don't really have to freak
You just thrill me when you speak

I can see that you're a star
And I like the way you are
Funky music lights my fire
Shakes my body sexified
You might also likeSince we both have lots of love
Send some lovin' up above
Don't give me no added vice
See the love that's in my eyes

All I know is how much I love you Baby
Woo
Aw baby you know that I love you girl
Darlin' I'd like to love you right now
Right now, forever more baby

Watching you over here dancin' on the floor
It makes me want to love you all the more, baby
For when we begin
I know my love for you
Will never never end

Why don't you give me a chance
To prove my romance
I don't know if I can go on without
Having you for my own

Oh father above
Give me this lady to love
So I can love her right now father
All of my love for you to share
Take you, baby, anywhere
I want to love you right now
Hey
Funk me if you got the desire
Funk me if you got the desire
