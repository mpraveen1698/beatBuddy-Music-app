20 ContributorsHigher Ground Lyrics[Verse 1: John Martin]
All this time, all this time keeps fading
Feeling trapped inside
So afraid of the darkness talking
In my mind

[Pre-Chorus: John Martin]
It's been a long time coming
But it wasn't for nothing
Soul searching for something, for something

[Chorus: John Martin]
I'm down on my knees in the dust
I scream from the top of my lungs
I find my way back to a higher ground
Yeah, I just want to feel alive
Deep in my bones
I know I'm not there but I'm close
I'll find my way back to a higher ground
Yeah, I just want to feel alive with you

[Post-Chorus: John Martin]
Yeah, I just want to feel alive with you
Yeah, I just want to feel alive

[Verse 2: John Martin]
Try to speak but my voice keeps breaking
Need to say what's wrong
So many smiles you have seen me faking
On and on

[Outro: John Martin]
Yeah, I just want to feel alive
With you, you, yeah
I just want to feel alive
