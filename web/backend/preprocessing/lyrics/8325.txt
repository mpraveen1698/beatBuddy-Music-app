2 ContributorsIf You Met Me First Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why do you look at me like that?
Your eyes saying things that they can't take back
Feels good, feels right, it don’t help

[Verse 2]
Every night when the quiet gets loud
Hate that I know what you're doin' right now
Your arms around someone else

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every time I’m next to you
I swear that you can feel it too
How long can we do this to ourselves?

[Chorus]
In a different place and time
Maybe in another life
I'll bet that baby you and I would have worked
We never get the chance to try
And what makes it worse
Is you would have loved me
If you met me first

[Verse 3]
I can't even count all the times I've thought
About the line I'd never cross
But I've crossed that line in my head
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can't steal you from somebody else
Just to have you to myself
My heart don't wanna hear me tell the truth

[Chorus]
In a different place and time
Maybe in another life
I’ll bet that baby you and I would have worked
We never get the chance to try
And what makes it worse
Is you would have loved me
If you met me first

[Bridge]
I’m not hangin' on to hope
If you do or if you don’t
I don't ever wanna know for sure

[Chorus]
In a different place and time
Maybe in another life
I'll bet that baby you and I would have worked
We never get the chance to try
And what makes it worse
Is you would have loved me
If you met me first
[Outro]
'Cause you would have loved me
If you met me first
Oh, you would have loved me
If you met me firstEmbed If You Met Me First Eric Ethridge Eric Ethridge country
