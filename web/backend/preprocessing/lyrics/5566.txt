9 Contributors​​airplane thoughts Lyrics[Intro]
I, I-I, I, I-I
I've been thinking about you on this airplane
And my, my mind is in the sky
When I'm dreaming about you on this airplane

[Verse 1]
Could it be the elevation?
Must admit that I'm not used to feeling these sensations
Missing you like crazy though it's barely been a minute
You dropped me to the gate
And bid farewell
Summer in Sevilla
Drinking red sangria by the fountain in the square
Imagine that you're seated with me
That we're flying there
But you're way back where, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I, I-I, I, I-I
I've been thinking about you on this airplanе
And my, my mind is in the sky
When I'm dreaming about you on this airplanе

[Post-Chorus]
On this airplane, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
On this airplane, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

There's no need for entertainment
TV screens be beaming
But you're my preoccupation
Kill the thirteen hours
Rummaging through every brain cell
Memories replaying in my mind
And boy, have you started changing?
Wonder who we'll be
The next time that I see your face
And I get so damn scared
When I think you're gon' outpace me
Think you're gon' replace me, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh (Yeah-hey, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I, I-I (Oh, oh, oh), I, I-I
I've been thinking about you on this airplane
And my, my mind is in the sky (My mind)
When I'm dreaming about you on this airplane

[Post-Chorus]
On this airplane, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
On this airplane, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh1Embed airplane thoughts rapunzel dhruv chill
