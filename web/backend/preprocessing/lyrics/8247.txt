5 ContributorsLove You Like Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
She never calls this late at night, no
But I can tell she's been drinking all night long
She sounds upset, I'm asking, "Baby, where you at?
I called you earlier but you ain't hit me back"
She's breaking down, I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm screaming, "Who the fuck were you with?"
I grab my keys, "You better tell me where you at"
She said she fucked up but there's no taking it back

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave everything to you
And this is what you turn around and do
Did he have all, all that you wanted
For you to go and break your promise

[Chorus]
I wanna know
Every secret you've been hiding
I wanna know
Just how long have you been lying?
I wanna know
Does he fuck you like I did?
I wanna know
And will he love you like I did?
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
He won't do you like me
He won't love you like me, baby
He won't touch you like me
He won't love you like me, baby
He won't fuck you like me
He won't love you like me, baby
He won't love you like me
He won't love you like me
I wanna know

[Verse 2]
Girl, this ain't how it's supposed to be
Dancing between someone else's sheets
I can't believe that this is really happening
Your guilty conscious is gon' be the death of me
You got so caught up in the moment
But he'll only love you when he's lonely
This ain't no game, you better tell me where you at
No, girl, you fucked up, and there's no taking it back

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave everything to you
And this is what you turn around and do
Did he have all, all that you wanted
For you to go and break your promise
[Chorus]
I wanna know
Every secret you've been hiding
I wanna know
Just how long have you been lying?
I wanna know
Does he fuck you like I did?
I wanna know
And will he love you like I did?

[Post-Chorus]
He won't do you like me
He won't love you like me, baby
He won't touch you like me
He won't love you like me, baby
He won't fuck you like me
And he won't love you like me, baby
He won't love you like me
He won't love you like me
I wanna know

[Outro]
(I gave everything to you)
I gave everything to you
(And this is what you turn around and do)
Oh, baby
(Did he have all, all that you wanted)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-oh-yeah
(For you to go and break your promise)
