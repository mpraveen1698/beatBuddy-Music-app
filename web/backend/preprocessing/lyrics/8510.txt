11 ContributorsGlorious Day (Live) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was buried beneath my shame
Who could carry that kind of weight
It was my tomb
Till I met You

[Verse 2]
I was breathing but not alive
All my failures I tried to hide
It was my tomb
Till I met You

[Chorus]
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day

[Verse 3]
Now Your mercy has saved my soul
Now Your freedom is all I know
The old made new
Jesus, when I met You

You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day

[Bridge]
I needed rescue
My sin was heavy
But chains break at the weight of Your glory
I needed shelter
I was an orphan
Now You call me a citizen of heaven
When I was broken
You were my healing
Your love is the air that I'm breathing
I have a future
My eyes are open

[Chorus]
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day1Embed Glorious Day - Live Worthy Of Your Name (Live) Passion;Kristian Stanfill world-music
