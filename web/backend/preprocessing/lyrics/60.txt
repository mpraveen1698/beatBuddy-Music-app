20 ContributorsWhere Are You Now Lyrics[Intro: Calum Scott]
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head

[Verse 1: Calum Scott]
Five days on the freeway, ridin' shotgun with you (Yeah, yeah)
Two hearts in the fastlane, we had big dreams in blue (Yeah, yeah)
Playin' "Sweet Child of Mine" and I still feel that line
Where are you now? Where are you now?

[Chorus: Calum Scott]
Hey, it's been too long, too long ago, my love
Where did we go wrong? Too late to turn around
Where are you now? Where are you now?
Hey, it's been too long

[Post-Chorus: Calum Scott]
You're just like my favoritе song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my hеad
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head

[Refrain: Calum Scott]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Where are you now?)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, it's been too long

Some days I can feel it, but the feelin' ain't all blue (Yeah, yeah)
You got me believin', one day you gotta come through (Yeah, yeah)
Lost in these city lights 'cause I can't sleep tonight
Where are you now? Where are you now?

[Chorus: Calum Scott]
Hey, it's been too long, too long ago, my love
Where did we go wrong? Too late to turn around
Where are you now? Where are you now?
Hey, it's been too long

[Post-Chorus: Calum Scott]
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head

[Refrain: Calum Scott]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Where are you now? Where are you now?
Where are you now? Where are you now?
