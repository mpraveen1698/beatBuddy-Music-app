I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, hmm

[Verse 1]
Well, at first I thought I'd have to bear this weight by myself
But when my knees were getting weak and I was in need of help
You were there to take away the pain that I felt, mmh

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only one that gave me hope
You're the only one who really knows

[Chorus]
I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, hmm

[Verse 2]
For a moment, I thought maybe I was doing alright
So I took your love for granted and I left you behind
I just didn't understand you were what kept me alive, hmm

You forgave me, and you gave me hope
Still, you're the only one who really knows

[Chorus]
I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, hmm

[Bridge]
It's you, you pull me through it on the days when I have doubts
Even when I turned my back on you, you never let me down
And even when I hit the bottom, no, you didn't let me drown
Oh, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, hmm
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, hmm15Embed Demons These Two Windows Alec Benjamin electro
