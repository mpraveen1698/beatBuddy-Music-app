1 ContributorLost In Between Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, I'm lost in between and I don't know what to feel
Yeah, my heart is rather sore and my lungs don't work no more
Yeah, I want you to hurt me 'cause I'd rather feel low
Than to feel nothing at all, yeah, I feel nothing at all

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm lost in between and I don't know what to feel
Yeah, my heart is rather sore and my lungs don't work no more
Yeah, I want you to hurt me 'cause I'd rather feel low
Than to feel nothing at all, yeah, I feel nothing at all

[Verse]
It feels like I'm falling down, it feels like I left the ground
And I don't know where to go
I'm staring at the stars and wonder where you are, yeah
Are you looking down on me?

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm lost in between and I don't know what to feel
Yeah, my heart is rather sore and my lungs don't work no more
Yeah, I want you to hurt me 'cause I'd rather feel low
Than to feel nothing at all, yeah, I feel nothing at all
Oh, I'm lost in between and I don't know what to feel
Yeah, my heart is rather sore and my lungs don't work no more
Yeah, I want you to hurt me 'cause I'd rather feel low
Than to feel nothing at all, yeah, I feel nothing at allYou might also likeEmbed Lost In Between Lost In Between yaeow sad
