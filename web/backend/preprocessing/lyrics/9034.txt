It's not fair, yeah I know
I just wish I could be there with you
Yeah, it's not fair, yeah I know
I just wish I could be there with you but I can't

[Verse 1: yaeow]
I just wanna scream back at the world
I just wanna leave but it makes things worst
I just wanna hate you
But I can't, no I can't, no I can't

Did you even care when I was gone?
I just wanna hate you
But I can't, no I can't, no I can't

But it don't make sense
'Cause we argue all the time
Baby it's about time that we go
And start over
Yeah we got a lot of love but it don't make sense
It's a pain in my chest, I just wanna see you again
But maybe it's for the best

[Chorus: yaeow]
It's not fair, yeah I know
I just wish I could be there with you
Yeah, it's not fair, yeah I know
I just wish I could be there with you but I can't
