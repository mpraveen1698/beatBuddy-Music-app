Guess we started a fire, now the bedroom is burning
Can we put it out?
'Cause we're both saying things that we're gonna regret when
Every word's too loud

[Pre-Chorus: SHY Martin]
We gotta slow, slow, slow down
Gotta lay low, low, low now
Yeah, we should go, go, go now
'Cause things are always better
Things are always better

[Chorus: SHY Martin]
When you call me back in a little
When the dust starts to settle
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine
Don't be scared if we're falling
It hurts less in the morning
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine

[Post-Chorus: SHY Martin]
To keep me yours and keep you mine

There's a cloud in this room and I can't cut the tension
'Cause we lost the knife
In the mountain of dishes that none of us mention
We eat out at night

[Pre-Chorus: SHY Martin]
We gotta slow, slow, slow down
Gotta lay low, low, low now
Yeah, we should go, go, go now
'Cause things are always better
Things are always better

[Chorus: SHY Martin]
When you call me back in a little
When the dust starts to settle
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine
Don't be scared if we're falling
It hurts less in the morning
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine

[Post-Chorus: SHY Martin]
To keep me yours and keep you mine
Call me back in a little
When the dust starts to settle
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine4Embed Keep You Mine Keep You Mine NOTD;shy martin house
