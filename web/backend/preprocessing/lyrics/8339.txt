Wrap me in a bolt of lightning
Send me on my way still smiling
Maybe that's the way I should go
Straight into the mouth of the unknown
I left the spare key on the table
Never really thought I'd be able
To say I merely visit on the weekends
I lost my whole life and a dear friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I've said it so many times
I would change my ways, no, never mind
God knows I've tried

[Chorus]
Call me a sinner, call me a saint
Tell me it's over, I'll still love you the same
Call me your favorite, call me the worst
Tell me it's over, I don't want you to hurt

[Post-Chorus]
It's all that I can say
So I'll be on my way

[Verse 2]
I finally put it all together
But nothin' really lasts forever
I had to make a choice that was not mine
I had to say goodbye for the last time
I kept my whole life in a suitcase
Never really stayed in one place
Maybe that's the way it should be
You know I live my life like a gypsy

I've said it so many times

[Chorus]
Call me a sinner, call me a saint
Tell me it's over, I'll still love you the same
Call me your favorite, call me the worst
Tell me it's over, I don't want you to hurt

[Post-Chorus]
It's all that I can say
So I'll be on my way

[Bridge]
I'll always keep you inside
You healed my heart and my life
And you know I tried

[Chorus]
Call me a sinner, call me a saint
Tell me it's over, I'll still love you the same
Call me your favorite, call me the worst
Tell me it's over, I don't want you to hurt
[Post-Chorus]
It's all that I can say
So I'll be on my way

[Outro]
So I'll be on my way
So I'll be on my way24Embed Call Me The Sound of Madness Shinedown grunge
