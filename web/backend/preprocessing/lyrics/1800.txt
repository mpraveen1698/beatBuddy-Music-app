2 ContributorsDead to Me (Slow + Reverb) Lyrics[Intro]
It's like I woke up from a nightmare
It's like I woke up from a nightmare

[Chorus]
It's like I woke up from a nightmare
Because I finally got away from you
And I ain't ever going back there
If it's the last thing I'll ever do
But now it's R.I.P
Because it's over and you're dead to me
You're just a memory, that I can't break
No, I can't shake, the ghost that you left behind here

R.I.P. you're dead to me

[Verse 1]
Riddle me this, when is it you decided to turn into a bitch?
We usеd to be lower than them, anybody that knеw us would admit
Then you suddenly switched, yeah, you suddenly switched
In all of my years, I never seen someone corrupted so quick
Lately I'm feelin' like I'm being haunted by all of these demons that I got inside of me
Deep in my arteries, don't even know the reason or pathology
Fuck it, I feel like I'm ready to blow, if I'm ready to blow then call it a wrap (Call it a wrap!)
You can have all my shit, if it means that I see you I don't want it back
You might also like[Chorus]
It's like I woke up from a nightmare
Because I finally got away from you
And I ain't ever going back there
If it's the last thing I'll ever do (Like, fuck that!)
But now it's R.I.P
Because it's over and you're dead to me
You're just a memory, that I can't break
No, I can't shake, the ghost that you left behind here

But now it's R.I.P
Because it's over and you're dead to me
You're just a memory, that I can't break
No, I can't shake, the ghost that you left behind here

R.I.P. you're dead to me

[Verse 2]
I'm in the deep end, I think I'm sinking
And I've been suffocating, struggling just to breathe in
I feel like I been tryna get away forever now
I'm just tryna run away and go wherever now
Uh, 'cause I don't hear you, you're in my rear view
Catch the exhaust up out my vehicle (Skrrr)
I feel like I've been waitin' for this day forever now
And that wherever you may be, I hope you're never found1Embed Dead To Me - Slow + Reverb Dead To Me Slow + Reverb Whales;Fraxo;Lox Chatterbox edm
