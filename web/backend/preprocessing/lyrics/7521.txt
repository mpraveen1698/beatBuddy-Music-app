4 ContributorsTold You So Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wanna say that I miss you
But I don't wanna need to
Be the one to hold on for too longest time
I don't know, I don't need to
Be so cold when I'm with you
But I know you don't want me not asking why

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you told me so
Used to say we'd never work
Say we'd never work it out
But for all we know
I could be the one you want
Singing breathing off
At the top of our lungs at 4am
Baby, why don't we play pretend?
So I can carry you home again
Not as friends, would you go

[Chorus]
If I told you so
If I told you so

[Verse 2]
Wanna say, "I don't miss you"
But I don't wanna lie to you
All my days go to waste 'cause I wasted time
You should know that I tried to
[?]
But I know you don't want me not asking why
If you don't want this you gotta go
Don't wanna leave you
Don't wanna leave you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you told me so
Used to say we'd never work
Say we'd never work it out
But for all we know
I could be the one you want
Singing breathing off
At the top of our lungs at 4am
Baby, why don't we play pretend?
So I can carry you home again
Not as friends, would you go

[Chorus]
If I told you so
If I told you so

[Outro]
Don't wanna leave you
Don't wanna leave youEmbed Told You So Told You So Mike Perry;Orange Villa swedish
