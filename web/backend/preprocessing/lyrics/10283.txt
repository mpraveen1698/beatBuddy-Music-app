Focus on my insides
Doctor says I'm alright
Gotta keep it locked tight
If I'm gonna survive
Don't know what to tell you
Suffer through the volume
Maybe I'm a fool but
I can't wrap my mind around why

[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of the fear in waves
Suffocating in cellophane
Somebody put me away
Put me away before I break

[Chorus]
I'll take another hit to the backbone
I'm picking up the heat like an atom bomb
No time on the clock, it's a bloodshot
Three, two, one
You got me bloodshot
I'll take another hit to the backbone
I'm picking up the heat like an atom bomb
No time on the clock, it's a bloodshot
Three, two, one
You got me bloodshot

Maybe I'm a good guy
Standing on the wrong side
Maybe I'm a sweetheart
Tryna make my own scars
Don't know what it looks like
Just know what it feels like
Scared to let it outside
Scared of what I just might find

[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of my fear in waves
Suffocating in cellophane
Somebody put me away
Put me away before I break

[Chorus]
I'll take another hit to the backbone
I'm picking up the heat like an atom bomb
No time on the clock, it's a bloodshot
Three, two, one
You got me bloodshot
I'll take another hit to the backbone
I'm picking up the heat like an atom bomb
No time on the clock, it's a bloodshot
Three, two, one
You got me bloodshot
[Bridge]
You're breaking me, breaking me down
I'll let it all out
Oh, you're breaking me, breaking me down
I'll let it all out
You got me bloodshot
You got me bloodshot

[Chorus]
I'll take another hit to the backbone
I'm picking up the heat like an atom bomb
No time on the clock, it's a bloodshot
Three, two, one
You got me bloodshot
I'll take another hit to the backbone
I'm picking up the heat like an atom bomb
No time on the clock, it's a bloodshot
Three, two, one
You got me bloodshot1Embed Bloodshot Warplanes Sam Tinnesz blues
