I ain't that cool, a little fucked in the head
They'll be hangin' me quick when I'm back from the dead
Get the rope, get the rope
Get the rope, get the rope
I'm a punk rock kid, I came from hell with a curse
She tried to pray it away, so I fucked her in church
Don't you know? Don't you know?
Don't you know? Yeah, don't you know?

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
They say, "You're not safe here if I stay
With a knife that sharp, no way"

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
No, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at thе mess we started
Oh no, I lеave the broken hearts this way (This way)
Whatcha say? (Whatcha say?) Wanna play?

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Yeah, don't be fooled, I'm only lettin' you down
They pursued me on foot, but I hid in the crowd
Like a ghost, like a ghost
Like a ghost, like a ghost
The seats of my car are filled with cigarette burns
I got a fire in my eye, a little blood on my shirt
Let's hit the road, hit the road
Hit the road, hit the road
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I know there's a special place in hell
That my friends and I know well
There's a perfect place to go
When it's time to lose control

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
No, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at the mess we started
Oh no, I leave the broken hearts this way (This way)
Whatcha say? (Whatcha say?) Wanna play?

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus & Tom DeLonge]
Nightmare, daydream (No, oh no, oh no, oh no)
You can't save me (Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
No way, no, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at the mess we started
Oh no, I leave the broken hearts this way (Shit)
Oh no, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at the mess we started
Oh no, I leave the broken hearts this way
Whatcha say? Everyday, it's a waste, wanna play?5Embed EDGING EDGING blink-182 punk-rock
