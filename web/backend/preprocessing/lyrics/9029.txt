2 ContributorsDo Not Let Me Go LyricsThere are moments in this life when you can't fake it
There are moments I would walk another road
There was something in the broken way you said it
Singing, "Please, oh God, do not let me go."
From the moment I was born I have been dying
Yeah, we walk along towards the great unknown
Is it love if I have given up on trying?
Singing, "Oh my God, don't leave me alone."
Singing, "Please, oh God, do not let me go."
Oh, oh, oh
If you're up there could you lift my heavy burden?
'Cause I cannot seem to make this on my own
Though I'm not sure you can hear me I'm still begging
Singing, "Oh my God, don't leave me alone."
Singing, "Please, oh God, do not let me go."You might also likeEmbed Do Not Let Me Go Where The Mountain Meets The Valley Joshua Hyslop acoustic
