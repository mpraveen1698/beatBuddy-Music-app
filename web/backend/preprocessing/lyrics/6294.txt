Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yes
D-D-Daytrip took it to 10, hey

[Chorus: 88 Camino]
Hey, I feel like Lil Boat with the ice
I want Ferragamo, I want ice
Super thick her thighs, supersize
Super thick her thighs, supersize
New Patek alright, yeah, alright
New Patek alright, yeah, alright
Super thick her thighs, supersize
Super thick her thighs, super

[Verse 1: Derek Wise]
Yeah, first I fuck the bitch, uh, then I park my car, yeah
Even with the clouds, we still layin' under stars, yeah
Ain't used to bein' home, ain't seen my bedroom in a while (No)
Rather be out on the road makin' figures, ask me how (Yeah)
All the years I scraped the plate, can't afford to fuck around
All the losses took to date, I deserve the bustdown
Money pilin' show to show, gettin' hard for me to count
Yeah, I pulled up with my slime, 666, that be the town
Yeah, catch me in the field, Sammy Sosa in his prime
Gucci print on my shirt, it look different, hard to find
Walkin' up from the Saks with the fifth, I'll blow they mind
If it ever go to trial, already know I'll beat the time (Yeah)
Mama said I'll be great, take your blessings as a sign
Vacay to Amalfi Coast, smokin' Cubans, sippin' fine
And that's XO on my chain, forty pointers on my link
Last year this shit was different, used to go out, count my drinks

[Verse 2: 88 Camino]
Diamonds hit your face like Stevie, yeah, I make 'em go blind (Make me go blind)
Came from outer space like ET, yeah, I'm 'bout to go live
It's good for her stomach like green tea, yeah, so I hit from behind (So I hit from behind)
Upgrade from SI to the VV, yeah, it only takes time
All of my bubble gum dreams, we gon' see in real life
Baby girl suck me to sleep but I ain't layin' no pipe (Yeah-ah)
Fuckin' that bitch 'til she get scoliosis, she say I show no emotion (Yeah-ah)
Line up the horse in the stable, I park the Porsche at the Staple, ayy (Oh)

[Bridge: 88 Camino]
Streets, best be back before dark
Streets, where a rat is a shark
I can't move these grams all the time
(I-I can't move these grams all the time)
