7 ContributorsI Want More Lyrics[Verse 1]
This didn't go as I planned
I let the waves bury my feet into the sand
Hand in hand, we're walking in this foreign land

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh
What a beautiful night in my paradise
When I'm with you
I'm feeling so high
The way that you smile made me realize

[Drop]
I want more, I want more
I need you for life, life
Not only for tonight, yeah
I want more, I want more
I need you for life, life
Not only for tonight, yeah

[Verse 2]
We've got a few hours left
And baby, I'm starting to wish
That we never met
'Cause I cannot forget
I cannot get you out of my head
You might also like[Chorus]
Ah-ooh
What a beautiful night in my paradise
When I'm with you
I'm feeling so high
Thе way that you smile made me rеalize

[Drop]
I want more, I want more
I need you for life, life
Not only for tonight, yeah
I want more, I want more
I need you for life, life
Not only for tonight, yeahEmbed I Want More I Want More Marc Benjamin edm
