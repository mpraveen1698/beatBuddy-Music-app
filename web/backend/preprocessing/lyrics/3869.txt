5 ContributorsFlashbacks Lyrics[Verse 1]
I thought that mom and dad were 'sposed to last forever
Like they promised at the altar in Alabama
They were young, in love, and didn't know any better
Yeah, they planned to start a family there together

[Pre-Chorus]
Things they changed when you walked away
You left me wondering if you ever cared
I wish you stayed but I'll be okay
'Cause I learned from you that life's not always fair

[Chorus]
I've been getting flashbacks
Of hearing you fight behind the door
Know you'll never call back
I don't even miss you anymore
'Cause I've been doing fine
Without you in my life
I've been getting flashbacks
I've been getting flashbacks

[Verse 2]
Driving down the highway to the schoolyard
And you'd tell me stories 'bout when you were young
You used to be my hero, then you put up your guard
I used to be so proud to be your son
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Things they changed when you walked away
It's funny how the table's gone and turned
From 4 to 3, when we go out to eat
And momma's sitting by herself again

[Chorus]
I've been getting flashbacks
Of hearing you fight behind the door
Know you'll never call back
I don't even miss you anymore
'Cause I've been doing fine
Without you in my life
I've been getting flashbacks
I've been getting flashbacks

[Bridge]
Now I know
How not to treat the loved ones I outgrow
Take me home
Before we got caught in the undertow

[Chorus]
I've been getting flashbacks
Of hearing you fight behind the door
Know you'll never call back
I don't even miss you anymore
'Cause I've been doing fine
Without you in my life
I've been getting flashbacks
I've been getting flashbacks
[Outro]
Driving down the highway to the schoolyard
And you'd tell me stories 'bout when you were young
You used to be my hero, then you put up your guard
I used to be so proud to be your son2Embed Flashbacks Flashbacks Zach Hood songwriter
