It's taken a lifetime to lose my way
A lifetime of yesterdays
All the wasted time on my hands
Turns to sand and fades in the wind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Crossing lines, small crimes
Taking back what is mine

[Chorus]
I'm fine in the fire
I feed on the friction
I'm right where I should be
Don't try and fix me
I'm fine in the fire
I feed on the friction
I'm right where I should be
Don't try and fix me

[Verse 2]
So lost for so long to find to my way
I failed to follow, I'm out of place

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Crossing lines, small crimes
Taking back what is mine

I feed on the friction

I'm fine in the fire
I feed on the friction

Don't try and fix me
I'm fine in the fire
