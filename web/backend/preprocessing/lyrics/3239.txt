1 ContributorCourtside Lyrics[Verse 1]
You walk into a room
Like you're burning down the west coast
And I can't find
What's left of my mind
You danced, you drank cheap wine
And spilled it on your red coat
But you laughed it off
You don't even blush

[Chorus]
Wanna wake up by you
With a courtside view
You're out of my league
But you're in my room
(Don't let me let go)
(Don't let me let go)
Wanna wake up by you
With a courtside view
You're out of my league
But you're in my room
(Don't let me let go)
(Don't let me let go)

[Verse 2]
Tequila on my lips
Suddenly I'm tongue-tiеd
And I can't find
What's left of my mind
I swore love off sincе I turned sixteen
I wanna hold you and tear at the seam
If you're down
If you're down, down, down
You might also like[Chorus]
Wanna wake up by you
With a courtside view
You're out of my league
But you're in my room
(Don't let me let go)
(Don't let me let go)
Wanna wake up by you
With a courtside view
You're out of my league
But you're in my room
(Don't let me let go)
(Don't let me let go)Embed Courtside Courtside Tim Atlas soul
