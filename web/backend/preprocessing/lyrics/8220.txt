3 ContributorsI Need U Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm the boy in the movie scene
Who just wants to leave
And never come back
And you're the perfect company
You got dreams like me
Please can you take me away?

[Chorus]
So let me ri-, ri-, ri-, ri-, ride away with you
Into the dark, into my heart, I'll follow you
Let me ri-, ri-, ri-, ri-, ride away with you
'Cause all of my scars are broken inside and I need you

[Post-Chorus]
I need you, need you, need you
I need you, need you, need you

[Verse 2]
I see myself in you, the same shape of blue
But I'm not as strong
Yeah, I see the pain you carry
And I wanna be there for you, oh

[Chorus]
So let me ri-, ri-, ri-, ri-, ride away with you
Into the dark, into my heart, I'll follow you
Let me ri-, ri-, ri-, ri-, ride away with you
'Cause all of my scars are broken inside and I need you

I need you, need you, need you
I need you, need you, need you

[Outro]
So let me ri-, ri-, ri-, ri-, ride away with you
Into the dark, into my heart, I'll follow you
Let me ri-, ri-, ri-, ri-, ride away with you
'Cause all of my scars are broken inside and I need you3Embed I Need U Worn Out Heart yaeow sad
