9 ContributorsOuterspace Lyrics[Verse]
Falling in quickly
Tell me you feel something too
Caught in the moment
I'm lost here without you

[Pre-Chorus]
Tangled up in your web (Web)
Holding on to every word you said
I'm ready, I know
I'm hoping it shows (It shows)
Would you say the same?
We're falling from outer space

[Chorus]
We're moving like a full pace supernova
We're making all the headlines now
And I just wanna seize the moment
'Cause we won't ever slow it down
Kissing in the rain
Taste just like champagne
Balling everyday
We're falling from outer space
Hoping time won't change
Got love on my brain
Would you say the same?
We're falling from outer space

We're falling from outer space
We're falling from outer space
