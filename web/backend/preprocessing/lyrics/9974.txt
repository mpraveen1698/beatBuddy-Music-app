4 ContributorsAdidas & Pearls Lyrics[Intro]
There's something in the water

[Verse 1]
She’s flashing pearls and Adidas
Only turned eighteen last weekend
And she truly believes that
She's got time on her side
And now it's four in the morning
And her friend’s in the store
And they took turns in calling
Her higher state of mind

[Verse 2]
She's feeling electric, baby
Check in the mirror now
She's about to break some hearts
Gonna face it now, baby
One of them passing rounds
Suddenly it all goes dark

[Drop]
Therе's something in the water
Shе's just somebody's girl in Adidas and pearls
But there's something in the water
She doesn't need your help
In tryna lose yourself
Have a little patience with yourself
You’re not a racehorse, darling
There’s something in the water
She's just somebody’s daughter

There's something in the water

[Verse 2]
She's feeling electric, baby
Check in the mirror now
She’s about to break some hearts
Gonna face it now, baby
One of them passing rounds
Suddenly it all goes dark

[Chorus]
There's something in the water
She's just somebody's girl in Adidas and pearls
But there's something in the water
She doesn't need your help
In tryna lose yourself
Have a little patience with yourself
You're not a racehorse, darling
There's something in the water

[Drop]
There's something in the water
She doesn't need your help
In tryna lose yourself
Have a little patience with yourself
You're not a racehorse, darling
There's something in the water
She's just somebody's daughterEmbed Adidas & Pearls Adidas & Pearls Solardo;Vintage Culture;LOWES deep-house
