I'll say whatever you want, but I've become such a liar
I used to follow my gut, but now I'm just gettin' higher
It's been a couple of months since I turned to something violent
I should be happier now, so why do I feel this quiet?

[Chorus]
Now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinkin' way too loud
I wish that I could block me out
I wish that I could block me out, out

[Verse 2]
I think I'm burnin' alive, but nobody sees the fire
'Cause when I open my mouth, I seem to be stuck in silence
And I thought of leavin' tonight, but I couldn't drive this tired
Plus, after all this time, I should be a pretty crier

[Chorus]
And now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinkin' way too loud
I wish that I could block me out
Don't know how they see me now
Feelin' lost in every crowd
I feel ten feet off the ground
I wish that I could block me out

And in my head, I make a mess of it
I'm gettin' tired of feelin' delicate
I look around to find it desolate
I used to try, but nothing's helpin' it
And in my head, I make a mess of it
I'm gettin' tired of feelin' delicate
I look around to find it desolate
I used to try, but nothing's helpin' it
Mmm

[Verse 3]
Wish I were heavier now, I'm floatin' outside my body
It's not their fault, but I've found that none of my friends will call me
Until I'm left to myself, it's honestly kind of funny
How every voice in my head is tryin' its best to haunt me

[Chorus]
'Cause now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinkin' way too loud
I wish that I could block me out
Don't know how they see me now
Feelin' lost in every crowd
I feel ten feet off the ground
I wish that I could block me out, out, out
I wish that I could block me out, mmm
I wish that I could block me out6Embed Block me out Block me out Gracie Abrams indie-pop
