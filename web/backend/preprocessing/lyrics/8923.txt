3 ContributorsRain, Rain, Go Away (Songs From the Netflix Series) LyricsRain, rain, go away
Come again another day
We want to go outside and play
Rain, rain, go away

Step right up to the Green Family Fair
Huh?
Do you have your ticket?

When it starts to rain outside
Means we have more fun inside
Can't believe it's finally time
For the Green Family Fair
What's that?
The greatest fair to come to town
You can go even when there's clouds
Turn that frown upside down
At the Green Family Fair
Well okay, but I'll keep checking

Rain, rain, go away
Come again another day
We want to go outside and play
Rain, rain, go away

Well, what is there to do at the Green Family Fair?
Oh, I'm glad you asked
You might also likeLots of fun, lots of gamеs
Yummy snacks for while you play
Oh, it's such a fun packed day
At the Green Family Fair
Thеy've got a new fancy ride
Step right up, you can try
Hop on in and hold on tight
At the Green Family Fair

Are you ready for your first ever ride on the Daddycoaster?
Ready, Daddy

Rain, rain, go away
Come again another day
We want to go outside and play
Rain, rain, go away

Hey look, the rain stopped
You're right
Do you want to go to the Coco Fair now?
Uh-uh, I want to stay at the Green Family Fair
And ride in the Daddycoaster again
You do? Well, hold on tight 'cause here we go
Yay

Rain, rain, it's okay
It's okay to rain today
I can stay inside and play
Rain, rain, it's okay
Rain, rain, it's okay
It's okay to rain today
I can stay inside and play
Rain, rain, it's okayEmbed Rain Rain Go Away CoComelon Kids Hits, Vol. 4 CoComelon children
