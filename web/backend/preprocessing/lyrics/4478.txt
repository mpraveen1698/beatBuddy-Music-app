It's hard
It's okay
Ha-ha, yeah

[Chorus]
It's okay
I guess you're back to your ways again
I'm back in my place
Place that I'll call my brain (It's hard)

[Verse]
Young nigga, selling love like it's drugs for you (It's drugs)
Young nigga, gave my all, wasn't enough for you (Wasn't enough)
Kind of funny 'cause my all was way too much for you (Too much)
Went through the dirt and the dust for you, uh-uh-uh (The dust)
I was afraid, afraid of being on my own
I was afraid, afraid of being all alone
I was afraid, afraid to walk this road
Alone with no hand to hold
How you did me how you did? It's beyond me (Beyond me)
I can see, you don't wanna feel no things (Ayy)
You at home alone poppin' edamames (Beans, beans)
Yeah, and I peep the scars on your body
I see the dirt on your laundry
I see the skeletons all in your closet
I see the tears that drip like a faucet
I see thе fear that stop you from loving
That's why you won't call me
And I ain't pressеd
Yeah, okay, I'm pressed
I wish you the best
I fuckin' guess
You might also like[Chorus]
It's okay
I guess you're back to your ways again
I'm back in my place
Place that I'll call my brain

[Outro]
It's okay
It's okay
It's okay
It's okay1Embed IT'S OK 82 Daniyel sad
