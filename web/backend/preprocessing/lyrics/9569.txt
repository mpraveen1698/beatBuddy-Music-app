Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mist, of pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you

[Verse 2]
Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air
Secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words

[Chorus]
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you

[Verse 3]
You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there, under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time
You might also like[Chorus]
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you

[Bridge]
Say you'll l-love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always
And everywhere and every
Say you'll l-love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always
And everywhere and every
Say you'll l-love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always
And everywhere and every
Say you'll l-love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always
And everywhere and everything
[Chorus]
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you7Embed I Love You Always Forever I Love You Always Forever Betty Who electro
