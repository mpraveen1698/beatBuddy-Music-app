2 ContributorsAtlantis (Extra Sped Up Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
The birds have left their trees
The light pours onto me
I can feel you lying there all on your own
We got here the hard way
All those words that we exchange
Is it any wonder things get broke?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause in my heart and in my head
I'll never take back the things I said
So high above, I feel it coming down
She said, "In my heart and in my head
Tell me why this has to end
Oh, no, oh, no"

[Chorus]
I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We build it up to pull it down

[Verse 2]
Now all the birds have fled
The hurt just lеaves me scared
Losing еverything I've ever known
It's all become too much
Maybe I'm not built for love
If I knew that I could reach you, I would go
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It's in my heart and in my head
You can't take back the things you said
So high above, I feel it coming down
She said, "In my heart and in my head
Tell me why this has to end
Oh, no, oh, no"

[Chorus]
I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We build it up to pull it down

[Bridge]
And we build it up and we build it up
And we build it up to pull it down
And we build it up and we build it up
And we build it up to pull it down

[Chorus]
I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We build it up to pull it downEmbed Atlantis - Extra Sped Up Version Atlantis Seafret folk
