If I could go, go into my heart
And search for all the places I left the spark
To find a way, way back to the olden days
Before it started fallin' apart

[Verse 1]
Singin' songs and tellin' stories
About when we were young
Running crazy through the memories
When we never could be wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
We would be strong like superheroes, high on sugar
We would stay up all night until the sun comes up, yeah
Runnin' crazy through the memories
Innocent and young

[Chorus]
If I could go, go into my heart
And search for all the places I left the spark
To find a way, way back to the olden days
Before it started fallin' apart
I might find it waitin' in the corner
Somewhere in the dark
If I could go, go to where it all began
Yes, I would take it back to the start

Back to the start
Back to the start

[Verse 2]
A little lazy, it was always easy
But we were movin' on
Endless daydreams as far as they see
Of what we might become

[Pre-Chorus]
We would be strong like superheroes, high on sugar
We would stay up all night until the sun comes up, yeah
Runnin' crazy through the memories
Innocent and young

[Chorus]
If I could go, go into my heart
And search for all the places I left the spark
To find a way, way back to the olden days
Before it started fallin' apart
I might find it waitin' in the corner
Somewhere in the dark
If I could go, go to where it all began
Yes, I would take it back to the start
[Post-Chorus]
Back to the start (Start, start)
Back to the start (Start, start)

[Outro]
I might find it waitin' in the corner
Somewhere in the dark
If I could go, go to where it all began
Yes, I would take it back to the start
Back to the start (Start, start; take us back to the start)
Back to the start (Start, start; oh, back to the start)
