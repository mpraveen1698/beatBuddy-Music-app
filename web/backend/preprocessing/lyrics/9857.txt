12 ContributorsArmy Lyrics[Verse 1: Neoni]
Seeing monsters out your window
I know you can't sleep, you pretend though
You don't have to play the hero
'Cause I got you, like you got me
When the earth shakes
When the bombs scream
'Til our last breath, every heartbeat

[Pre-Chorus: Neoni]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You know I'll come running
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Neoni]
If you go to war then I'm going with you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Pick up my sword, yeah, there's nothing I won't do (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
When you sound the alarms and the chaos is rising
Leading the charge, yeah, I'm coming out fighting
Swear on the breath that I breathe
I'll never retreat, yeah, I'll be your army

[Drop: Neoni]
Ah-ah, a-a-army
I'll be your army
Ah-ah, a-a-army

When your nightmares turn to real life
And the grounds filled up with land mines
We will face it, standing side by side
You know I'll come running
When you need I'm coming
You know I'll come running (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Chorus: Neoni]
If you go to war then I'm going with you (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Pick up my sword, yeah, there's nothing I won't do (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
When you sound the alarms and the chaos is rising
Leading the charge, yeah, I'm coming out fighting
Swear on the breath that I breathe
I'll never retreat, yeah, I'll be your army

[Drop: Neoni]
Ah-ah, a-a-army
I'll be your army
Ah-ah, a-a-army

[Chorus: Neoni]
If you go to war then I'm going with you
Pick up my sword, yeah, there's nothing I won't do
When you sound the alarms and the chaos is rising
Leading the charge, yeah, I'm coming out fighting
Swear on the breath that I breathe
I'll never retreat, yeah, I'll be your army4Embed Army Army Besomorph;Arcando;Neoni house
