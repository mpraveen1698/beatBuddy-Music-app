6 Contributorsâ€‹you heard me Lyrics[Verse 1]
You said a lot last night
But I, I'm pretty sure you didn't speak at all
You say it's all alright
But I, I feel I'm talkin' to an empty wall

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we keep gettin' lost in the translation
I wonder if we're speakin' the same language
How did it get so overcomplicated?
Somehow

[Chorus]
Yeah, we could be away on the PCH right now
Wakin' up too late, wastin' days until sundown
But you can't even stay in the same room, yeah
'Cause you've been sleepin' on the couch
Rollin' over with the lights out
I just wanna talk, all this silence gettin' so loud
Said you never meant to hurt me
But I felt you lyin' every time you said you heard me

[Verse 2]
We said we'd try our best
I guess it didn't end up quite the way we'd hoped
We're hangin' by a thread
I never thought we'd watch it all go up in smoke

I wonder if we're speakin' the same language
How did it get so overcomplicated?

[Chorus]
Yeah, we could be away on the PCH right now
Wakin' up too late, wastin' days until sundown
But you can't even stay in the same room, yeah
'Cause you've been sleepin' on the couch
Rollin' over with the lights out
I just wanna talk, all this silence gettin' so loud
Said you never meant to hurt me
But I felt you lyin' every time you said you heard me

[Bridge]
Said you never meant
Said you never meant, meant, yeah
Said you never meant to hurt me
Lyin' when you said
Lyin' when you said, yeah, yeah
Lyin' when you said you heard me

[Chorus]
Yeah, we could be away on the PCH right now
Wakin' up too late, wastin' days until sundown
But you can't even stay in the same room, yeah
'Cause you've been sleepin' on the couch
Rollin' over with the lights out
I just wanna talk, all this silence gettin' so loud
Said you never meant to hurt me
But I felt you lyin' every time you said you heard me
[Outro]
Sleepin' on the couch, rollin' over with the lights out
I just wanna talk, all this silence gettin' so loud
Said you never meant to hurt me
But I felt you lyin' every time you said you heard meEmbed you heard me you heard me Heather Sommer edm
