5 ContributorsDANCE Lyrics[Intro]
(All I ever wanted was to dance
I wanna dance)

[Verse 1]
I've paid my bills on time, I've been working hard
Always done my best, I've always played my part
All these gloomy days, I just watched them pass

[Chorus]
When all I ever wanted was to dance, move my feet
Go out rocking to the beat
Take a chance, rocket man
Just like I'm in the band
I wanna dance, move my feet
Go out rocking to the beat
Take a chance, rocket man
All I ever wanted was to dance (Ayy)
I wanna dance (Ayy)
All I ever wanted was to dance (Ayy)
I wanna dance tonight
I wanna dance all night

[Verse 2]
Now I work all day, I even wear a suit
The walls are misty gray, and here's the awful truth
I'm wasting all my time, just working for the man
You might also like[Chorus]
When all I ever wanted was to dance, move my feet
Go out rocking to the beat
Take a chance, rocket man
Just like I'm in the band
I wanna dance, move my feet
Go out rocking to the beat
Take a chance, rocket man
All I ever wanted was to dance (Ayy)
I wanna dance (Ayy)
All I ever wanted was to dance (Ayy)
I wanna dance tonight
I wanna dance all night

[Bridge]
But it's not too late
I'm gonna turn this ship around when I get paid
I'm gonna leave this god damn job and finally
Just listen to myself, don't care 'bout nobody else but me
I'm gonna dance all night
I'm gonna dance all night
I'm gonna dance all night
Dance all night
I wanna dance

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted was to dance, move my feet
Go out rocking to the beat
Take a chance, rocket man
Just like I'm in the band
I wanna dance, move my feet
Go out rocking to the beat
Take a chance, rocket man
All I ever wanted was to dance (Ayy)
I wanna dance (Ayy)
All I ever wanted was to dance (Ayy)
I wanna dance tonight
I wanna dance all nightEmbed DANCE DANCE CLMD;Tungevaag house
