2 ContributorsKeeping Everything Inside Lyrics[Chorus]
I fell apart when I looked into your eyes
Cause I knew what you really felt inside
Didn't say a word, everyone assumed you're fine
But it hurts sometimes
Keeping everything, everything inside

[Verse 1]
Set the setting, hit the light switch
People party in the distance
You're not invited cause you're distant
Does a single soul even know that you exist?
Mind's running a marathon, you wanna try to join the fun but
Flip a penny it's thе wrong pick
Now you're drinking henny spending monеy on a bad bet

[Pre-Chorus]
You hide away from the crowd nobody ever sees you
And the ones that are loud don't even try to meet you
Kept a little smile so nobody would see through, but I do

[Chorus]
I fell apart when I looked into your eyes
Cause I knew what you really felt inside
Didn't say a word, everyone assumed you're fine
But it hurts sometimes
Keeping everything, everything inside
Keeping everything, everything inside
Keeping everything, everything inside
You might also like[Verse 2]
Feeling heavy when your head is in the clouds
Can't ignore it you can feel you're falling down
Wanting help but you know nobody's around
Everybody's at that party downtown
Wanna go but there's no one to drive you
But you don't need those people to like you

[Pre-Chorus]
Wishing you could be loud, I know the silence hurts you
You don't belong with that crowd, there's others waiting for you
Kept a little smile so nobody would see through, but I do

[Chorus]
I fell apart when I looked into your eyes
Cause I knew what you really felt inside
Didn't say a word, everyone assumed you're fine
But it hurts sometimes
Keeping everything, everything inside
Keeping everything, everything inside
Keeping everything, everything inside
Keeping everything, everything inside
Keeping everything, everything inside3Embed Keeping Everything Inside Keeping Everything Inside Sophie Pecora singer-songwriter
