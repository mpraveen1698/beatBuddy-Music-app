In the wealthiest sections, a killer complexion is often a great alibi
Valentino couture mixed with violence and gore
"Well, I guess I'm a pretty sick guy"
With my beauty routines and a fridge full of spleens
Some might say it's extreme, but it's time to say goodbye

[Chorus: Spencer Charnas]
So to hell with good intentions
So to hell is where I'll go
But the Devil makes exceptions
For All-American psychos
[Interlude: Woman & Spencer Charnas]
"Patrick, where are you going?'
"I'm just leaving"
"But why?"
"I have to rеturn some videotapes"

[Verse 2: Spencer Charnas]
You'll find no еscape once you're captured on tape
I'm aware it's a bit avant-garde
("Not the fucking face, you piece of bitch trash")
Casually cleaving without ever grieving
But wait, let me give you my card
"That's bone"
There is no real me, just this dark entity
That cannot be redeemed so it's time to say goodbye

So to hell with good intentions
So to hell is where I'll go
But the Devil makes exceptions
For All-American psychos
Hold my calls, I'll kill them all
So to hell with good intentions
For All-American psychos

[Skit: Spencer Charnas & Jacoby Shaddix]
"Do you like Ice Nine Kills?"
"Not really"
"Their early work was a little bit too 'scene' for me
But when The Silver Scream came out I think they really came into their own
Commercially and artistically
The whole album has a refined melodic sensibility that really makes it a cut above the rest"
"Hey Paul"
[Verse 3: Spencer Charnas]
"You've reached the law offices of Mitchell, Summerberg and Donald
Please leave a message"
Eric, hello, as my lawyer, you know
I'm psychotic, but I've crossed the line
I killed Drew, Chris and Mike, stabbed José with a knife
But I don't think I'm gonna get away with it this time
[Chorus: Spencer Charnas & Jacoby Shaddix]
To hell with good intentions
To hell is where I'll go
But the Devil makes exceptions
For All-American psychos
Hold my calls, I'll kill them all
So to hell with good intentions
For All-American, American psychos
