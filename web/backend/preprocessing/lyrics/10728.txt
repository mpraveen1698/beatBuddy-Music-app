Ooh, ooh-ooh
And I
Sometimes I
My life like

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Sitting in silence (Sitting in silence)
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Sitting in fire (Sitting in fire)
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Sitting in silence (Sitting in silence)
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Sitting in fire (Sitting in fire)

[Verse 1]
Your gold, your chain, your watch, yeah
Must feel like you're standing on top, yeah
Weed smoke in the bathroom stall
High school when away from it all (From it all)
That's when we never had to fear a fall (Fear a fall)
When we felt like it was us who ran the world (Ran the world)
Then we grew up, man, I wish wе never learnеd
Then we grew up, man, I wish we never learned

Maybe I'm out of my mind
Sitting in silence (Sitting in silence)
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Sitting in fire (Sitting in fire)
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Sitting in silence (Sitting in silence)
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Sitting in fire (Sitting in fire)

[Verse 2]
So take me back to all those things 'cause I have
Think I've lost my hope
Tell me where you wanna go
Nobody but me is gonna do it like that (Like that)
Nobody but you can't make me mad (Make me mad)
Talking to myself and it's taking me back (Taking me back)
Lost last time, go and take another lap

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Sitting in silence (Sitting in silence)
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Sitting in fire (Sitting in fire)
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Sitting in silence (Sitting in silence)
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Sitting in fire (Sitting in fire)
[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Tell me what you wanted
(And I) Wish I never started
(Sometimes I) Get a little weary
(My life like) A car without steering
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Tell me what you wanted
(And I) Wish I never started
(Sometimes I) Get a little weary
(My life like)3Embed Sitting In Fire Sitting In Fire MASN chill
