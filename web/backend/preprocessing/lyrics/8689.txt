One day, I will get drunk and text you
And I'll say, and I'll say
That I want you, let's get coffee
When you're down, when you're down
Yeah, you scare me, the nicest person
I will wait, I will wait
Dali said that you want me also
Will you say? Will you say?

[Chorus]
I thought no one would think about me
But it's not surprising that you thought about me
I thought you'd feel like an ocean, all reactive
And lucid in emotion, why'd you think about me?You might also like8Embed girl melanchole salvia palth emo
