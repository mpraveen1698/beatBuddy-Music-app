Fear hits like a drug in the veins
Hard to stop like a runaway train
Look around but there's nobody to blame
Oh, what a shame

[Refrain]
Spending nights just staring at the wall
Pay no mind to the demons in the hall
Yeah, I'm numb, I don't feel nothing at all
Braced for the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Am I going manic?
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head?

[Chorus]
Manic
Manic

[Verse 2]
It's a war but I'm never on attack
Holding on but I'm slippin' through the cracks
Don't wanna be another body in the stack
I'm never coming back

Spending nights just staring at the wall
Pay no mind to the demons in the hall
Yeah, I'm numb, I don't feel nothing at all
Braced for the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Am I going manic?
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head?

[Chorus]
Manic
Manic

[Post-Chorus]
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Am I going manic?
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Manic

[Bridge]
Out of body, out of mind
Tellin' everyone I'm fine
But I'm sellin' 'em a lie
Out of body, out of mind
Think I'm running out of time
Oh, God!
I don't wanna die
[Breakdown]
I don't wanna die
Die

[Outro]
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? (Ah)
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Manic
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Am I going manic?
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? ManicEmbed Manic Manic Wage War metalcore
