I think today is the best day of my life
Gonna rent a bicycle and ride
Around the city, around the city from nine 'til five
I think today is the best day of my life
Fuck thinking about the future all the time
If I'm alone, I'm alone and I don't mind

[Verse]
Movie stars in black and white pictures (Mm-mm)
Warm beer and valium mixtures (Mm-mm)
Am I in a dream? Crazy as it seems

[Chorus]
I think today is the best day of my life
Saw a billboard, it said something like
Everything, everything is gonna be alright
I think today is the best day of my life
My girlfriend looked worried and asked me why
But I don't know, I don't know, so I didn't reply

[Post-Chorus]
Laying on a car, you've got stars
I've got scars they don't see

[Chorus]
I think today is the best day of my life
Last night all I wanted to do was die
Right now, I'm happy to be aliveSee Tom Odell LiveGet tickets as low as $67You might also like1Embed Best Day Of My Life Best Day Of My Life Tom Odell chill
