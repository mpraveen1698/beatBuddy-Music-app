Ooh
I'm on my way

[Verse 1]
You found your way to my heart
Knew you were heading there right from the start
Sangria under the stars
Lost in an ocean of love

[Chorus]
Tell me that you're okay, even though you wrote me
Hate to see you lonely, I'm on my way
Tell me that you're okay, blame it on a Monday
Take me back to Sunday when I'm with you
Together we'll be okay
We will be okay
Tell me that you're okay, even though you wrote me
Hate to see you lonеly, I'm on my way

[Drop]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way

Wish we could only go back
My crappy guitar trying to play Fleetwood Mac
You and your toes in the sand
Wе had the world in our hands

[Chorus]
Tell me that you're okay, even though you wrote me
Hate to see you lonely, I'm on my way
Tell me that you're okay, blame it on a Monday
Take me back to Sunday when I'm with you
Together we'll be okay
We will be okay
Tell me that you're okay, even though you wrote me
Hate to see you lonely, I'm on my way
I'm on my way

[Drop]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way

[Outro]
Together we'll be okay
We will be okay
Together we'll be okay
We will be okay
I'm on my wayEmbed Okay Okay Nicky Romero;MARF;Wulf progressive-house
