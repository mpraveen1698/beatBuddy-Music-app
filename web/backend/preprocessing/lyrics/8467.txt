16 ContributorsOld Number Seven Lyrics[Verse 1]
I guess I grew up on an old dirt road
A-pedal to the metal, always did what I's told
'Til I found out that my brand new clothes
A-came second hand from the rich kids next door
And I grew up fast, I guess I grew up mean
There's a thousand things inside my head I wish I ain't seen
And now I just wander through a real bad dream
A-feelin' like I'm comin' apart at the seams

[Chorus]
Well, thank you Jack Daniel's Old Number Seven
Tennessee whiskey got me drinkin' in heaven
An'a, angels start to look good to me
They're gonna have to deport me to the fiery deep
Oh, thank you Jack Daniel's Old Number Seven
Tennessee whiskey got me drinkin' in heaven
An'a I know I can't stay here too long
'Cause I can't go a week without doin' wrong
(Old Number Seven)
Without doin' wrong (I'm drinkin' in heaven)
Without doin' wrong (Old Number Seven)
Without doin' wrong (I'm drinkin' in heaven)

[Verse 2]
So I'm sittin' as the barstool, it starts to grow roots
I'm feelin' like an old worn-out pair of shoes
Oh, tell me what is it that I should do
When I'm a-swimmin' in the liquor, only halfway through?
So I'm watchin' as his wings spread as wide as could be
A-come on now and wrap them around me
'Cause all I want to do now is fall to sleep
A-come down here and lay next to me
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, thank you Jack Daniel's Old Number Seven
Tennessee whiskey got me drinkin' in heaven
An'a up here the bottle never runs dry
And you never wake up with those tears in your eyes
Oh, thank you Jack Daniel's Old Number Seven
Tennessee whiskey got me drinkin' in heaven
An'a angels start to look good to me
They're gonna have to deport me to the fiery deeps

[Outro]
(Old Number Seven)
To the fiery deeps (I'm drinkin' in heaven)
To the fiery deeps (Old Number Seven)
To the fiery deeps (I'm drinkin' in heaven)4Embed Old Number Seven The Devil Makes Three The Devil Makes Three bluegrass
