[Verse 1]
Hide me now
Under Your wings
Cover me
Within Your mighty hand

I will soar with You above the storm
Father, You are King over the flood
I will be still, know You are God

Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
Know His power
In quietness and trust

[Chorus]
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
Father, You are King over the flood
I will be still, know You are God
