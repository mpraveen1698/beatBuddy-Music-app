We used to be the life of the party
Body to body, dance the night away
Shoot tequila straight
Obsessed with each other
And down for another round until last call
Wasn't alcohol

[Pre-Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini]
Keeping us up 'til the sun came around
Thought we'd stay drunk forever but now

[Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini]
You're the reason there's no whiskey anywhere inside this house
You're the reason all my friends know I don't go downtown
You're the reason I hate champagne, never used to turn it down
You're thе only thing I want when one drop hits my mouth
Baby, you're thе reason I quit drinking

[Verse 2: Paul Klein, with Kelsea Ballerini]
We used to be dizzy all morning
Hungover, pouring cups of coffee black
Kiss and crawl right back
Under the covers and down for another
Hour in that bed, now I'm here instead
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Paul Klein]
Waking up sober, it feels kinda nice
Except that I can't sleep at night

[Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Paul Klein]
You're the reason there's no whiskey anywhere inside this house
You're the reason all my friends know I don't go downtown
You're the reason I hate champagne, never used to turn it down
You're the only thing I want when one drop hits my mouth
Baby, you're the reason I quit drinking

[Bridge: Paul Klein, Kelsea Ballerini, Both]
I quit thinking (I quit thinking), staring at the ceiling (Oh, oh)
And all my cabernet is down the kitchen sink and (It's down the kitchen sink, yeah)
I quit mixing (I quit mixing), all my drinks and feelings
It's not fixing that you're gone

[Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini, Paul Klein, Both]
You're the reason there's no whiskey anywhere inside this house
You're the reason all my friends know I don't go downtown
You're the reason I hate champagne, never used to turn it down
You're the only thing I want when one drop hits my mouth (The only thing I want, baby)
Baby, you're the reason (Oh, oh)
You're the reason, I quit drinking1Embed I Quit Drinking I Quit Drinking Kelsea Ballerini;LANY country
