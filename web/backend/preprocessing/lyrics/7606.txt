42 ContributorsJudas Lyrics[Intro]
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming

[Verse 1]
You are beautiful on the inside
You are innocence personified
And I will drag you down and sell you out
Run away
I am cold like December snow
I have carved out this soul made of stone
And I will drag you down and sell you out

[Pre-Chorus]
Embraced by the darkness, I'm losing the light
Encircled by demons, I fight

[Chorus]
What have I become? Now that I've betrayed
Everyone I've ever loved, I pushed them all away
And I have been a slave to the Judas in my mind
Is there something left of me to save
In the wreckage of my life? My life
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
Judas in, Judas in my mind
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
Judas in, Judas in my mind
Judas in my mind

Oh, this guilt is a heavy cross
There is blood on the path I walk
And each step I take is haunting me

[Pre-Chorus]
Embraced by the darkness, I'm losing the light
Encircled by demons, I fight

[Chorus]
What have I become? Now that I've betrayed
Everyone I've ever loved, I pushed them all away
And I have been a slave to the Judas in my mind
Is there something left of me to save
In the wreckage of my life? My life
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
Judas in, Judas in my mind
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
Judas in, Judas in my mind

[Bridge]
Judas in my mind
Judas in my mind
[Chorus]
What have I become? Now that I've betrayed
Everyone I've ever loved, I pushed them all away
And I have been a slave to the Judas in my mind
Is there something left of me to save
In the wreckage of my life? My life
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
Judas in, Judas in my mind
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
I'm become, I'm become, I'm becoming
Judas in, Judas in my mind
Judas in my mind9Embed Judas Judas Fozzy metal
