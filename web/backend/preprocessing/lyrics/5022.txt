5 ContributorsHarder State of Mind LyricsI turn the night to day
I'm feeling so alive
Cause I'm in a harder state of mind
When the music plays
I leave the world behind
Cause I'm in a harder state
A harder state of mind

Oh my God, it's the funky shit

I turn the night to day
I'm feeling so alive
Cause I'm in a harder state of mind
When the music plays
I leave the world behind
Cause I'm in a harder state
A harder state of mind
A harder state of mind

Cause I'm in a harder state
A harder state of mind

A harder state of mind

I turn the night to day
I'm feeling so alive
Cause I'm in a harder state of mind
When the music plays
I leave the world behind
Cause I'm in a harder state
A harder state of mind
A harder state of mind
