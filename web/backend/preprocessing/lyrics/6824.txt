If you wait for me, then I'll come back to you
On my own
On my own (Yeah, ayy)
And I say

[Verse 1: Powfu]
Back in 2012, school bells would send us out at lunch
Talk under the tree about our favorite shows and stupid ones
Parents sat me down one night, told me that we couldn't stay
Went to bed thinkin' about you, woke up on a plane, ayy
Wish I never left, 'cause you took away my breath
You can say that we were young, but me and you were meant
For eternity, no surgery could take you off my heart
Just hang onto my words and we'll make it through this part, yeah, ayy

[Chorus: Sarcastic Sounds & Powfu]
If you wait for me, then I'll come back to you
On my own
On my own
And I say (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Powfu]
I've been waitin' for this day to come, it's finally gettin' closer
On our way to graduate and then I'll be heading over
You my treasure, I'm your soldier, stay up 'til the night is over
We talkin' on the phone, but want your head between my shoulders
Savin' up for a ticket on the side
Been a minute of our time
When I see you, I might cry
No lie, that's on my gravestone
Promise me you'll stay close
Days without you, yeah, I hate those
Ayy

Then I'll come back to you

On my own
And I say
[Verse 3: Rxseboy]
Plane ride to your city, took an Uber to your house, yeah (To your house)
Had to keep it secret from you, did it unannounced
Doorbell, parents saw me, sat me down on the couch
Talked to them about my life, they told me they were truly proud
Two knocks, door open, you were standing there with him
So shocked, I don't get it, can we run it back again?
Room spinning, palms sweaty, but I'm sober
"I've been in love with you forever" is what I wish I would have told her
