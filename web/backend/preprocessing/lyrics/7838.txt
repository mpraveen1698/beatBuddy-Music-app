R.I.P. my enemies, I'll send 'em back to hell
Fucking with me, bitch I'll turn that shit to armageddon
R.I.P. my enemies, I'll send 'em back to hell
Fucking with me, bitch I'll turn that shit to armageddon
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
I'm in the AMG, no bitch you better not play with me
This ain't no 50, coming up is he, copped the 63
Wrapped in satin black just like my soul, no holy ghost in me
Pull up half alive, I feel like dying, what's it gonna be?
I'm rolling with a box of blades, I'm coming for your throat
Slash 'n' dash and then I float
Now you know I want that smoke
On this road I walk alone
Can nobody tell me shit, fuck boy
Got a problem, we can end this quick
If I die I'm gonna hunt up, pull 'еm underground with me
Six feet deep, I'ma put you therе quickly

[Verse 1]
They say they miss the old me, here I go I'm back again
I never left I just been planning this destruction to begin
Bitch I'm killing shit, don't survive then why so violent, I don't know
Asking stupid fucking questions, you know that's just how it goes

R.I.P. my enemies, I'll send 'em back to hell
Fucking with me, bitch I'll turn that shit to armageddon
What?!
R.I.P. my enemies, I'll send 'em back to hell
Fucking with me, bitch I'll turn that shit to armageddon
You know, you know, you know

[Verse 2]
You know lately things been moving kinda slow, I need excitement
I'm feening for some violence
I see you bitch, now pull up if you want
Pussy boy, you talk like I don't run this shit
Pull out the gun, now pulling a blade like it's dovakhiin in this bitch
You want some problems, well that's good 'cause I ain't got shit left to live for
I'm severing your liver, my presence make you shiver (Bitch)
I'll drown 'em in a river, watch 'em wither, lovely story
That's the consequences stepping on my deadly territory
Don't you worry, it'll be swift, my blade like lightning, open a rift
Throw you in it, better repent
Making you bleed, my favorite sin

[Hook]
I-I'm in the AMG, no bitch you better not play with me
This ain't no 50, coming up dizzy, cop the 63
Wrapped in satin black just like my soul, no holy ghost in me
P-pull up half alive, I feel like dying, what's it gonna be?
I'm rolling with a box of blades, coming for your throat
Slash 'n' dash and then I fall
Now you know I want that smoke
On this road I walk alone
Can nobody tell me shit, fuck boy
Got a problem, make it end this quick
If I die I'm gonna hunt up, pull 'em underground with me
Six feet deep, I'ma put you there quicklyEmbed Satin Black Follow Me Into Hell iamjakehill sad
