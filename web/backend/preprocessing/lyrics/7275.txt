49 Contributorsâ€‹cold weather Lyrics[Intro]
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

[Verse 1]
I love the way you make me feel when I'm staring at my screen
At four AM, trying not to fall asleep
And you hit me up just to see if I'm OK
I loved it way too goddamn much when you told me you don't mind
When I keep you up sending Mamegoma Lines
You know it's shit like that that makes me wanna be alive

[Chorus]
I wanna say I think it's OK if we just don't both feel the same way
But I feel like we're more than just friends
'Cause it took six sad months to realize
I didn't miss the cold weather, I just missed you, and
I didn't miss the sweater weather, I just missed you

[Post-Chorus]
(You, you)
(You, you)
(You, you)
(You, you)

I used to think I'd get by fine, tryna hide what's on my mind
Friendships felt feigned, and strangers' shapes seemed so unkind
I was alone in crowds but not alone in sentiment
I've been so isolated by the time I trade to stay alive
Brought up with the choice of success or suicide
So I'll call in sick again just to spend the day with you

[Chorus 2]
Wanna say I think it's so gay that we really both feel the same way
That I feel like we're more than just friends
It took too long to realize
I didn't miss the cold weather, I just missed you
I didn't miss the sweater weather, I just missed you
I didn't miss Orange County, I just missed you
I didn't miss 69 Tarocco, I just missed you
I didn't miss Culver City, I just missed you
Or getting drunk outside the Smell, no, I just missed you
'Cause I don't need the cold weather like I need you
And I don't need the sweater weather I just need you

[Outro]
