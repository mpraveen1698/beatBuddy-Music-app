Who took the bomp?

[Verse 1]
Every day and night
Every day and night
I can see yr disco, disco dick
Is sucking my heart out of my mind
I'm outta time, I'm outta fuckin' time
I'm a gasoline gut with a Vaseline mind, but
Wanna disco? Wanna see me disco?
Let me hear you depoliticize my rhyme
(One, two, three, four)
You got what you been asking for
Yr so policy free and yr fantasy wheels
And everything you think and everything you feel
Is alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

[Verse 2]
I take you home, now watch me get you hot
Yr just a parrot when yr screaming, and yr shouting
"More crackers, please! More crackers, please!"
You want what you want, but you don't wanna be on yr knees
Who does your, who does your hair?

[Chorus]
Who took the bomp from the bomp-a-lomp-a-lomp?
Who took the ram from the rama-lama-ding-dong?
Who took the bomp from the bomp-a-lomp-a-lomp?
Who took the ram from the rama-lama-ding-dong?

"How are you?"
"Fine, thank you"
"How are you?"
"Fine, thank you"

[Verse 3]
You bought a new van the first year of yr band
Yr cool, and I hardly wanna say "not"
Because I'm so bored
That I'd be entertained, even by a stupid fuckin'
Linoleum floor, linoleum floor
Yr lyrics are dumb like a linoleum floor
I'll walk on it, I'll walk all over you
Walk on it, walk on it, walkin', one, two

[Chorus]
(Who? Who? Who? Who?)
Who took the bomp from the bomp-a-lomp-a-lomp?
Who took the ram from the rama-lama-ding-dong?
Who took the bomp from the bomp-a-lomp-a-lomp?
Who took the ram from the rama-lama-ding-dong?

[Outro: Unknown]
"See you later"
"See you later"
"See you later"
"See you later"10Embed Deceptacon Le Tigre Le Tigre punk
