4 ContributorsLove You More Lyrics[Verse 1]
Late nights, long drives, down back roads
Nothing else could come close
To, cheap wine, pool lights, no one home
Sneaking out to be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we both have our separate lives
'Cause we move on and we get by
And oh, oh-oh
I met him and I thought that I'd
Forget the world I left behind
But no-oh

[Chorus]
If I'm being honest
I don't know if I'll feel love
As I did when I was young anymore
He's all that I wanted
But you're the one that I adore
There's two things I know for sure, I love him
But I'll always love you more

[Verse 2]
New state, new place, someone new
Wish you well, I really do
And maybe our time lines just didn't align
And that's alright
Or we messed up, too many times
To save us, but sometimes

When he puts his hand in mine
I still feel ours intertwined
And oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
If I'm being honest (If I'm being honest)
I don't know if I'll feel love
As I did when I was young anymore (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
He's all that I wanted (Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm)
But you're the one that I adore (That I adore)
There's two things I know for sure, I love him
But I'll always love you more

[Bridge]
I can't give him everything, not all of me when
You still have partially, some part of me (Part of me)
I can't give him everything, not all of me when
You still got me

[Chorus]
If I'm being honest
I don't know if I'll feel love
As I did when I was young anymore
He's all that I wanted
But you're the one that I adore
There's two things I know for sure, I love him
But I'll always love you moreEmbed Love You More Love You More Ashley Kutcher singer-songwriter
