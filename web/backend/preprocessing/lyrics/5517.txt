Don't matter what you look like
Don't matter what you wear
How many rings you got on your finger
We don't care, no

[MAMA ODIE & COMPANY]
We don't care!

[MAMA ODIE]
Don't matter where you come from
Don't even matter what you are
A dog, a pig, a cow, a goat
Got 'em all in here

[COMPANY]
We got 'em all in here!

[MAMA ODIE]
And they all knew what they wanted
What they wanted me to do
I told 'em what they needed
Just like I be tellin' you

[MAMA ODIE & COMPANY]
You gotta dig a little deeper
You might also like[MAMA ODIE]
Find out who you are

[MAMA ODIE & COMPANY]
You gotta dig a little deeper

[MAMA ODIE]
It really ain't that far
When you find out who you are
You find out what you need

[MAMA ODIE & COMPANY]
Blue skies and sunshine

[MAMA ODIE]
Guaranteed

[MAMA ODIE (COMPANY)]
You gotta dig (Dig!)
You gotta dig (Dig!)

[MAMA ODIE]
Prince Froggy is a rich little boy
You wanna be rich again?
That ain't gonna make you happy now
Did it make you happy then? No!
[MAMA ODIE & COMPANY]
Money ain't got no soul
Money ain't got no heart

[MAMA ODIE]
All you need is some self-control
Make yourself a brand new start

[MAMA ODIE & COMPANY]
You gotta dig a little deeper

[MAMA ODIE]
Don't have far to go

[MAMA ODIE & COMPANY]
You gotta dig a little deeper

[MAMA ODIE, with COMPANY]
Tell the people Mama told you so
Can't tell you what you'll find
Maybe love will grant you peace of mind
Dig a little deeper and you'll know

[MAMA ODIE]
Miss Froggy, might I have a word?
You's a hard one, that's what I heard
Your daddy was a loving man
Family through and through
You your daddy's daughter
What he had in him, you got in you
[MAMA ODIE & COMPANY]
You gotta dig a little deeper

[MAMA ODIE]
For you, it's gonna be tough

[MAMA ODIE & COMPANY]
You gotta dig a little deeper

[MAMA ODIE]
You ain't dug near far enough
Dig down deep inside yourself
You'll find out what you need

[MAMA ODIE & COMPANY]
Blue skies and sunshine

[MAMA ODIE]
Guaranteed

(spoken)
Open up the windows, let in the light, children!

Blue skies and sunshine
Blue skies and sunshine
