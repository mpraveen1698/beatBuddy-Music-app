One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Yeah, she's in love with the concept
As if we're all just how she imagined
'Cause we're in love, I just don't know it yet, huh
Well, tell me how am I supposed to see the magic?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I don't believe in it no more
But I won't tell her
'Cause I always imagined
It's easier if she thinks she won
So I'ma let her, and she said

[Chorus 1]
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
Girl, I don't think you know me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
No I don't love you, and I never did
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks
But just know
I'm not singing for your XO
I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah

Yeah

[Verse 2]
Came and went like the summertime
Was that a sunset or sunrise?
Looking back like, "Where'd the time go?"
So much for trying to keep this moving slow

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I don't believe in her no more
But I remember
How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted
I still remember what she said

[Chorus 2]
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
But I don't think she knew me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
But I'm no liar, and I never hid anything
You should've seen it coming to this
Just know
I'm not singing for an ex, though
I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
[Outro]
Uh, girl I'm just singing
I'm just singing, yeah
I'm just singing 'cause it's over87Embed XO i think you think too much of me EDEN indie-pop
