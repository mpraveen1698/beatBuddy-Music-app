You know, without you, I'm so lonely
When you're not here, 911 calling
Into your heat again, I'm diving
Darling, you, darling, you, baby

[Verse 1: Wonwoo, Mingyu]
(Mm) Fighting 'round in circles, where is the way out?
(Mm) 'Cause I know that our love was hotter than the Sun
Yeah, the taste of this tequila I'm drinking now
Isn't bitter than my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Dino, DK, WOOZI]
(If you know this)
I want to know our problem, blood type, or DNA
(If you know this)
Friends see my feed and worry, do you, babe? Yeah
Been waiting for your call every night
But I can't wait no more
Dialing you-u-u, sorry, darling, you

[Chorus: Joshua, Hoshi]
You know, without you, I'm so lonely
When you're not here, 911 calling
Into your heat again, I'm diving
Darling, you, darling, you, baby
You know, without you, I'm so lonely
If you won't be here, 911 calling
Falling to you, I'm always diving
Darling, you, darling, you, baby
