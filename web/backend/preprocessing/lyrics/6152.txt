6 ContributorsPeople Change Lyrics[Verse 1]
Maybe in ten years
You'll call me on your telephone
Wondering if I'm all alone
Remember how we knew each other?
In ten years, everyone's been down the line
And we've all ended up fine
I no longer know your number

[Hook]
I used to love you like the world would end
I used to love you like a child
The thing about people is they change
When they walk away

[Verse 2]
We used to talk real slow
About the things that no one knows
I hate when people bring flowers
Trapped in glass their final hour
And life rolls, it's all so fast until it slows
We cried that night in Carrboro
Realized we were letting go

[Hook]
I used to love you like the world would end
I used to love you like a child
The thing about people is they change
When they walk away
You might also likeUsed to love you like the world would end
Used to love you like a child
The thing about people is they change
When they walk awayEmbed People Change Edges Run Mipso bluegrass
