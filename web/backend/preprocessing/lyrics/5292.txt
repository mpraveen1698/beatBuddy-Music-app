16 ContributorsThrough The Echoes Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm always wondering what it would be like to die
She asks me, "Why?"
I always smile when I feel like I'm gonna cry
And she asked me, "Why?"
Over the cliff, and phantom sands
She's always offering me her hand
And I hear her coming

[Chorus]
Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Straight to me
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over again

[Verse 2]
She's always wondering what it would feel like to fly
I ask her, "Why?"
She says evеrything that she sees shine is in the sky
Up thеre shining
When your belly's rumbling down the phone
When you ask for bread and get a stone
When you feel like you're alone
Listen for me, coming

Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Straight to you
Listen for me coming through the echoes
Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Straight to you
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over again

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over again
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over again

[Chorus]
Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Straight to you
Listen for me through the echoes
Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Straight to youEmbed Through The Echoes Through The Echoes / Lose It Paolo Nutini british
