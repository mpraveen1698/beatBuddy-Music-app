27 ContributorsBang Bang Lyrics[Intro: K'naan]
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang

[Verse 1: K'naan]
Ah, there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
In other words, she came through explodin' in the podium
Dynamite Napoleon like sodium mixed with petroleum
Slowly but surely, she was walking toward me
Cut the convo short 'cause she had to wake up early
But continuing the story, don't worry
She gave me digits for her Blackberry
"You're very handsome" is what she said
And the way she looked in my eyes said, "put me to bed"
Oh my, oh my, I should have known when she said to me on the phone
"You do not know me very well, but I would never hurt a fly"
Then she aimed for my chest with love in her eye
Said she aimed for my chest with love in her eye

[Chorus: Adam Levine & K'naan]
She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one
It went bang, bang, bang, straight through my heart
(Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away
I stood my ground and let her spray, ooh
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang

Scorpion, she's so hot sheâ€™s a scorch-ian
Killing me softly: Lauryn or Kevorkian
Couldn't tell if she's cuckoo or quirky, when
I asked her her name and she said, "Call me Ten"
Testing, testing
Things just got more interesting
She's dressed in a vest pin, double-breasted holster
A very Western toaster
She ain't nothing Kosher
Ah, she lets me closer
Hotter than a pepper-crusted Samosa
While I try to keep my composure

[Chorus: Adam Levine & K'naan]
She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one
It went bang, bang, bang, straight through my heart
(Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away
I stood my ground and let her spray, ooh
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang
[Bridge: K'naan]
Am I wrong?
But what is love without the pain to go along?
And what is pain
If not the reason for me to sing this song?
And this song is for the weak and for the strong
'Cause I was strong
And still she got me, she got me
Bang, bang, she got me
She got me, she got me
Bang, bang
[Chorus: Adam Levine & K'naan]
She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one
It went bang, bang, bang, straight through my heart
(Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away
I stood my ground and let her spray, ooh
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
