13 Contributorsâ€‹buzzkill Lyrics[Intro]
I'm a buzzkill, I'm the broken one
I'm a victim of the things you've done
I'm a phantom of who I thought I was
Ever since you, ever since you

[Verse 1]
I don't talk about it
Unless I make a joke about it
That's just what you want, huh?
That's just what you want
Walking on the ceiling
Gettin' used to never feeling
You're still having fun, huh?
And I don't trust no one

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't keep your secrets now
You can't keep my volume down

[Chorus]
I'm a buzzkill
Gonna kill your high 'cause I'm pissed off
I think you know why, and you're scared now
'Cause receipts don't lie
Ever since you, ever since you
Fucked up, haven't made a sound
Got me upset now I'm gettin' loud
Better watch me burn this whole place down
Ever since you, ever since you

Know what you did
Don't let it happen again, I pray for the kid
That calls you a friend
You pull them right in, told them their sins
Holy motherfucker, do you have something to say?
'Cause this is the beginning of the price you're gonna pay

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't keep your secrets now
You can't keep my volume down

[Chorus]
I'm a buzzkill
Gonna kill your high 'cause I'm pissed off
I think you know why, and you're scared now
'Cause receipts don't lie
Ever since you, ever since you
Fucked up, haven't made a sound
Got me upset now I'm gettin' loud
Better watch me burn this whole place down
Ever since you, ever since you
Ever since you, ever since you2Embed buzzkill forever fifteen MOTHICA soul
