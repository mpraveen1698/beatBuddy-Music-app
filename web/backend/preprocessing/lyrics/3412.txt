When I'm walking down the street
All I hear are love songs
Why does this feel unfamiliar to me?
My Korean ain’t that good
Even translators are no use
Just wondering about how you feel
Just wondering about how you feel, no (Oh)
What words should I use? I don't know
What should I say? I don't know
Why am I like this? I don't know
You're on my mind
What words should I use? I don't know
What should I say? I don't know
Why am I like this? I don't know
You're on my mind
Baby, my minds really drawing a blank (A blank)
But, I'm confident in body language
Let me show you girl, give me some of your time, yeah
Palms get sweaty when I look at you, yeah
Smile for me to ease the mood
Let me take you on a magic carpet ride, uh, yeah

[Chorus: Jay Park]
Take my hand and follow me
Clear day and a full moon
Teach me tonight
GA-NA-DA-RA-MA-BA-SA
Take my hand and follow me
Clear day and a full moon
Teach me tonight
GA-NA-DA-RA-MA-BA-SA

Even if it isn't perfect
Don't worry, I think I know how you feel
Should I come take a closer look?
I wonder every night
When I'm walking down the street
I keep thinking about you
I can't even recognize myself
Even your lost fingers
On top of the translator
Keep lingering in my head
I'm okay with body language too
But if you blank out, just smile
I'll teach you everything tonight
I may look like a bad boy

[Pre-Chorus: Jay Park]
But my heart melts when I see you
But my heart melts when I see you
I wouldn't mind if I died in your arms

[Chorus: IU & Jay Park, Jay Park]
Take my hand and follow me
Clear day and a full moon
Teach me tonight
GA-NA-DA-RA-MA-BA-SA
Take my hand and follow me
Clear day and a full moon
Teach me tonight
GA-NA-DA-RA-MA-BA-SA
Take my hand and follow me
Clear day and a full moon
Teach me tonight
GA-NA-DA-RA-MA-BA-SA
Take my hand and follow me
Clear day and a full moon
Teach me tonight
