7 ContributorsGive Me Your Forever Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you remember?
When we were young you were always with your friends
Wanted to grab your hand and run away from them
I knew that it was time to tell you how I feel
So I made a move, I took your hand
My heart was beating loud like I've never felt before
You were smiling at me like you wanted more
I think you're the one I've never seen before

[Chorus]
I want you to know, I love you the most
I'll always bе there right by your side
'Causе baby, you're always in my mind
Just give me your forever (Give me your forever)
I want you to know that you'll be the one
And I'll be the guy who'll be on his knees
To say I love you and I need you
And say I'd die for you (Just give me your forever)

[Verse 2]
I never knew it would be possible
For you to be with me
'Cause you loved someone else back in '73
I was so jealous seeing you with him
Oh, baby, I know that I can treat you better back in those nights
Oh, you wouldn't cry from his stupid lies
Oh, baby, I was there watching wishing you to be mine
You might also like[Chorus]
I want you to know, I love you the most
I'll always be there right by your side
'Cause baby, you're always in my mind
Just give me your forever (Give me your forever)
I want you to know that you'll be the one
And I'll be the guy who'll be on his knees
To say I love you and I need you
And say I'd die for you (Just give me your forever)

[Bridge]
Do you remember?
I was on the aisle
Waiting for you, babe
Saw you in your gown
I was crying all my tears
I told myself that you are the one (You are the one)

[Chorus]
I want you to know, I love you the most
I'll always be there right by your side
'Cause baby, you're always in my mind (You are always in my mind)
Just give me your forever (Give me your forever)
I want you to know that you'll be the one
And I'll be the guy who'll be on his knees
To say I love you and I need you (Just give me your forever)
And say I'd die for you (Just give me your forever)
