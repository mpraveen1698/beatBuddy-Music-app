4 Contributors青花瓷 (White & Blue Porcelain) LyricsThe brush outlines a beautiful pattern, brush strokes becoming lighter
The peony on the bottle, simplest beauty, just like you
Whiffs of incense smoke bring your troubles to my heart
I pause halfway while painting
The glazing of the lady’s portrait hides her charm
Your smile, to me, like a budding flower
But your beauty dissipates like smoke
To a place I can never reach

The perfect shade of blue awaits the right weather, like how I wait for you
From a thousand miles away, I gaze at the curling chimney smoke
The calligraphy beneath the bottle, elegance of the Han Dynasty
Our meeting I foreshadowed

The perfect shade of blue awaits the right weather, like how I wait for you
The moonlight smudged away the remnants of our ending
Like legendary porcelain obsessed with itself
Your eyes full of laughter

Those blue carp seem to come alive on the white bowl
While I am imitating the Song inscription I’m thinking of you
The eon of secrets you buried in the kiln
It’s exquisiteness like an embroidery needle

The banana tree outside brought the sudden downpour
And in turn the copper rust on the door handle
My passing by Jiangnan brings me to you
Yet you fade away into the deep abyss of the Chinese painting
