16 ContributorsChange Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't feel the sun's coming out, today
It's staying in, it's gonna find another way, yeah
As I sit here in this misery
I don't think I'll ever, no, Lord
See the sun from here

[Chorus]
And oh, as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say
And then they'll say
"Hey, look at him
I'll never live that way"
And that's okay
They're just afraid to change

[Verse 2]
And when you feel your life ain't worth living
You've got to stand up, and take a look around you
And you look up, way to the sky, yeah
And when your deepest thoughts are broken
Keep on dreamin', boy
'Cause when you stop dreamin', it's time to die

[Verse 3]
And as we all play parts of tomorrow, oh, Lord knows
Some ways, we'll work
And other ways, we'll play
But I know we can't all stay here forever
So, I wanna write my words on the face of today
And then, they'll paint it

[Chorus]
And oh, as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say
They'll say:
"Hey, look at him
And where he is these days"
When life is hard, you have to change
When life is hard, you have to change2Embed Change Blind Melon Blind Melon grunge
