Don't try to make yourself remember, darling
Don’t look for me; I'm just a story you've been told
So let’s pretend a little longer
'Cause when we're gone, everything goes on

[Verse 1]
Well, you were staring at the window
And I said, "I wanna take you to the sea
And when I'm better, we'll do everything"
I gotta stop makin' promises I can't keep

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I was gone tomorrow, won't the waves crash on?
Is it selfish that I’m happy as we pass the setting sun?
Someday I’ll bе overcast, but you won't have to cry
’Cause wе'll do the grieving, while I'm by your side, I said:

[Chorus]
Don't try to make yourself remember, darling
Don’t look for me; I'm just a story you've been told
So let's pretend a little longer
'Cause when we're gone, everything goes on

[Verse 2]
And I'm so scared of getting used to this
All the vines that keep you tethered in your room
Well, someday both of us are leaving here
But for now, I'll just bring the sea to you, oh-oh-oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Will you meet me in the daylight like we did before?
Then, I felt you on my shoulder, and you weren't suffering anymore
You said, "I'm sorry that you worried," but don't apologize
I told you to forget me, but you stayed by my side when I said:

[Chorus]
Don't try to make yourself remember, darling
Don't look for me; I'm just a story you've been told
So let's pretend a little longer
And when we're gone, oh, oh-oh
