3 ContributorsThe Open Road Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here I am in this old town
Still dreamin' of the open road
I've been here for far too long
There's so much more than this, I know
It's been years since I've been gone
I miss the way it feels to roam
This urge that's grown inside my heart
To pack my bags and hit the road

[Chorus]
I'm dreamin' of the road again
Set free in the wind
Feels like we've found home again
On the road that's grown within

[Verse 2]
We will fill the tank and make our way
Down windy tracks and beaten roads
We'll drive away from this old town
And find a place we've never known
With the summer sun over open plains
With the windows down, we'll drive along
And our hearts will grow as our troubles fade away

[Chorus]
I'm dreamin' of the road again
Set free in the wind
Feels like we've found home again
On the road that's grown within
