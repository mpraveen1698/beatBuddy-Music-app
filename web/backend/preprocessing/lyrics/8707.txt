I thought of angels choking on their halos
Get them drunk on rose water (Water)
See how dirty I can get them pulling out their fragile teeth
And clip their tiny wings (Clip their tiny wings)

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick with Foxes]
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name, it will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name

[Chorus: Patrick with Foxes, Foxes]
If heaven's grief brings hell's rain
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For just one yesterday

[Verse 2: Patrick with Foxes]
Letting people down is my thing, baby, find yourself a new gig
This town ain't big enough for two of us
I don't have the right name or the right looks (Right looks)
But I have twice the heart
[Pre-Chorus: Patrick with Foxes, Foxes]
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name, it will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name (Name)

[Chorus: Patrick with Foxes, Foxes]
If heaven's grief brings hell's rain
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For just one yesterday

[Bridge: Foxes & Patrick]
If I spilled my guts
The world would never look at you the same way
And now I'm here to give you all of my love (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
So I can watch your face as I take it all away (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus: Patrick with Foxes, Foxes]
If heaven's grief brings hell's rain
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For just one yesterday
