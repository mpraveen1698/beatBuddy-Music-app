I heat up
I can't cool down
You got me spinnin'
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round
And 'round it goes
Where it stops
Nobody knows

[Verse 2]
Every time you call my name
I heat up
Like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame
Full of desire
Kiss me, baby
Let the fire get higher

[Chorus]
Abra-abra-cadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra

[Verse 3]
You make me hot
You make me sigh
You make me laugh
You make me cry
Keep me burnin'
For your love
With the touch
Of a velvet glove

Abra-abra-cadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra

[Verse 4]
I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin
Leather and lace
Black panties with an angel's face

[Verse 5]
I can see magic
In your eyes
I hear the magic
In your sighs
Just when I think I'm gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say

[Chorus]
Abra-abra-cadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra
[Verse 2]
Every time
You call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame
Full of desire
Kiss me baby
Let the fire get higher
Yeah, yeah

My situation goes 'round and 'round
I heat up
I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
