It was summer when I saw your face
Looked like a teenage runaway
Oh God, I never thought we'd take it that far
Some killer queen you are

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm running and I can't stop anywhere I go
I think about it every day and night, I can't let go
Man, I'm never the same
We were shotgun lovers, I'm a shotgun running away

[Chorus]
So come a little closer
There was something I can tell, yeah
You are such a rollercoaster
And a killer queen you are

[Post-Chorus]
Rollercoaster, I don't say no
Rollercoaster, when you don't say no
And it's such a rollercoaster
Some killer queen you are

[Verse 2]
We took the bones out from the road
Those endless nights that we traveled we stole
You let your clothes fall to the floor
And lit a fire while I waited for more

Now I'm running and I won't stop, I don't wanna go
I think about it every day and night, I can't let go
And hey, I'm never the same
It's a hundred miles an hour on a dirt road running away

[Chorus]
So come a little closer
There was something I can tell, yeah
You are such a rollercoaster
And a killer queen you are

[Post-Chorus]
Rollercoaster, I don't say no
Rollercoaster, when you don't say no
And it's such a rollercoaster
Some killer queen you are

[Bridge]
Come a little closer
I'm sure, come a little closer

[Chorus]
Why don't you come a little closer
There was something I can tell, yeah
You are such a rollercoaster
Some killer queen you are
[Post-Chorus]
Rollercoaster, I don't say no
Rollercoaster, when you don't say no
And it's such a rollercoaster
Some killer queen you are

[Outro]
So come a little closer
There was something I can tell, yeah
You are such a rollercoaster
And a killer queen you are
Rollercoaster, I don't say no
Rollercoaster, when you don't say no
And it's such a rollercoaster
Some killer queen you are26Embed Rollercoaster Strange Desire Bleachers indie-pop
