Face away
Deal with the pain
Your own way
How could they deal with the pain?

[Pre-Chorus: Erik Bickerstaffe]
I knew
It was mine too
And you?
Is it really you?

[Chorus: Kadeem France]
Let's search the sky for a while
You and I
Collide like two stars for a while
You and I
[Verse 2: Erik Bickerstaffe]
Crushed by silent snow
Not the first, I know
Caught in ebb and flow
I’m bleeding out, oh, you know
[Interlude]
Name a few dimensions
We can flow between with no obstructions
Another timeline, I'd give anything to find
Adorned by countless souls seeking, further untold
At this winter, you will be
And if I join you there, you will ask me
"Is it really you?"
[Chorus: Kadeem France]
Let's search the sky for a while
You and I
Collide like two stars for a while
