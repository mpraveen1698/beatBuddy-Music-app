32 ContributorsPain Lyrics[Intro]
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no

[Chorus]
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa

[Verse 1]
I think my vision's gettin' blurry, swear the reaper's in a hurry
Yeah, I say I got no worries, but feels like nothing's gonna cure me
I don't really know why, been so damn sick of this ride
Just want off so I can feel normal for once
Fantasize about grippin' the gun, yeah

[Pre Chorus]
And I got lots of problems, medicated, solve 'em
Slowly I been falling, slowly I been falling
I got lots of problems, medicated, solve 'em
Slowly I been falling, slowly I been falling, no, no

Voices all in my head, I don't want no more pain
Voices all in my head, I don't want no more

[Chorus]
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa

[Verse 2]
I've been living by myself, my parents sayin, "Find help"
But therapy is kinda scary, yeah, that's what my brain repelled
I've been living sedentary, driving past the cemetery
Couple feet right from my house, if that's the end, then I want out

[Pre Chorus]
And I got lots of problems, medicated, solve 'em
Slowly I been falling, slowly I been falling
I got lots of problems, medicated, solve 'em
Slowly I been falling, slowly I been falling, no, no
[Bridge]
Voices all in my head, I don't want no more pain
Voices all in my head, I don't want no more

[Chorus]
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Pain goes by when you just don't think about
When you just don't think about it, no
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa

[Outro]
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
Can you save me?9Embed Pain Fearless Josh A emo
