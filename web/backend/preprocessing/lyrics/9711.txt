The bass, the rock, the mic, the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
With the bass, the rock, the mic, the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
Cause I can't wait for you to fuck me up
In a minute, minute, in a fuckin' minute
I can't wait for you to fuck me up
In a minute, minute, in a second

[Chorus]
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

[Post-Chorus]
Oooh, la la la
Oooh, la la la
Oooh, la la la
Oooh

[Bridge]
I don't find it funny right now (right now)
Just want my ma-ma-ma-money right now (now)
I'm on my way to the party right now (right now)
I don't find it funny right now (right now)
Just want my ma-ma-ma-money right now (now)
I'm on my way to the party right now (right now)
Because the break, the break, the break
[Chorus]
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
