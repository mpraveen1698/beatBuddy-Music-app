Every endless word
I have nothing here
Sick of all that was
Tired of all that is
Every hated love
I have broken in
Sick of fucking up
Tired of falling in

[Pre-Chorus]
And all that I regret
I have before, I will again

[Chorus]
It's over now
Are you running away?
I come apart
As I lie in your way
It's in my blood
Let the sky fall down
I won't let go
My oblivion

[Verse 2]
Counting every breath
I am my own fear
Nothing ever was
Nothing ever is
Every halo lost
I am worn within
Nothing left to hurt
Nothing left to live

[Chorus]
It's over now
Are you running away?
I come apart
As I lie in your way
It's in my blood
Let the sky fall down
I won't let go
My oblivion

[Bridge]
Face the monster I've become
I'm falling down
Hate won't let me go
In the ground, we rise to burn
I'm caving in
Life won't let me live
Forgive my heart

[Outro]
It's over now
I come apart
It's in my blood
Let the sky fall down
I won't let go
My oblivion6Embed Blood Ember Breaking Benjamin grunge
