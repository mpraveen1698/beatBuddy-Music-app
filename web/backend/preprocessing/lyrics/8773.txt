Can you hear my heartbeat?
Tired of feeling never enough
I close my eyes and tell myself
That my dreams will come true

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be no more darkness
When you believe in yourself, you are unstoppable
Where your destiny lies, dancing on the blades
You set my heart on fire

[Chorus]
Don't stop us now, the moment of truth
We were born to make history
We'll make it happen, we'll turn it around
Yes, we were born to make history

[Post-Chorus]
Born to make history
Bo-bo-born to make history

[Chorus]
Don't stop us now, the moment of truth
We were born to make history
We'll make it happen, we'll turn it around
Yes, we were born to make history
