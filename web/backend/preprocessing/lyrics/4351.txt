17 ContributorsWarned You Lyrics[Verse 1]
He looked to me, it's no surprise
And I
Well, I
I could die

[Chorus]
But I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you

[Verse 2]
And if I ever look surprised
Well, I
I'm not trying
To lie

[Chorus]
But I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned youYou might also like8Embed Warned You Shawcross Good Morning garage
