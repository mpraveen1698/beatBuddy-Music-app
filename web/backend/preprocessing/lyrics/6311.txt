2 ContributorsEverytime We Touch (Verano Radio Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dream
Forgive me, my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you, it's hard to survive

[Chorus]
'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry)
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

[Chorus]
'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life
