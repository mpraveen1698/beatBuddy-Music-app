Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

[Verse 2]
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

[Bridge]
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, "Please adore me"
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold

[Verse 3]
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

[Verse 2]
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

[Bridge]
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, "Please adore me"
And I looked, the moon had turned to gold

[Verse 3]
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

[Outro]
