Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved and be love?

[Verse 1: Bob Marley]
Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya! Oh, no!
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell, if what you're thinking isn't right!
Love would never leave us alone
A-in the darkness, there must come out to light

[Chorus: Bob Marley]
Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved, woah, yeah
And be loved?

[Bridge: I Threes]
The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you

[Refrain: Bob Marley & I Threes]
Love your brotherman!
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?

Don't let them change ya, oh!
Or even rearrange ya!
Oh, no!
We've got a life to live
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
They say, only, only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive, eh

[Chorus: Bob Marley]
Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, woah yeah!
And be loved?

[Bridge: I Threes]
Never miss your water until your well runs dry
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied
