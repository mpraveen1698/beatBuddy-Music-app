Walking on a dream
How can I explain?
Talking to myself
Will I see again?

[Pre-Chorus]
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

[Chorus]
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one

[Verse 2]
Thought I'd never see
The love you found in me
Now it's changing all the time
Living in a rhythm where the minute's working over time

[Pre-Chorus]
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one

[Bridge]
Catch me, I'm falling down
Catch me, I'm falling down

[Verse 3]
Don't stop, just keep going on
I'm your shoulder, lean upon
So come on, deliver from inside
All we got is tonight, that is right 'till first light

[Chorus]
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one34Embed Walking On A Dream Walking On A Dream (10th Anniversary Edition) Empire of the Sun alternative
