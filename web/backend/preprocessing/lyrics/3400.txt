23 ContributorsLast Request Lyrics[Verse 1]
Slow down, lie down
Remember it's just you and me
Don't sell out, bow out
Remember how this used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Baby, let's get closer, tonight

[Chorus]
Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure, I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me

[Verse 2]
Oh, an' I've found, that I'm bound
To wander down that one-way road
Oh, and I realise all about your lies
But I'm no wiser than the fool that I was before

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Baby, let's get closer, tonight

But one last time let's go there
Oh, lay down beside me

[Bridge]
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Tell me how can, how can this be wrong?

[Chorus]
Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure, I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me
Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders, no
Lay down beside me
And sure, I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me
[Outro]
Oh, oh
Yeah, lay down beside
One last time let's go there
Lay down beside me5Embed Last Request These Streets Paolo Nutini british
