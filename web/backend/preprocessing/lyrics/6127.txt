5 ContributorsWhat a Diffâ€™rence a Day Made LyricsWhat a difference a day made
Twenty-four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain

My yesterday was blue dear
Today I'm a part of you dear
My lonely nights are through dear
Since you said you were mine

Lord, what a difference a day made
Theres a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss;
That thrilling kiss

It's heaven when you
Find romance on your menu
What a difference a day made
And the difference is youYou might also like1Embed What A Diff'rence A Day Made What A Diff'rence A Day Makes! (Expanded Edition) Dinah Washington blues
