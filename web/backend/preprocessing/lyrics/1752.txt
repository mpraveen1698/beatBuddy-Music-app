14 ContributorsHeaven Lyrics[Intro]
Hmm

[Verse 1]
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how Heaven, Heaven
Could be better than this

[Verse 2]
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how Heaven, Heaven
Could be better than this
Could be better than this

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how Heaven, Heaven
Could be better than this (Heaven)
Could be better than this (Heaven, Heaven)
