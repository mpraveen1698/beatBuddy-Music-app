I go to bed with these thoughts that I can't control
They're feeding on my brain like a cannibal
I wake up right before I find the antidote
And now there's one more chance left to crack the code

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe]
So I keep digging deeper 'til I
Find out what's underneath
When you pull the mask back and you're all alone
Tell me, do you like what you see?

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe, Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
Yeah, you're empty, you're hollow
The fakest one that I know
If you think that you're special
Well, there's your fucking problem
And whеn it all comes crashing down
There's no onе left to save you now
You're so fake, fake fake, fake, fake
Fake

[Verse 2: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe]
Well, every goddamn day it's another low
Make one false move that's your cover blown
The repercussions are yours and yours alone
You can hide from the world but not for long

And when it all comes crashing down
There's no one left to save you now

[Bridge: Eric Vanlerberghe]
So inauthentic, uninspired
Say goodbye, your time's expired
I am so sick and tired
Of all your self-righteous shit
(Oh, you're so fucking fake)
