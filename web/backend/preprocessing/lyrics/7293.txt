I've been here for three nights
Forgetting what it used to be like
To sleep in and not hear you breathing
You life is so easy to be in
If we could just freeze time
Pretend that you have always been mine
The second I leave you, we’re all done
Go back to pretending I'm no one

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm wondering how
I’m everything and then nothing

[Chorus]
How are you so detached?
When I'm outta your sight I'm outta your mind
Forget what we had
From so in the present to stuck in thе past
How are you so detached?

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna lеave you tomorrow
'Cause when I leave you never follow
This object ain't permanent, is it?
'Cause when it's not there you don’t miss it
Swear there was a red string
Connecting a piece of you to me
But I’m guessing I just misread that
I heard that can happen with contact
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm wondering how
I’m everything and then nothing

[Chorus]
How are you so detached?
When I'm outta your sight I'm outta your mind
Forget what we had
From so in the present to stuck in the past
How are you so detached?

[Outro]
How are you so detached?
How are you so detached?
How are you so detached?
How are you so detached?1Embed Detached Detached Lyn Lapid songwriter
