1 ContributorNumb Lyrics(Verse 1)

I'm tired of being what
You want me to be
Feeling so faithless
Lost under the surface

You don't know what
You're expecting of me
Put under the pressure
Of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow
Just caught in the undertow
And every step that I
Take is another mistake to you

I-I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
I've become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this

All I want to do
Is be morе like me
And be lеss like you
You

Can't you see that
You're smothering me?
You're holding too tightly
Afraid to lose control

'Cause everything that
You thought I would be
Is falling apart right
In front of you

Caught in the undertow
Just caught in the undertow

Every step that I take is
Another mistake to you
And every second I waste
Is more than I can take

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
I've become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this-
All I want to do is be more like me
And be less like you
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there

I've become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this

All I want to do is
Be more like me
And be less like youEmbed Numb Numb Arc North;Aaron Richards;New Beat Order;Cour edm
