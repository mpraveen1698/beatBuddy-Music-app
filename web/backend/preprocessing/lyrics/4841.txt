48 ContributorsNice Boys Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ain't it just so easy to say
You don't feel the same way
As that Nice Boy does, bae?
He misses you, he wants you, but
You just don't feel the same
Why don't you tell him today?
Yeah, huh-huh-huh

[Verse 2]
She doesn't want him because he cares too much
But now he's gone and she's alone again
Maybe if she tried a little harder to find
The gem within his heart that was there this whole time
(Bitch!)

[Bridge]
Baby, what can I do?
Baby, come through
To me
Baby, I think it's you
Never was me

[Outro]
