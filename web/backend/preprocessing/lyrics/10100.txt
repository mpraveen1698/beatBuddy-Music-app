It's been a minute since we met
But I still think you're out of my league
I could never understand how
Someone like you would love
Somebody like me

[Verse 1]
I don't know why you put me first
Introduced me to my worth
Showed me how to love myself
Make me feel like there's nobody else
You say it's all a part of love
That we don't ever need to rush
See it's supposed to be easy and I know that
I'll always be keeping you close, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm feeling like I'm always dreamin'
I don't know how you're just my type
Do what you're doin', I can't get enough
I'll try to measure up, yeah

[Chorus]
It's been a minute since we met
But I still think you're out of my league
I could never understand how
Someone like you would love
Somebody like me

My heart is beatin' out my chest
Somethin' I never asked for
You give it all you give more, yeah

I'm feeling like I'm always dreamin'
I don't know how you're just my type
Do what you're doin', I can't get enough
I'll try to measure up, yeah-yeah
