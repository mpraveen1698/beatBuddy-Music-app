Diamonds, they fade
Your words are sinking
Down, down in my chest
What are you thinking?

[Chorus]
I don't know you anymore
We're alone now, now
And before you go
Just turn off the lights

[Post-Chorus]
Just turn off the lights
Just turn off the lights

[Chorus]
I don't know you anymore
We're alone now, now
And before you go
Just turn off the lights

[Post-Chorus]
Just turn off the lights
