I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm lookin' up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

[Chorus]
I've been having dreams
Trip and I fall in
I've been having dreams
I've been having dreams

[Verse 2]
Splashin' in a summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushin' weight of paradise
Solid block of gold
Lying in the cold
I feel right at home, oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so–5Embed Trampoline - Jauz Remix Trampoline (Jauz Remix) SHAED;Jauz electro
