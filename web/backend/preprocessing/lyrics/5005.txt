You got me second guessing everything (You mess me up, you mess me up)
Smoking away all the pain (I'm rolling up, I'm rolling up)
I'm taking shots to drown these memories (I'm drowning now, I'm drowning now)
I shoulda never gave you the key to my soul, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be your lover
Don't wanna be your friend
Wish we could be forever
But I know this ain't it

[Chorus]
For now I'll be stuck in this beautiful nightmare
'Til you come back, I'll be standing right here
Do I ever cross your mind?
You used to be something like a beautiful daisy
But now you'rе like a rose with your thorns, how you hurt me
Do I еver cross your mind anymore?

[Verse 2]
Used to be lovers, now we enemies (You mess me up, you mess me up)
There really ain't much left that I could say (I'm rolling up, I'm rolling up)
I need some medicine to numb the pain (I'm drowning now, I'm drowning now)
I shoulda never gave you the key to my soul, yeah

I wanna be your lover
Don't wanna be your friend
Wish we could be forever
But I know this ain't it

[Chorus]
For now I'll be stuck in this beautiful nightmare
'Til you come back, I'll be standing right here
Do I ever cross your mind?
You used to be something like a beautiful daisy
But now you're like a rose with your thorns how you hurt me
Do I ever cross your mind anymore?

[Bridge]
Do you ever?
Do you ever dream about us together?
Do you ever?
Want forever but this ain't it

[Chorus]
For now I'll be stuck in this beautiful nightmare
'Til you come back, I'll be standing right here
Do I ever cross your mind?
You used to be something like a beautiful daisy
But now you're like a rose with your thorns how you hurt me
Do I ever cross your mind anymore?6Embed Anymore XOXO JEON SOMI k-pop
