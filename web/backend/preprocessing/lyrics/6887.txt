17 ContributorsMerry Christmas Everyone Lyrics[A]
Snow is falling all around me
Children playing, having fun
It's the season, love and understanding
Merry Christmas everyone

[A1]
Time for parties and celebration
People dancing all night long
Time for presents and exchanging kisses
Time for singing Christmas songs

[B]
We're gonna have a party tonight
I'm gonna find that girl
Underneath the mistletoe
We'll kiss by candlelight

[A2]
Room is swaying, records playing
All the old songs we love to hear
All I wish that every day was Christmas
What a nice way to spend the year
Woo, yeah!

[B]
We're gonna have a party tonight
I'm gonna find that girl
Underneath the mistletoe
We'll kiss by candlelight
