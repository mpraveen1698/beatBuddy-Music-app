4 ContributorsWhat It Takes Lyrics[Verse 1]
My mind is racing, heart is pacing
Everything I want, I taste it, I embrace it
Gotta have the patience, dedication
Never leave a moment wasted, chasing greatness
I think it's kinda funny that they slept on me
Here's a couple things they should know about me
No Plan B, just a one-way ticket
This is what it takes, that's the difference

[Chorus]
I been waiting for this all my life, it's my time
I never hesitate, I take down, stand my ground
Look at all the valleys that I made it through
You're looking at somebody with too much to lose
The sacrifice is made everyday, it's the price I pay
This is what it takes

[Post-Chorus]
Eyes on the prize, yeah, this is what it takes (This is what it takes)
Eyes on the prize when it's make or break (This is what it takes)
Eyes on the prize, yeah, this is what it takes, this is what it takes

[Verse 2]
The way I play, it's calculated
Gonna take the game and change it, fuck the haters
Turn the blood 'n sweat 'n tears to gold
When you break the mold and get results
Here we go
