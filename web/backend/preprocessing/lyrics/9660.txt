I could take every fucking word she said
Throw it in her face
Would she even care?
I still remember when she looked at me
That frown upon her face
Trying to be sincere

I gathered all those little things she said
Kept them close to me
Trying to make this real
This cloud will always hover over me
I'm leaving you today
'Cause now I see

[Chorus]
Suffocate, you suffocate
That you lie (I don't lie)
That you're fake (I'm not fake)
Suffocate, you suffocate
You always take (I don't take)
What you can (What I can)

[Verse 2]
I could take every fucking game you play
Blow it all away
Would you even care?
I could take all those lies you said to me
Never go away
Never disappear
This cloud will always hover over me
I'm leaving you today
'Cause now I see
You might also like[Chorus]
Suffocate, you suffocate
That you lie (I don't lie)
That you're fake (I'm not fake)
Suffocate, you suffocate
You always take (I don't take)
What you can (What I can)

Suffocate, you suffocate
That you lie (I don't lie)
That you're fake (I'm not fake)

[Bridge]
Now I'm far away from you (You're always far away)
I'll never bring back yesterday (Bring back yesterday)
You're such a fake, it's true (Hey)
I can't believe the words you say
I'm far away from you
I'll never bring back yesterday

[Chorus]
Suffocate, you suffocate
That you lie (I don't lie)
That you're fake (I'm not fake)
Suffocate, you suffocate
You always take (I don't take)
What you can (What I can)
[Outro]
I always take what I can
That you lie (I don't lie)
That you're fake (I'm not fake)

I always take what I can
That you lie (I don't lie)
That you're fake (I'm not fake)1Embed Suffocate Year Of The Spider Cold industrial
