10 ContributorsLegends Aren’t Made Lyrics[Intro]
(How am I supposed to love you?)
When I don't love who I am
(And how can I give you all of me?)
(When I'ma only half a men)
('Cause I’m sinking ship that's burning)
(So let go of my hand)
(And how can I give you all of me?)
Harlem Production
(When I'm only half a man) Yo, look
(How am I supposed to love you?)

[Verse 1]
So who do they want me to be?
I'm tryna make a difference
But my mother stopping me
No, the hate doesn't bother me
The reason you ain't get that apology
I'm the type of change you don’t wanna see
Want Drake to address me
So I'm buying them properties
Grеatest in the end, man, I’vе got to be
Sleeping while the class learn Geography
Give me better beats and you’re gonna see
The rap game I’ll turn a monopoly
Surrounded by game changers
No wannabees, sorry mum for ruining my shoes
Playing football in wallabies
Adding onto bills that you have to pay
Your saddest day is my gateway
And you still see me laugh a lot
And I tried to cry, but it didn’t work
Threw sticks and stones but they didn’t hurt
Funny if you die gotta live it
First, this gift I was given from birth
Get all of my love in the dirt
Lost a brother he’s in a better place
Got away from pain I can’t get away
They say the world works in a strange way
Nowadays you’re paying for slimmer waists
You came from God’s eye, not a dinner plate
I used to feel pain, and it bothered me
Now I don’t free pain and it bothers me
Satan’s really hitting the lotteries, including you
And me man, he’s got a piece you’ve gotta let it go
If you want peace
You might also like[Chorus]
Dealing with pain that I can explain
Living life in the darkest way
I'm not sure how much my heart can take
Lord forgive me, but my scars are great
Do forgive me if my heart turns grey
Dealing with pain that I can explain
Living life in the darkest way
I'm not sure how much my heart can take
Lord forgive me, but my scars are great
Do forgive me if my heart turns grey

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows I’m not in the mood
If I’m out the house, I’m still in the booth
I’m too busy tryna give you the truth
Learnt from history you see how I move
Called me home but I still saw how you moved
I'm doing this for Ilford
I'm repping home for the one time
Bane, life was hell, so I still don’t know what the sun’s like
I skip church I guess you’ll call me the dark knight
Christian on bail you should know me flow is slippy as hell
Suicidal thoughts two ways I couldn’t live with myself
If your bars are on the table
I guess mine are on a different shelf
For the people man the difference helps
As long as I’m alive and I’m well
The lives we both live ain’t equal
I’m just tryna provide for my people
I pray my times due like Hebrew
The hood ain’t home man it’s evil
As soon as people got it, they don’t need you
I’m tryna win the world over, Inzaghi
Tryna make sales like the mali’s
Tryna turn my clay’s into Ali
My heart is on the line you Joe Hart me
Love won’t save us
Legends aren’t made, God makes us
[Chorus]
Dealing with pain that I can explain
Living life in the darkest way
I'm not sure how much my heart can take
Lord forgive me, but my scars are great
Do forgive me if my heart turns grey
Dealing with pain that I can explain
Living life in the darkest way
I'm not sure how much my heart can take
Lord forgive me, but my scars are great
Do forgive me if my heart turns greyEmbed Legends Aren't Made Legends Aren't Made Dan chill
