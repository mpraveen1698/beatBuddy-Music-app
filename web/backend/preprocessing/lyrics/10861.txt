8 Contributorsâ€‹bluebonnets Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wish I woulda crashed my car on the day that I met you
Would've been better than the shit that I went through
Tell me 'bout your friends passed out in the restroom
Thought it was settled, guess we were on different levels
You like the watch with the bezel
I like the time when it's special
I'd wait on you for forever
I couldn't do any better, okay nah
But I just thought it meant more when

[Chorus]
You left all your bluebonnets on my nightstand
Changed all my flight plans
Lost where the night went
You left all your bluebonnets on my nightstand
Had too many options
Lost your heart to Boston

[Verse 2]
Yeah when I met you we were both on drugs
Didn't know enough
Didn't talk too much and maybe
You might have forgotten who I was
You been on the run
What you running from now, baby?
Like ooh, no other
Yeah, you know that these bitches can't touch ya
Like ooh, no wonder
But I just thought it meant more when
You might also like[Chorus]
You left all your bluebonnets on my nightstand
Changed all my flight plans
Lost where the night went
You left all your bluebonnets on my nightstand
Had too many options
Lost your heart to Boston

[Outro]
You left these traces on my clothes
Fuck searching on
Didn't have to go
Did you know
You left these traces on my clothes
Fuck searching on
Didn't have to go
Did you know1Embed bluebonnets bluebonnets Austin George sad
