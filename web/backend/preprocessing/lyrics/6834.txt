1 ContributorRiptide LyricsI was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, they come unstuck

Lady, running down to thе riptide
Taken away to the dark sidе
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
You might also likeI was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreamEmbed Riptide Riptide VAX swedish
