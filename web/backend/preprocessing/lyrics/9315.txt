14 ContributorsDebonaire Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't need diamond rings or high-priced suits that shine
Limousines and flashing things or ancient bottled wine
Designer names and lavish things and million-dollar hair
Modern dames without a brain, I never really care

[Chorus]
I don't care nothin' about it
Woah, yeah!

[Verse 2]
I don't care for glitzy things or a fancy neighborhood
Glamour games or plastic fame or the king of Hollywood
Dazzling flamboyant things or a top hat on my head
Or modeling for magazines or to be a debonaire

[Chorus]
I don't care nothin' about it
Woah, yeah, woah, yeah!
Woah, yeah, woah
I don't care nothin' about it
Woah, yeah, woah
I don't care nothin' about it
Woah, yeah, woah, yeah!
Woah, yeah, woahYou might also likeEmbed Debonaire Felons and Revolutionaries Dope industrial
