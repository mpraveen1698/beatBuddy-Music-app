(JK, really?)
(Hey Ross, sauce it up)
Yeah

[Chorus]
Tired of the mess I've made
I been fed up, keep my head up, but I can not
The more I feel love
Then the less I change
Wanna be alone
But I'm feeling land locked

[Verse 1]
Waited all my life to take that chance
Toured around the world, still a failure in my eyes
Looking back, all alone, cannot hide the stress
Way before I knew about it I was in my prime
Rollin' something in the night
Made my pain go poof, I stay in reclusе
Don't need friends,  all yall fake
I need cash, I need space
Told mysеlf I'm good enough but I'm lying to my face, yeah

[Chorus]
Tired of the mess I've made
I been fed up, keep my head up, but I can not
The more I feel love
Then the less I change
Wanna be alone
But I'm feeling land locked
Tired of the mess I've made
I been fed up, keep my head up, but I can not
The more I feel love
Then the less I change
Wanna be alone
But I'm feeling land locked

Yeah
Probably die before I wake
If I don't, listen up
Something in my head saying
Yeah
Probably die before I wake
If I don't, listen up
Something in my head saying

[Chorus]
Tired of the mess I've made
I been fed up, keep my head up, but I can not
The more I feel love
Then the less I change
Wanna be alone
But I'm feeling land locked1Embed MESS MAYBE NEXT YEAR Justin Stone sad
