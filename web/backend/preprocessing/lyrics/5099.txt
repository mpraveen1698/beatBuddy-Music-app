A company, always on the run
Our destiny, oh, it's the rising sun
I was a born, a shotgun in my hand
Behind the gun, I'll make my final stand, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's why they call me...

[Chorus]
Bad company
I can't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

[Verse 2]
Rebel souls; "deserters," we've been called
Chose a gun and threw away the sun
Now these towns, well, they all know our name
The Death Punch sound is our claim to fame

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's why they call me...
[Chorus]
Bad company
I can't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

[Bridge]
Eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Blood for blood
We've all gotta die
We've all gotta die

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's why they call me...

[Chorus]
Bad company
I won't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die
Bad company
I won't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I dieSee Five Finger Death Punch LiveGet tickets as low as $27You might also like8Embed Bad Company War is the Answer Five Finger Death Punch groove
