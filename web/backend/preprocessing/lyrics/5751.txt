Uh, I feel like god, I'm a kage (whoa)
Busted my ass, had no off days (whoa)
Me, I been working, I grind from the ground up
Now you see my drip is hokage, uh
Kage, kage
No tailed beast, Kisame
Never had breaks no off days
Bitch my drip ho(kage)-

[Bridge]
Look, boy I'm a legend, best bow in my presence
Don't test me I'm ready, my drip like hokage
See you and I we both had nothing in common
I move like kakashi, I do shit about it

[Verse]
Let's go, let's go, young shinobi from the unknown
Said I got to show them I'm with it I got guts though
Nine tails fox I kill them we all cut throats
Had to put the work in, show them what the work is
Came up from the bottom, now I'm up though
Ay, stuck up from the trеnches now I'm on my lit shit
I'm get serious onе punch hoe, uh
What the fuck? Ayy
Cuss out the race, got to show 'em I ain't playing
When I amp up the stakes
High like a satellite, we could get it scrapping
Right they ain't with the team, we could run up the fade
Started out a young leaf masters
The one thing fast with the team they love what I say
Whenever I'm showing up, no one as cold as us
Guarantee I'ma go fuck up the game
Kage uh, kage uh
Running from the bottom to the top place, yea
I'm little ninja from the village here my way
Now their trying to copy like Kakashi doing cosplay
Put in the work, got me feeling like, "Yahway"
Y'all waiting for the messiah, I'm with the god play
Y'all better stop, y'all better watch
Came through flood, got my drip hokage, uhYou might also like1Embed Naruto Bluebird Freestyle Naruto Bluebird Freestyle Khantrast sad
