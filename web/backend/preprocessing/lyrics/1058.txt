[Intro: Kaya Scodelario, ZayBeKillinIT]
Freddie, I don't want them here. I thought I did, I thought that was me, but
I-I don't know what it is, but I know you're the only person I can trust
Aah, I'm just hyped that he's here bro, we got glaive back at it

[Verse 1]
I think I love you, but I don't wanna waste away
I love you, and I wish there was another way
But I can't think straight again
And I can't betray my friends
(Stop, me too)
(I'm like, I need to enter my ovine hall era)
(It's about time I leave my couch)
At all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all
And I can't betray my friends
Three weeks later, screamin', cryin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Best-believe that I'm trying
I'm trying not to cross that line
I'm lying, like the last one thousand times
I've lived a thousand lives
Best-believe that I'm trying
I'm trying not to cross that line
I'm lying, like the last one thousand times
I've lived a thousand lives

And I already know how you and I will work out
Two kids with a mortgage, bungalow in Shoreditch
Neither of us want that, you and I will work out
Two kids with a mortgage, bungalow in Shoreditch

Two kids with a mortgage, bungalow in Shoreditch
And I already know how, you and I will work out
Two kids with a mortgage, bungalow in Shoreditch
Neither of us wa—

Part III: Lucid Dreams (Hardstyle) - Juice WRLD

[Verse]
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart—
[Outro]
I'm not a huge fan of how that song drops, so we're just gonna skip that part, um, I, um, thank you for listening, here's the next one

For you, I don't mind, for you, I don't mind
(I, I have nothing left to, I have nothing left to)

Part V: session 0777777777777r21qffffffff jkopüswedxywy w333333r - mental hospital

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please, don't go," and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please, don't go," and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"

Part VI: Call It Karma - Silverstein

[Verse]
(Hi Dopa)
Blame it on the weather, but I'm a mess (Slowsilver03)
And this February darkness has me hating everyone
And I know I need your comfort
But this drama makes me sick
And the longer I lay here
I know it's harder to get up without you

[Chorus]
Lose another day here
Lose another year here, I'm with John

[Drop]

[Verse]
Blame it on the weather, but I'm a mess
And this February darkness has me hating everyone
And I know I need your comfort
But this drama makes me sick
And the longer I lay here
I know it's harder to get up

[Outro: Luke Pasqualino]
Nothing bad is going to happen
Yeah, I'm going to take care of you now, right, I promise
Part VII: JUDGEMENT DAY - Kasper Gem

[Intro]
Shut the, shut the fuck up. Oh my God, Holy flying fuck this shit

[Verse 1]
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
That's my bro, that's my bro so imma break the bread in two
If you sayin' that you love me, oh my god I love you too
Oh my god if we get caught up with the fye don't tell the truth
I know that you're lying, see it coming out your teeth
But I guess that it's alright cause I'm so used to you and me
I don't wanna fight it's the same color when we bleed
I'm bleeding red nova G.A.N.G gang
I'm with CJ going stupid, he so crazy
I'm the blueprint, nobody made me
Bitch I made them, they my baby
Watch my shoe split Margiela Tabi

[Chorus]
Why are you mad at me?
It's so sad to see, we could be happy
It's a tragedy, judgement day
I really hope you let me in them gates
I really hope you let me in them gates

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of shit that I could say to you
But I still pray to you
I really wanna see your face to know if it's true
Stay in present day I cannot worry if it's through
Ignore the mess I made, I feel so home up in your room
Told that girl don't celebrate yet 'cause the break is coming soon
Yeah I don't know what you mean it's overhead just like a roof
You missed the proof

[Chorus]
Why are you mad at me?
It's so sad to see, we could be happy
It's a tragedy, judgement day
I really hope you let me in them gates
Judgement day, Judgement day
I really hope you let me in them gates

Part VIII: Dial Drunk - Noah Kahan

[Verse 1]
I'm rememberin' I promised to forget you now
But it's rainin' and I'm callin' drunk
And my medicine is drowning your perspective out
So I ain't taking any fault
Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be?
I doubt it, forget about it, whatever
It's all the same anyways

[Chorus]
I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that, when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang, even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'll die for you

[Verse 2]
I'm untethering from the parts of me you'd recognize
From charming to alarming in seconds
I'll be bedridden, I'll let the pain metastasize
But, that's morning, I'll forget it
And the dial tone is all I have

[Chorus]
I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that, when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang, even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you
Well, I'd die for you

[Bridge]
Thank you, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag
Just wait, I swear she'll call me back
Oh, son, are you a danger to yourself?
Well, fuck that sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll kiss the badge
Just wait, I swear she'll call me back
Son, why do you do this to yourself?
And I said

[Chorus]
"I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know (I no longer know)
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that, when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang, even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you"

Part IX: Squid - Bugs

[Intro]
You're not my buddy
My nose is bloody
Stakes raised like someone is conducting
Like a freight train, you know I keep chugging
Reflection polluted, it's murky and mucky
Bobbing my head up, punching and ducking
The way that it's set up, I'm feeling quite lucky
Spent like three years on a pipe dream
I don't care if you don't like me

[Bridge]
It's all bruised up, it's unsightly
Stretch their hands out, then they bite me
Gon' be a man down if they try me
They better stay back for the time being

[Pre-Chorus]
They stay on weird timing
If they don't care then they're lying
Gonna go nowhere with all that crying
Some days feel like

[Chorus]
We might dance around and die
Leave a message in the sky
And I don't even know why I'm standing here
How you feel, you made it clear
Wish I made it outta here
We might dance around and die
Leave a message in the sky
And I don't even know why I'm standing here
How you feel, you made it clear
Wish I made it outta here

[Verse]
Right now they wanna talk down
Breeze past them like a top-down
You assume the worst, what is that about?
I don't know why you're talking now
I don't know why you're talking now
Time is running its course
I'm beaten down to the core
I hate the sound of my voice
Wish I could rip
That shit's corny

[Pre-Chorus]
They stay on weird timing
If they don't care then they're lying
Gonna go nowhere with all that crying
Some days feel like

[Chorus]
We might dance around and die
Leave a message in the sky
And I don't even know why I'm standing here
How you feel, you made it clear
Wish I made it outta here
We might dance around and die
Leave a message in the sky
And I don't even know why I'm standing here
How you feel, you made it clear
Wish I made it outta here

Part X: problems - glaive

[Verse 1]
And now I found myself inside a bottle on my shelf
And I made a couple songs for you, Joel
'Cause the last thing you told me was to give 'em hell
And now you ain't with me and it's clear to see
That I barely sleep and I barely eat
And when I heard that news, I could barely speak
And I guess Percocets are more important to you

[Chorus]
And I got problems and you have problems too
I said, "Fuck my life," I got a point to prove
You said, "Fuck this life," and popped a pill or two
I stay inside my room, I love the solitude
And I got problems and you have problems too
I said, "Fuck my life," I got a point to prove
You said, "Fuck this life," and popped a pill or two
I stay inside my room, I love the solitude

[Verse 2]
And she tells her friends that she's severely depressed
They say, "No you're not, I think it's all inside your head"
She just smoked a spliff and I can smell it on her breath
And her boyfriend doesn't love her, he loves smokin' cigarettes
Like oh, oh, oh, I know it kinda hurts to see me go, oh, oh
But we both needed space so we can grow, oh, oh
And I guess that it's a part of gettin', oh, oh, old, it's feeling cold

[Chorus]
And I got problems and you have problems too
I said, "Fuck my life," I got a point to prove
You said, "Fuck this life," and popped a pill or two
I stay inside my room, I love the solitude
And I got problems and you have problems too
I said, "Fuck my life," I got a point to prove
You said, "Fuck this life," and popped a pill or two
I stay inside my room, I love the solitude

[Outro]
That song is called "problems", um, never ask me to, I'm never gonna talk about it ever again
Part XI: Crazy Story, Pt. 3 - King Von

[Intro]
Oh, yeah, I'm finna make a banger with this
Huh, what?
(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger) Von

[Verse 1]
Now here it go
I just made it home, missed calls on my phone
See, I been gone
Was tryna hit a lick but that shit just went wrong
I got a thot
She right off the block, her crib be the spot
And we got Glocks
Tucked all in her shit, don't come in 'less you knock
But this bitch grimy
Told her 'bout this nigga, helped me set him up
And she was with it
She just want some shoes and she ain't give no fucks
So we do that
I was at his neck, creepin' from the back
But saw the opps and had to let 'em have it
How fucked up is that?
But where that bitch?
She ain't called me yet, we did that at six
And who got hit?
I know someone check 'cause King Von, he don't miss
Now two weeks pass
I'm back on my grind, I can't waste no time
The opps been quiet
They be woofin', though, but them niggas not slidin'
And I been high
I can't even lie, that thot been on my mind
Why she ain't called?
I ain't seen her ass, I hope that she aight
Now it's midnight
I'm hittin' some blocks, just me and my Glock
Came to a stop
I'm at a red light, I usually don't stop
My phone keep ringing
Just a ho, of course, this bitch prolly bored
I press ignore
I ain't got no time, a whore gon' be a whore
Now I get that feelin'
Something ain't right, I look to my right
And I'm like, damn
There go that flexing nigga, he wavin' his pipe
He get to dumpin'
Bullets get to comin', my heart get to thumpin'
I feel something
My left shoulder hot, blood just get to gushing
I'm like shit, ain't this 'bout a bitch?
And he with that bitch
I got a glimpse
She got them big lips that's made for sucking dick
Now it makes sense
That ho set me up, that lil' dirty slut
The double-cross
Tryna get me caught like I'm Randy Moss
Aw, shit
I just dropped my gun, plus I got one arm
I'm tryna drive
I can't shoot back now, this man on my ass
I almost crashed
But I got the wheel, he tryna kill for real
But there go 12
He bust a quick right and I just bust a left

[Interlude: King Von & O'Block Louie]
Aw, shit
What the fuck, gang, you good?
Damn, my shoulder
You know this bitch be fuckin' with me, gang
Damn, man, finish tellin' me about that shit that was crackin' off last week with them niggas and shit
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah, look
Now this what happened

[Verse 2]
A week later
My arm in a sling, I been sippin' lean
Pure codeine
I don't feel a thing, my ho say I'm mean
I need a blunt
Stuff that bitch with Runtz, boy, I'm on a hunt
And ain't no breakfast
But I'ma box a nigga, like some Cap'n Crunch
I got a tip
That that thot bitch be on 75th
Right off Cottage
With her best friend, gettin' her hair did
I'm like, cool
Finna make my move, post up what I do
This bitch a fool for tryna play me out
Like this shit was cool
Now it's like two
Catch her walkin' out, her new hairstyle blue
And she look cute
But that mean shit to me, I crept up then I boomed
And that was that
Now I'm running back, I stop in my tracks
There go that Porsche
How crazy is that? Boy, I'm on his ass
The first blast
It shatter his glass, damn, this nigga fast
He hit the gas
I'm still shootin' at him, but I'm too far back
Damn, I'm hyped
Let me tuck this pipe, get up out of sight
'Cause I see lights
And them bitches bright, can't go to jail for life
So I take flight
Made it to the hood, everything went good
Knock on wood
Flame me up a 'Wood, Tooka smellin' good
Looked at my phone
Got a text from Herb, he say, "What's the word?"
I say, "Shit, I'm just coolin', bitch
I'm not from 63rd"

[Outro]
Bitch, we not from 63rd
Stretch Gang put in work

Part XII: Alone (Ft. Lil Durk) - 42 Dugg

[Intro]
This one's for Piper, this next one's for Piper

[Chorus: 42 Dugg]
And you was supposed to hold me down
I wish I could see your smile
All that other shit don't mean nothin'
I came from hustlin'
And I still remember all the advice you ever gave me
How the fuck you goin' down when I was eighteen?
Wrong, you was wrong about a lot of shit, I'm on my own
I'm on my own, but I'll never quit, I'm doin' good
Double up and bring it to the hood, this shit for us
Tell me, how the fuck is it for us if I'm alone?

[Verse 1: 42 Dugg]
Still remember cryin' on the phone, me and Rece
I forever got your kid, my nigga, 'til we even
I swear I wanna quit, but, bro, I gotta keep goin'
They ain't got my back out here, I swear it's somethin' I know
Probably be happier to hear I'm goin' broke
I know for a fact, a couple million on a home
My head down, but shit been lookin' up for a minute
You always with your nigga, but you in love with me
Them cars paid and your house, boo, you can chill now, yeah
A hundred thousand ain't shit, I got them M's now, yeah
I never committed fraud
Five hundred cash, blow it all to see my dawg
Finally in my bag, niggas prayin' on me to fall
If it weren't for this rap shit, I'd still be sellin' raw
I know you notice progression, we fell out 'cause you was messy
Them killers know I been steppin' since a young nigga, still that one nigga

[Pre-Chorus: 42 Dugg]
Granny still cryin'
And my mama still

[Chorus: 42 Dugg & Lil Durk]
And you was supposed to hold me down

Wrong, you was wrong about a lot of shit, I'm on my own

Double up and bring it to the hood, this shit for us
Tell me, how the fuck is it for us if I'm alone? (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Did this twice, losin' four, five niggas in one summer, that ain't nothin' nice (That ain't nothin' nice)
Blamed for bodies, funeral home packed, but only hugged twice (Yeah)
Smellin' blood comin' from his body, that ain't nothin' nice (That ain't nothin' nice)
Hurt you more when killers that you love turned to a fuckin' mice (Let's get it)
Love me like I love you, bro (Love me like I love you)
Love me like you love these hoes (Love me like you love these hoes)
Love don't last in me for sure, they show they hand, they trade for sure
I helped when you was at your lowest, it seem like you ain't wanna grow (You ain't wanna grow)
Me and two with the world, you still ain't seem to make a show
I sent mail to the jail, they sent it back
Said gang signs was scratched out, they gave us hell
And they wanna take two years, I can't 'magine you with an L
How you feel? Give me chills, see I'm rappin', but I'm for real, yeah, yeah
We gon' get back, so if you see us, you better get back
Click, click-clack, his shit splat
Street nigga forever, I'm with whatever, come with that
Niggas dyin' if they with that, let's get it

[Pre-Chorus: 42 Dugg]
Granny still cryin'
And my mama still

[Chorus: 42 Dugg]
And you was supposed to hold me down
I wish I could see your smile
All that other shit don't mean nothin'
I came from hustlin'
And I still remember all the advice you ever gave me
How the fuck you goin' down when I was eighteen?
Wrong, you was wrong about a lot of shit, I'm on my own

[Intro]
HLD

(dit is weer een geweldig nummer gepresenteerd door g-g-glaive)

[Verse]
Seklenland, non c’est pas des lol
Un jour on fera l'tour du globe
J’fais une passe devant moi il y a l'globe
Pour l’instant les condés m'traquent à mort
Tu connais déjà, on vend la mort
3F réputé pour les com’
J’connais les pétards, emballe ton gom
Tu veux nous fumer mais gros tu dors
J’connais rate-pi qui choiera ton or
Quand j’s’rais mort ils diront qu’j’suis fort
Mes textes sont remplis d’métaphores
T’es-t’es boosté mais mon gars t’es pas fort
Tout seul dans ma bulle, nique tes morts
Tout seul dans ma bulle, nique tes morts
J’vais rentrer pépettes pendant qu’tu dors
Il y en a plus d’un qui ont peur d’la mort
Il y en a plus d’un qui m’écoutent en scred
J’suis dans la ville gros pet’ au bec
Demande à Coyote wAllah j’les baise
On suce pas on est pas des dé-p’
Maman pleure à six heures ça pète
J’envoie les ballons comme Phil Foden
Tous les jours mon gava faut qu’ça becte
Tous les jours mon gava faut qu’ça becte
J’finis au tel-ho avec mon ex
Libérer mon gava SLS
J’pense à lui dans l’auto quand j’suis sten
Plus fort qu’eux il y a zéro suspens
Plus fort qu’eux il y a zéro suspens
J’barode dans la ville, active mode S
Mon gava on sait faire l’oseille
Et wAllah on t’éteint pour l’oseille
Il y a que pour les passes dé’ que j’prends l’bus
Les condés veulent remont’ la puce
J’la baise fort elle dit "H t’abuses"
Tu fais le chaud au volant vu qu’ta bu
On les connais c’est des vrai acteurs
HLD il envoie de la pure
Tu veux baiser mais ta chatte elle pue
C’est connu, sans pitié on n’a pas de cœur
J’suis zehef comme un gars qui prend 10 ans
Ça t’allume ta mère à bout portant
Il y a du nouveau kamas, tiens l'echant
On t’encule ta mère si on descend
Ça déboule et tes gars ils déchantent
Pourtant dans la clique on n’est pas cinquante
J’envoi un ti-peu pour la cinquante
J’allume un gros kamas dans la planque

[Chorus]
J’ai vendu ma me-ca dans tous les coins d'Paris
J’ai plus de deux cents chevaux, salope tu peux pas rivalise'
Tous les vendredi j’suis en qamis
Ils ont plus d’inspiration, donc ces batards ils recopient
J’vis-ser les babtou et Qataris
Elle écarte, elle fait pas la timide
J’ai vendu ma me-ca dans tous les coins d'Paris
J’ai plus de deux cents chevaux, salope tu peux pas rivalise'
Tous les vendredi j’suis en qamis
Ils ont plus d’inspiration, donc ces bâtards ils recopient
J’vis-ser les babtou et Qataris
Elle écarte, elle fait pas la timide

[Outro]
Paw, paw

Part XV: never let you leave - kmoe

[Verse 1]
She said she wanna see me, I just got off a flight (Got off a flight)
I don't wanna leave the house, girl, come spend the night (Come spend the night)
If it's not a problem, then I think I just might (Think I just might)
Never let you leave my arms again (Again)

[Chorus]
I can never fall asleep when I'm without you now
I miss you endlessly, you're all I care about
And when you're under me, I'm drowning
In your hazel eyes, pull me right in

[Verse 2]
Stab me in the back, I turn a blind eye
Girl I'll do anything for you, won't ask why
It's just so hard to take my eyes off you tonight
Maybe I'm wrong and might be dumb, but that's alright
I know you pick yourself apart for me
See right through the dark in me
You change your clothes, but is that really who you wanna be?
You took my heart from me (You took my heart from me)
Now I can't fall asleep

[Chorus]
I can never fall asleep when I'm without you now
I miss you endlessly, you're all I care about
And when you're under me, I'm drowning
In your hazel eyes, pull me right in
I can never fall asleep when I'm without you now
I miss you endlessly, you're all I care about
And when you're under me, I'm drowning
In your hazel eyes, pull me right in

Interlude
Okay, for the interlude section of this, this set
We're gonna be talking to my good friend, Adam, thr6x
Adam, thr6x, say whats—, say hello
Hello
Um, so for this section, I'm gonna explain to him about this thing I just started watching on Netflix called *Chimp Empire*
Um, okay, so basically, it's this show that follows this group of chimps in, in Africa somewhere
And they are like, like a [?], apparently it's like the biggest group of chimpanzees in the world, and they're like kinda civilized, and shit
Like they have, like, a hierarchy of leadership
And, um, there's like one specific chimp, and this is no spoilers, don't worry guys, um
There's a, there's a chimp who's like at the top, named Jackson
And he has another bigger chimp, who's like, is his bodyguard, kind of, named Miles
And, uh, it basically sh—, is the first episode is all I've seen
But it shows like the sort of di-dichotomy between Jackson and Miles and their, their opp, uh, Abrams
And Abrams is like a younger chimp who's tryna become the new alpha
But, Abram, but, um, but, Miles and fuckin', Jackson are like, not letting him, even though Jackson is like a little too old to be an alpha
But because he has a younger, Miles, who's like, he's like the biggest chimp that, uh, I think it's called the Ngogo Chimpanzees, um, ever seen
Like it's the biggest one they've ever had, and, uh, he's like, kind of a fucking huge beast
But, the like, the big sort of drama the first episode is like, they all like, they have drama like, in their, like, in-inside their chimpanzee community
But then all the other neighbouring chimpanzee communities, they have beef with them
So like, there's this one part where they, they
They like slide on the other chimpanzees and they run them out of their territory
But then later in the episode one of the chimpanzees, I don't remember what his name is
He gets jumped by the uh, he is alone and gets jumped and killed by like another group of chimpanzees
And all like Jackson and Abrams and everybody comes together
And they just look so fucking sad like watching this chimp dead
I don't know its really fucking sad but yeah that's
That's chimp empire what is your, are you gonna watch it?
Uh, uhh
Alright that's enough talking about chimps, here's a song off my album its called "the car"

Part XVI: the car - glaive

[Intro]
I was standing in the dark and I'm hoping that you saw me

[Chorus]
Now we're fuckin' in his car, are you ever gonna call him back?
Tell him he's the best you've ever had
I think that I should go, I think that I should go
Now we're fuckin' in his car and you're tellin' me that I'm all that
Callin' me the best you've ever had
I think that I should go, I think that I should go

[Verse 1]
Said you're "finding yourself," if that's what you call it
(Doing Ket' on a Wednesday)
We're both goin' to Hell if we're being honest
He must know there's something happening
Heard you say that, "He just won't get it"
I won't assume, I've got an inhibition
He must know there's something happening
He must know there's something happening

[Pre-Chorus]
I was standing in the dark and thank God, nobody saw me

[Chorus]
Now we're fuckin' in his car, are you ever gonna call him back?
Tell him he's the best you've ever had
I think that I should go, I think that I should go
Now we're fuckin' in his car and you're tellin' me that I'm all that
Callin' me the best you've ever had
I think that I should go, I think that I should go

[Verse 2]
And I'd be lyin' to your face if I said I didn't feel for him
He's doin' way more than I did for ya
He must know there's something happening
I bet he doesn't know the half of it
Told me to leave, but I was just going
You put it in motion
He must know there's something happening
I bet he doesn't know the half of it
Oh good God, now you want him back
What the fuck was that? What the fuck is that?
Father always said, Father always said
That you can't miss what you never had

[Pre-Chorus]
I was standing in the dark and I'm hoping that you saw me

[Chorus]
Now we're fuckin' in his car, are you ever gonna call him back?
Tell him he's the best you've ever had
I think that I should go, I think that I should go
Now we're fuckin' in his car and you're tellin' me that I'm all that
Callin' me the best you've ever had
I think that I should go, I think that I should go

Part XVII: Love It If We Made It - The 1975

[Verse 1]
We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it (slowsilver03)
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them
And we can find out the information
Access all the applications
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
Oh, fuck your feelings
Truth is only hearsay
We're just left to decay
Modernity has failed us

[Chorus]
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it

[Verse 2]
And poison me, daddy
I got the Jones right through my bones
Write it on a piece of stone
A beach of drowning three-year olds
Rest in peace Lil Peep

Part XVIII: GODS - Lil Tracy x Lil Peep

[Verse: Lil Tracy & Lil Peep]
I ain't talking religion, baby, but I'm a God
Louboutins on my feet, but I ain't got no job
I got hoes on me, call me Lil Tracy Minaj
Call Lil Tracy up like we finna get to this guap
Skrrt-skrrt down the block, baby, I can't stop
Drivin' fast, gettin' top, watchin' for the cops
Bet your girl know Lil Peep and Lil Tracy, we hot
Bet your girl know Lil Peep and Lil Tracy, we rock
Your mama tell me that I'm pretty, I get that a lot
He be actin' like he real, but it's just a mirage
She asked me if I wanna die, all I said was "Yah"
Yah, all I said was yah
Now she all up on my dick when the music drop
Hit the mall, fill my pockets up and then I shop
And I need a fat stack, I can't fuck with knots
Bitches run around the lobby, sleepin' at the top
Back in the day, me and SKWAB, we would jugg and rob
Now we pull up to the mall, we look and we cop
Now they treat me like a star, I act like I'm not
Wanna give me a massage in my new garage

[Outro: glaive]
People love to say "glaive should go back to making hyperpop" but nobody has ever said "glaive should go back to making fucking angry, fucking rap music

Talk, talk, talk your shit, we get violent

Got your pussy ass scared, your accounts on private
I said "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha bro, I'm dying"
Told her that I love her, wait, fuck I'm lying

And Mama always said "Don't run from sirens"

And you know that you fucked when I pull up smiling
SLOWSILVER03, I'm with the boys, we sliding

[Verse]
Yeah, I got a Glock and it's silenced, suppressed
Yeah, you got a bitch but she's dying depressed (M-m-mommworld)
And, like all your songs suck but you're trying your best
Got a red laser attached, it's aimed at your head
Fuck with this bullshit, yeah, I'm moving cautious
I've always been loud, annoying, obnoxious
I love to argue, does that mean I'm toxic?
All of your music is shit, why you talk it?
SLOWSILVER03, we step in, we poppin'
I know you mad 'cause your music is flopping
It's mad annoying 'cause I'm not one for crossing
Wait, wait, wait, yeah, I might have to pop him

[Chorus]
Talk, talk, talk your shit, we get violent
And like I'm not one for talking, I prefer to move silent
Got your pussy ass scared, your accounts on private
I said "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, bro, I'm dying"
Told her that I love her, wait, fuck I'm lying
And like every move I make is perfect timing
And Mama always said "Don't run from sirens"
We could pop off, red dot on your iris

Part XXI: Everytime We Touch (Verano Edit) - Cascada

[Verse]
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dream
Forgive me, my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you, it's hard to survive

[Chorus]
'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life

They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry)
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

Part XXII: im nothing thats all i am (ovine hall mix) - mental hospital

[Chorus]
As you walked away from me, I counted every stride
Goddamn it, this happens every time

[Verse 1]
I never hoped for the best
But I'd be surprised if it got any worse, I swear
I never told you the truth, I realized
That you never cared at all

[Pre-Chorus]
I woke up this morning
On someone else's mattress
Don't mean to be a bother
But what the fuck just happened?

[Chorus]
And I fell apart in your driveway, like, a thousand times
Past few months, my dear, I've lived a thousand lives
I knew from the start that I, I should've drawn the line
Hot to the touch my dear, I keep getting cauterized

[Verse 2]
I'm letting the blood build up in my mouth
I'm so damn scared of just letting it out
I'm so damn scared of the sound it'll make on the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
I woke up this morning
On someone else's mattress
Don't mean to be a bother
But what the fuck just happened?

[Chorus]
And I fell apart in your driveway, like, a thousand times
Past few months, my dear, I've lived a thousand lives
I knew from the start that I, I should've drawn the line
Hot to the touch my dear, I keep getting cauterized

[Bridge]
17-250 (Fuck me, oh, why did I do that?)

On someone else's mattress
Don't mean to be a bother
But what the fuck just happened?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright next fucking song, bitch

Part XXIV: Jude Law And A Semester Abroad - Brand New

[Verse 1]
Whatever poison's in this bottle
Will leave me broken, sore and stiff
But it's the genie at the bottom who I'm sucking at
He owes me one last wish
So here's a present, to let you know I still exist
I hope the next boy that you kiss has
Something terribly contagious on his lips

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got a plan
(I got a plan)
I'll drink for forty days and forty nights
(I'm not well-prepared)
A sip for every second-hand tick
And every time you fed the line
“You mean so much to me...”
I'm without you

[Chorus]
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say

[Verse 2]
And even if her plane crashes tonight
She'll find some way to disappoint me
By not burning in the wreckage
Or drowning, at the bottom of the sea
"Jess, I still taste you, and thus reserve my right to hate you
And all this empty space that you create
Does nothing for my flawless sense of style."

[Pre-Chorus]
It's 8:45 (It's 8:45)
The weather is getting better by the hour (rains all the time)
I hope it rains there all the time
And if you ever said you miss me then don't say you never lied
I'm without you

[Chorus]
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say
Who would do anything you say

[Bridge]
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
You're never gonna get it
No more songs about you
After this one I am done
You are, you are, you're gone
No more songs about you
After this one I am done
You are, you are, you're gone
No more songs about you
After this one I am done
You are, you are, you're gone
No more songs about you
After this one I am done
You are, you are, you're gone

[Chorus]
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date
Who would do anything you say

Part XXV: Wiley Flow - Stormzy

[Intro: Wiley]
Bruv, I didn't look at it this way before, but as I approach my birthday
All you man are my youngers
You man are my youngers, bruv

[Verse 1]
If you can't do 10K first week then I don't wanna hear no chat about numbers
You man are my youngers
All blacked out like grungers
Tens and twenties and hundreds
Tens and twenties and thousands, uh
I can't never just lowe dem, no
On Mount Everest shoutin', ah
Soon go back to the mountains
Third album
Nigga, I bless the beat with smoke
And my day one bros, they kept me close
Then I sip my Tetley, take a toke
They're tryna get me on the ropes
Ayy, bro got the speshy in his coat
So, please, man, let's just be adults
And don't be flexin' in my boat
Nigga, you can't test me, I'm the G.O.A.T
Rolex collections lookin' dope
I got the Pepsi and the Hulk
And I ain't flexin' on you niggas
Cah I'll still be sexy if I'm broke

[Chorus]
Wait there, and I was made to win like I'm designed to blow
We're doin' major things, but it's a minor though
I used to pay for things, but that was time ago
And now I hit you niggas with the Wiley flow, it's like

[Verse 2]
Bad 'em up, bad 'em up, bad 'em up once
Never could you take me for a dunce
Been on the scene for a hundred months
All I met is bare cunts
Take man for lunch, eediot youts get punched
Pick one boy from your bunch
Tell man jump
Oh, what, you didn't wanna jump? Well
Oh, well, look, now you're slumped
Lil' nigga, I swerve (Lil' nigga, I swerve)
Get out my lane (Get out my lane)
North and East and West are hot but the South's on flames
This year I'ma be a household name
I grew up in a house of pain
I don't do it for the clout or fame
All the real niggas gonna vouch on my name
All the real niggas gonna vouch on my
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 3]
If you ain't got more than five top tens then I don't wanna hear no chat about chartin'
You man are just startin'
Come in like a young Chris Martin
Start swingin' with my arms like Carlton
Start swingin' with my arms like Anthony
All my niggas been charged, don't amp me
Have your missus in her bra and panty
If you see me in the dance, I'm anti, quite frankly
Heavyweight champion of the world
They wanna war me for my belt
If you ever hear Stormzy caught an L
Know I stood tall before I fell
There's a couple birthdays comin' up
So I took like a quarter from the shelf
Spent like a hundred on my mum
Then about one-forty on myself
The Mille, I sport it like Pharrell
But I got the Nautilus as well
All of the stories that I've lived, my nigga
These are the the stories that I tell

[Chorus]
Wait there, and I was made to win like I'm designed to blow
We're doin' major things, but it's a minor though
I used to pay for things, but that was time ago
And now I hit you niggas with the Wiley flow, it's like

[Refrain]
Run up on them man laughing, fuck it
You got a chain but you tuck it, fuck it
Man throw dirt on my name, blud, fuck it
Slew anybody in the family, fuck it
Run up on them man laughing, fuck it
You got a chain but you tuck it, fuck it
Man throw dirt on my name, blud, fuck it
Slew anybody in the family, iyt, iyt

[Verse 4]
Last three tunes kinda prove that I did this
Mind what you say, I put a yout on my shit list
Must be the same old yout in the dinner hall
Primary, sippin' on my juice with my biscuits
I'm from a place where we move to da witness
Stare in your face, tell 'em, "Business is business"
Came for the fame, but she stayed for the litness
Ask your new girl, she loves Mr. Skeng
You'll never ever see me with guys known for verbals
My bruddas pull up and sky, no rehearsals
Don't switch sides, there's no role reversals
How's the best spitter in grime so commercial? Wait
Nobody said you're good, dun your chat
Your girl take the wood, lumberjack
Hit 'em with a lighter flex, humble brag
I can't drop the bag, I'm the bag

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
If you ain't got no platinum plaques then I don't wanna hear no chat about

Part XXVI: 80mph - quinn

[Chorus]
I'm makin' plays
You know what we gon' do today
Cop a whip and head to space
Ain' no fuckin' hidin' from a drac'
Only opps I hide from is the Jakes
I got hella options, but I'll wait
She hit my line, don't wanna see me anyway
I'ma have to hop up in the spaceship
(Looks like your ultimate spiel might be done after all)

[Verse]
I love this bitch but she my one hater
She wanna leave, I can't say nothin'
Ain't a single thing up for discussion
(Couldn't find the right diet for you, huh?)
Life size Glock and it's bussin'
Pack of Coke, got the white kids jumpin'
In the Camry, big toon stompin'
Hide your face
If you like, it's 'cause I know your name
Name on the block, claim the fame
Separate the real from the fakes
Posted at a rave doin' K
RIP jd, it's not the same
Nigga wanna beef, don't know your name
I'ma keep it goin' anyway

[Chorus]
I'm makin' plays
You know what we gon' do today
Cop a whip and head to space
Ain' no fuckin' hidin' from a drac'
Only opps I hide from is the Jakes

She hit my line, don't wanna see me anyway
I'ma have to hop up in the spaceship

[Verse 1]
Just a girl online and I won't lie
I think I fell in love again
When you're finally mine
I'll try and try to tell myself you're just a friend
When you promised that our love wouldn't die
Did you keep in mind that all good things come to an end?
And I don't mean to pry, but please tell me why
Why you treat me like this, like I don't mind it?
You treat me like shit, want me to hide this
But I can't do that, but I can't do that
But I can't do that, but I can't do that again
But I can't do that, but I can't do that
But I can't do that (glaive)

When I'm with you I miss you

Two pills, two pills in my bedroom
Fuck this, fuck that, I'll be dead soon
New crib in a bit, it got headroom
No friends, no stress, cause they're dead to you
Two pills, two pills in my bedroom
Fuck this, fuck that, I'll be dead soon
New crib in a bit, it got headroom
No friends, no stress, cause they're dead to you

[Intro]
And I hate to see you cry, but I promise it's alright
And I know baby, that sometimes
You gotta feel the lows to feel the highs

[Verse 1]
I woke up drunk in a bathroom stall
Got twenty missed calls straight from my mom, so she's okay
Drunk in a bathroom stall
And I pray to God that she's holding on and she's okay
And I know we've got problems
But everybody does
And I know how we could solve them
But I've been fucking up because

[Chorus]
I hate to see you cry, but I promise it's alright
And I know baby, that sometimes
You gotta feel the lows to feel the highs
And I hate to tell you lies, when I look into your eyes
And I know baby, you hate me, fucking up my life, like, every time

[Verse 2]
My eyes roll back into my head
I walk into her room and smell the cigarettes
And she been drinking all day, smell it on her breath
Wish that I could go back on what I said to you
But I can't do that anymore
'Cause I spent all day on my bedroom floor
And my mom always says "When it rains, it pours"
And I'm tired of this, so I'm shutting the door

[Chorus]
I hate to see you cry, but I promise it's alright
And I know baby, that sometimes
You gotta feel the lows to feel the highs
And I hate to tell you lies, when I look into your eyes
And I know baby, you hate me, fucking up my life, like, every timeEmbed Take My Breath Away - Love Theme from "Top Gun" Top Gun - Motion Picture Soundtrack (Special Expanded Edition) Berlin synth-pop
