Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

[Verse 2]
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all, I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

[Chorus]
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

[Verse 3]
You called me strong, you called me weak
But still, your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me, then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground
You might also like[Chorus]
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there, holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite, yeah
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite
