Thrill is gone away
Thrill is gone, baby

Thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong, baby
You'll be sorry
Someday

Thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away from me
Thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although I'll still live on, baby
But so lonely
I'll be

Thrill is gone
Thrill is gone away for good
Oh, the thrill has gone, baby
Gone away for good

Someday I know I'll be open armed, baby
Just like I know
I know I should
You might also likeI'm free now, baby
I'm free from your spell
Free, free, free now, baby
Baby, I'm free from your spell
Now that it's all over
All I can do
Is wish you well

Thrill is gone
Gone away for good
The thrill has gone, baby
The thrill is gone away for good
Oh you've done me wrong baby
You'll be sorry someday
Thrill is gone
Free from your spell
I'm freeEmbed The Thrill Is Gone Deuces Wild B.B. King;Tracy Chapman blues
