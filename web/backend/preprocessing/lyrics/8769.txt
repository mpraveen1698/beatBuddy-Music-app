So long to all my friends
Every one of them met tragic ends
With every passing day
I'd be lying if I didn't say that I miss them all tonight
And if they only knew what I would say

[Chorus: Gerard Way]
If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep
Never let them take the light behind your eyes
One day, I'll lose this fight
As we fade in the dark, just remember you will always burn as bright

[Verse 2: Gerard Way]
Be strong and hold my hand
Time, it comes for us, you'll understand
We'll say goodbye today, and I'm sorry how it ends this way
If you promise not to cry
Then I'll tell you just what I would say

[Chorus: Gerard Way]
If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep
Never let them take the light behind your eyes
I'll fail and lose this fight
Never fade in the dark, just remember you will always burn as bright

When I'm here no longer
You must be stronger, and

If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep
Never let them take the light behind your eyes
I failed and lost this fight
Never fade in the dark, just remember you will always burn as bright
