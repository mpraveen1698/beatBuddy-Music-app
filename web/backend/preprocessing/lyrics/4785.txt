7 ContributorsTalking Stage Lyrics[Intro]
(Mason)
Aye

[Chorus]
Pain in my chest that I can’t explain
Fallin' in love got me feelin' drained
I don't know about love no more
Cah so many times that a man got played
Losin' my mind, tryna find my way
I was losin' time tryna find my bae
Doin' up dates when I shoulda got paid
I was wastin' my time on a talkin' stage

[Verse 1]
I’ve been tryin' to show you that you’re toxic
Why are you blamin' that shit on a star sign?
Me and pain are becomin' the best of friends
I think that it’s love that I can’t find
Trying to trust again, I'm DTB, I been havin' a hard time
Stabbed in the back with a sharp knife
Reminiscin' with pics in the archive
Huh, said you want to leave me in the past
I guess now I know my place
Show you love to the moon and back
Shit, now, you're telling me you're needin' space
Why would you run this race?
More time, you couldn’t even keep the pace
I thought you were real
Now, you’re movin' fake
Still confused why your energy changed
And I clocked you here for the moment
It was a fib when you said it’s for life
Meant to be Bonnie and I was your Clyde
Guess it’s a lie when you said you would ride
And I shoulda put faith in Lizzy
Cah she will never waste your time
But I was still out simpin'
Doing the most just to make you mine
You might also like[Chorus]
Pain in my chest that I can’t explain
Fallin' in love got me feelin' drained
I don't know about love no more
Cah so many times that a man got played
Losin' my mind, tryna find my way
I was losin' time tryna find my bae
Doin' up dates when I shoulda got paid
I was wastin' my time on a talkin' stage

[Verse 2]
I can’t fuck with a girl cah these females fake
Showin' them love, but they feel no way
I can’t find no love up in LDN
I've been feelin' to relocate
Lately, I've been gainin' fame
Can’t take no bitch to the place I stay
Feels like my heart's been locked in a cage
Cah I can’t open up about pain
I can't, only talk about the way I feel when I'm writin' bars
I try keep it real, at the end of the day, I was left with internal scars
Could've been Alone With You like Arz
But you've chosen to move in fast
Why the hell did I let you in?
I don’t know where I left my guard
[Pre-Chorus]
It’s 4AM, I ain’t had no sleep
Cah the thoughts in my head too deep
Man, I need more rest
Seven days on my grind got me feelin' weak
And this life that we live done come with the cost
Just know that the price ain’t cheap
They don’t look your way when you ain’t got bread
That’s why I scream DTB

[Chorus]
Pain in my chest that I can’t explain
Fallin' in love got me feelin' drained
I don't know about love no more
Cah so many times that a man got played
Losin' my mind, tryna find my way
I was losin' time tryna find my bae
Doin' up dates when I shoulda got paid
I was wastin' my time on a talkin' stage
Pain in my chest that I can’t explain
Fallin' in love got me feelin' drained
I don't know about love no more
Cah so many times that a man got played
Losin' my mind, tryna find my way
I was losin' time tryna find my bae
Doin' up dates when I shoulda got paid
I was wastin' my time on a talkin' stage

It’s 4AM, I ain’t had no sleep
Cah the thoughts in my head too deep
Huh, man, I need more rest
Seven days on my grind got me feelin' weak
And this life that we live done come with the cost
Just know that the price ain’t cheap
They don’t look your way when you ain’t got bread
That’s why I scream DTB
