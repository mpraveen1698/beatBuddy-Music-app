6 ContributorsGood Luck Lyrics[Intro]
J-J-J-J-James Hype
Good luck, good luck finding someone like me

[Verse 1]
Stop, you're not listening
You haven't heard a single word
I know you've been missing me
But when you left, you left me hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
Shut up and don't talk, I won't be taking your call
It's clear that you're not over me, yeah
I deleted you from my phone 'cause I'm happier on my own
Good luck trying to find somebody

[Chorus]
You can sail around the world and cross the seven seas
But you ain't never gonna find someone like me
I'm better off without you now, but honestly
Good luck, good luck finding someone like me

[Post-Chorus]
Good luck, good luck f— someone—
Good luck, good luck finding some—
Good luck, good luck finding someone like me
Good luck, good luck f— someone—
Good luck, good luck finding—
Good luck, good luck finding someone like me

Stop reminiscing
What's done is done, no going back
And the clock's start ticking
It was you who left and that's a fact, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Shut up and don't talk, I won't be taking your call
It's clear that you're not over me, yeah
I deleted you from my phone 'cause I'm happier on my own
Good luck tryna find somebody

[Chorus]
You can sail around the world and cross the seven seas
But you ain't never gonna find someone like me (No, baby)
I'm better off without you now, but honestly
Good luck, good luck finding someone like me

[Post-Chorus]
Good luck, good luck f— someone—
Good luck, good luck finding some—
Good luck, good luck finding someone like me
Good luck, good luck f— someone— (Good luck)
Good luck, good luck finding—
Good luck, good luck finding someone like me (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus]
You can sail around the world and cross the seven seas
But you ain't never gonna find someone like me
I'm better off without you now, but honestly
Good luck, good luck finding someone like meEmbed Good Luck Good Luck James Hype;Pia Mia deep-house
