Maybe I'm a dreamer
Maybe I'm a fool for you
But I think I'm a believer
I believe in something new
Maybe I'm a liar
But maybe I would tell the truth
I think we gotta hold on
And I hope it's not too late for us to change

[Chorus: Leony]
Will I see your face
Somewhere in a better place?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2: Leony]
Maybe I'm a dreamer
Maybe I'm a fool for you
But I think I'm a believer
I believe in something new
Maybe I'm a liar
But maybe I would tell thе truth
I think we gotta hold on
And I hope it's not too late for us to changе
You might also like[Chorus: Leony]
Will I see your face
Somewhere in a better place?
