16 ContributorsU Are My High Lyrics[Intro: Future]
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (Pluto, Hendrixx)
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (DJ Snake)
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you

[Chorus]
You, you are my high
Do you hear me, love?
You, you are my high
Do you hear me, love?

[Verse: Future]
I needed space, baby
Go out to space, baby (High)
I'ma need space, baby
I'm goin' out to space, baby (Baby)
I need you arrogant, I need you confident, I need you to promise this, babe
I've been searchin' for the right one
Introducе you to Jimmy Choos shoes
Happy belated, yеah
Check the commodity, hottest commodity
Biggest whoever, whenever
She the baddest in the city
Know what comin' with it
Stackin' the liberty, tall as the Statue of Liberty
Hand you the Benz key, hand you the Lamborghini
You elevated, physically, spiritually
I'm tryna love you, tryna boost your confidence
I'm tryna spoil you, girl
I put the big rocks on the seven figure
Bubble bath in the tub, I see you, I see you

[Bridge]
The way you walk, oh, oh, oh
'Cause baby, baby
It's been a long time
Long time, long time
Woah, woah-woah, oh, oh
It's been a long time
Long time, long time
Woah, woah-woah, oh, oh
[Outro: Future]
All these girls in the club, all I see is you, all I see is you (You, high)
All these girls in the club, I see you, I see you (Do you hear me, love?)
All these girls in the club, all I see is you, all I see is you (You, high)
All these girls in the club, I see you, I see you (Do you hear me, love?)
Sprung out on these baddies and money (You, high)
Sprung out on bad bitches and money (Do you hear me, love?)
Sprung out on bad bitches and money, money (You, high)
Sprung out on bad bitches and money (Do you hear me?)1Embed U Are My High U Are My High DJ Snake electronic
