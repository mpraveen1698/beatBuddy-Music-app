8 ContributorsDarker Still Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I’m buying acres in the sky
And building stairs with every lie
With every step I make her cry
Until I die, until I die

[Verse 2]
I’m swinging hard for all my life
Reaching across this great divide
Until I see the other side
Until I die, until I die

[Chorus]
And the night grows darker still
And the night grows darker still
And the night grows dark, darker still

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I’m swimming deep into her eyes
I’m swimming strong, but won’t survive
The dark, the blue, I cannot fight
Until I die, until I die

I’m wishing hard upon the night
With every wish, a new star dies
But bright, the light behind her eyes
Until I die, until I die

[Chorus]
And the night grows darker still
And the night grows darker still
And the night grows dark

[Instrumental Break]
Darker still!

[Bridge]
Until I die, until I die!
(And the night grows darker still)
Until I die, until I die!
(And the night grows darker still)
Until I die, until I die! (Ohhhhhh)
(And the night grows darker still)
(And the night grows dark)

[Outro]
And the night grows darker still
And the night grows darker still
And the night grows darkEmbed Darker Still Darker Still Parkway Drive metalcore
