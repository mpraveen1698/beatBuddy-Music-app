Alabama, Arkansas, I do love my Ma and Pa
Not the way that I do love you
Well, holy moly, me oh my, you're the apple of my eye
Girl, I never loved one like you
Man, oh, man, you're my best friend, I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothing that I need
Well, hot and heavy pumpkin pie
Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
There ain't nothing please me more than you

[Chorus: Jade Castrinos & Alexander]
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is whenever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is whenever I'm with you

[Post-Chorus: Jade Castrinos & Alexander]
La-la-la-la, take me home
Honey (Mother), I'm coming home

[Verse 2: Jade Castrinos, Alexander & Both]
I'll follow you into the park
Through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I never loved one like you
Moats and boats and waterfalls, alleyways and pay phone calls
I been everywhere with you (Hey, that's true)
Laugh until we think we'll die, barefoot on a summer night
Never could be sweeter than with you
And in the streets, you run a-free, like it's only you and me
Geez, you're something to see
You might also like[Chorus: Jade Castrinos & Alexander]
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is whenever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

[Post-Chorus: Jade Castrinos & Alexander]
La-la-la-la, take me home
Daddy, I'm coming home

[Bridge Spoken: Jade Castrinos & Alexander]
Jade? Alexander?
Do you remember that day you fell outta my window?
I sure do, you came jumping out after me!
Well, you fell on the concrete and nearly broke your ass
And you were bleeding all over the place
And I rushed you out to the hospital, you remember that?
Yes, I do
Well there's something I never told you about that night
What didn't you tell me?
While you were sitting in the back seat
Smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last
I was falling deep, deeply in love with you
And I never told you 'til just now!
Aww!
[Chorus: Jade Castrinos & Alexander]
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is whenever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is where I'm alone with you

[Outro: Jade Castrinos & Alexander]
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh, home, yes, I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you

[Outro: Jade Castrinos, Alexander & Jade Castrinos & Alexander]
Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my Ma and Pa
Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alleyways and payphone calls
(Oh, home) Home
(Oh, home) Home
Home is wherever I'm with you
(Oh, home) Home
(Oh, home) Home
Home is when I'm alone with you53Embed Home Up From Below Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros folk
