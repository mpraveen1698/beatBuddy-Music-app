5 ContributorsGold Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shut the door to the spaceship
Operation, "Get Back to the Basics"
Goddamn, she don't know what she means to me
Hotdamn, she don't know what it seems to be, yeah
This done got a little crazy
Life been looking like a classic, Issa Rae scene
Goddamn, I don't know what this means for me (Uh)
But I can say what it seems to be, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Has it returned at last, my light, my fire?
Let's enjoy ourselves, inspired
Gave me something I had to earn
Gotta save that, save that gold

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Gold, gold, gold, gold (Oh, oh-oh)
(Gotta save that, save that) Gold (Hey, hey, hey)
Gold, gold, gold, gold (Oh, oh-oh)
(Gotta save that, save that) Gold

[Verse 2]
They say I got the Midas touch
Tonight I'll be providing such
On that golden body, oh yeah
You look good to me
Put that pussy right there where my grill should be
You shine more than a diamond does
And them carats looking bright as fuck
Girl, you know you got it (Oh yeah)
That's a queen to me
Put a crown right there for the world to see, oh yeah

Has it returned at last, my light, my fire?
Let's enjoy ourselves, inspired
Gave me something I had to earn
Gotta save that, save that gold

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
