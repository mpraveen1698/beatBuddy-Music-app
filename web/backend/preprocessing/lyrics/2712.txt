15 Contributors(I Canâ€™t Help) Falling in Love with You Lyrics[Intro]
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you

[Verse 1]
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you

[Verse 2]
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
I can't help
Falling in love with you

[Chorus]
As a river flows
Gently to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things were meant to be

[Verse 3]
Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
But I can't help
Falling in love with you

Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things were meant to be

[Verse 4]
Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
I can't help
Falling in love with you

[Outro]
I can't help falling in love with you
I can't help falling in love with you
I can't help falling in love with you5Embed (I Can't Help) Falling In Love With You Promises And Lies UB40 reggae
