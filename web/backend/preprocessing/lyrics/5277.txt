8 ContributorsPassenger Seat Lyrics[Verse 1]
I look at her and have to smile
As we go driving for a while
Her hair blowing in the open window of my car
And as we go I see lights
I watch them glimmer in her eyes
In the darkness of the evening

[Chorus]
And I've got all that I need
Right here in the passenger seat
Oh and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Just knowing that she's inches from to me

[Verse 2]
We stop to get something to drink
My mind clouds and I can't think
Scared to death to say I love her
Oh and then the moon peeks from the clouds
I hear my heart it beats so loud
Tried to tell her simply

[Chorus]
That I've got all that I need
Right here in the passenger seat
And I can't keep my eyes on the road
Knowing that she's inches from to me
And I've got all that I need
Right here in the passenger seat
Oh and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Knowing that she's inches from to me

Oh and I know
That this love grow

[Bridge]
And I've got all that I need
Right here in the passenger seat
Oh and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Just knowing that she's inches from to me

[Chorus]
And I've got all that I need
I look at her and have to smile
Right here in the passenger seat
As we go driving for a while
Her hair blowing in the open window of my car
Oh and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Knowing that she's inches from me
And as we go the traffic lights
I watch them glimmer in her eyes
In the darkness of the evening

[Outro]
And I've got all that I need
I look at her and have to smile
Right here in the passenger seat
As we go driving for a while1Embed Passenger Seat Passenger Seat Stephen Speaks acoustic
