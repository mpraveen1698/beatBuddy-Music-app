[Intro]
Mm, mm

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I can't see where you comin' from
But I know just what you runnin' from
And what matters ain't the "Who's baddest," but the
Ones who stop you fallin' from your ladder, when you're

[Verse 2]
Feelin' like you're feelin' now
And doin' things just to please your crowd
When I love you like the way I love you
And I suffer but I ain't gonna cut you 'cause

[Chorus]
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home

And your mother, givin' up on askin' why

But I know just what you're runnin' from
And what matters ain't the "Who's baddest," but the
Ones who stop you fallin' from your ladder, 'cause

[Chorus]
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
