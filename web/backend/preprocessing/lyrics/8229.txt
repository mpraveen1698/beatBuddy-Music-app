Growing up my father told me
"Son, you know that boys don't cry"
Bottled up emotion, always try to keep that shit inside
Now I don't know how to feel 'em

[Verse 2: Gavin Haley]
College when I met you
Never seen someone so beautiful
Told me that you love me
But you need somebody vulnerable
But I don't know how

[Chorus: Gavin Haley with Ella Vos]
I'm sorry for the way that I am
Got problems that I don't understand
Everytime you ask me, "Baby, you alright?"
Then I stop like a deer in the headlights
Thinking that you'll just get mad
I'm sorry for the way that I am
Got issues that I don't understand
So everrytime you ask me, "Baby you alright?"
Then I stop like a deer in the headlights
I'm scared to love you like that
So sorry for the way I am
The way I am, the way I am
So sorry for the way I am

Don't expect you to stay
After all these things I do
Wish I could take your hand
Promise that I'll pull us through
But it's all undone

[Verse 4: Ella Vos]
No I can't take it back
All the things I said before
Moments come, watch them go
Wish I said, "I love you" more
'Cause it's not enough

[Chorus: Gavin Haley & Ella Vos]
I'm sorry for the way that I am
Got problems that I don't understand
Everytime you ask me, "baby you alright?"
Then I stop like a deer in the headlights
Thinking that you'll just get mad
I'm sorry for the way that I am
Got issues that I don't understand
So everytime you ask me, "Baby you alright?"
Then I stop like a deer in the headlights
I'm scared to love you like that
So sorry for the way I am
The way I am, the way I am
So sorry for the way I amEmbed The Way I Am Long Game Gavin Haley;Ella Vos chill
