11 ContributorsLove Changes (Everything) LyricsI was only seventeen when she looked at me that way
Seems like yesterday
I was only fooling round but she stole my heart away
I've never been the same

I felt the strangest feeling
Like a raging fire it burned
She left, I cried for weeks
And I can't forget her or the lesson that I learned

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings, oho

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Love changes everything

Then the years went rolling by, I grew up and moved away
Had to earn my pay
Found another lover then but my heart is sad to say
It only ended up the same way

And I wondered: was I destined to spend my life alone?
Oh, girl, you answered my question
This time it's working, you've given me new hope
You might also likeLove changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Love changes everything

I've seen the way love shakes you, makes you, breaks you
It's got a power of its own

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings
Don't forget it, girl

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Don't you forget it, baby
Love changes everything

(Love makes you fly) Flying away, oho
(Love changes) Let's make love
(Love changes everything) Oh

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings
Don't forget it, girl (Love changes)
Don't you forget it, baby
