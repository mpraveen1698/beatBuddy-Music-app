6 ContributorsMoney Run Low Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tongue tied
Dreams die
We all lose our way
We have fears
Shed tears
And we carry our mistakes
It's funny when you're down and out they don't come around
They don't come around, oh
It's funny when you're down and out they don't make a sound

[Chorus]
I've been working my hands down to the bones
Where you gonna be when the money run low?
Lovers and friends
Come and they go
Where you gonna be when the money, the money run low?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Where you gonna be when the money run low?

[Verse 2]
I've been high
The good life
It's good until it fades
But when you come down
The cold ground's gonna put you in your place
Gotta count my blessings
Try to pay it forward
Somehow always end up going back
Always learning everything the hard way
You might also like[Chorus]
I've been working my hands down to the bones
Where you gonna be when the money run low?
Lovers and friends
Come and they go
Where you gonna be when the money, the money run low?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Where you gonna be when the money, the money run low?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Where you gonna be when the money, the money run low?

[Bridge]
The money run low
The money run low
The money run low, oh, oh, oh yeah
The money run low
The money run low
The money run low, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I've been working my hands down to the bones
Where you gonna be when the money run low?
Lovers and friends
Come and they go
Where you gonna be when the money run low?
[Chorus]
I've been working my hands down to the bones
Where you gonna be when the money run low?
Lovers and friends
Come and they go
Where you gonna be when the money, the money run low?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Where you gonna be when the money, the money run low?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Where you gonna be when the money run low?Embed Money Run Low ATLAS (Deluxe) The Score alt-rock
