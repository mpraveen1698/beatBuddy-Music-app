(We got London on da track)

[Chorus]
Girl, let your guard down, girl, don't put on or front
If you really want it, baby, you know what I want
Me want to get nasty inna di car, that's the afterparty
I wan' feel you badly on my body, but I can't anymore

Runnin' 'round (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Comin' in (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Comin' out (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We tryna come (Tryna come) to our senses
But we keep pouring up this senseless
Got my body on point, so I knit-pick
Gotta be good paid with the whip, whip

I'm like, "If you really want it, baby, you know what I want"
