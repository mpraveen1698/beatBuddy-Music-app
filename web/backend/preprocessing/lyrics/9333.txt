Stay strong, carry on
What you want isn't far away
If you were so sure that we're not working out
You don't have to stay
You say you want more, what's it for?
Set the score every time you play
'Cause if you can't see how much you mean to me
What else can I say?
Why can't you wait?
Why can't you wait?

[Verse 2: Drew Taggart]
Stay strong, carry on
You should know that I'm here to stay
And if you need more, what's it for?
Tell me what price I gotta pay

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Howie with Drew Taggart]
Why can't you wait? This isn't temporary
Wait, I need you more than you think
Wait, I'm only asking you to stay

[Chorus: Tom Howie & Drew Taggart]
Why can't you wait for me to call just to hear you say
I'm all that you want and you wanna stay?
Why would you hang on for so long just to walk away?
Why can't you wait? Why can't you wait?
Why can't you wait for me to know who I wanna be?
You're the one I want when I'm running free
I know that someday we could say we were meant to be
Why can't you wait? Why can't you wait?
Why can't you wait?
Why can't you wait?

Therе's so much more in store
For us both, on the othеr side
One day we can say
That we left all of this behind

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Howie with Drew Taggart]
Why can't you wait? This isn't temporary
Wait, I need you more than you think
Wait, I'm only asking you to stay

[Chorus: Tom Howie & Drew Taggart]
Why can't you wait for me to call just to hear you say
I'm all that you want and you wanna stay?
Why would you hang on for so long just to walk away?
Why can't you wait? Why can't you wait?
Why can't you wait for me to know who I wanna be?
You're the one I want when I'm running free
I know that someday we could say we were meant to be
Why can't you wait? Why can't you wait?
Why can't you wait?
