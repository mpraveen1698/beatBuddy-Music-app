I wanna share my dreams
Wanna share with you
On the wings of love, like dreamers do
Touch your heart
You're the queen of broken hearts
Oh, we are daytime friends and nighttime fools
Wanna play this game
You break the rules
Tears of love are frozen tears

[Refrain]
Geronimo's Cadillac is making all girls too mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh, it's a drag
Geronimo's Cadillac are making all girls too sad
Geronimo has a heart, oh, it's a drag

[Chorus]
Geronimo's Cadillac
It's tossing, oh, in your head
It's tossing and turning
It's burning, It makes you mad
Geronimo's Cadillac oh, baby I'll hold you back
It's tossing and turning
It's burning, It makes you sad

I'm looking through the eyes, the eyes of love
Made a fool of me, can't get enough
Touch my heart
Boulevard of broken dreams
Another time for love, other place to be
Don't let him take your love, your love from me
Tears of love are frozen tears

[Refrain]
Geronimo's Cadillac is making all girls too mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh, it's a drag
Geronimo's Cadillac are making all girls too sad
Geronimo has a heart, oh, it's a drag

[Chorus]
Geronimo's Cadillac
It's tossing, oh, in your head
It's tossing and turning
It's burning, It makes you mad
Geronimo's Cadillac oh, baby I'll hold you back
It's tossing and turning
It's burning, It makes you sad

[Outro]
Geronimo's Cadillac is making all girls too mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh, it's a drag2Embed Geronimo's Cadillac In The Middle Of Nowhere Modern Talking synth-pop
