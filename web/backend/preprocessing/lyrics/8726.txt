She don't call
But I know I wanna take you, leave you alone, ayy
Hmm, hello?

[Verse 1]
I don't really know where I'm tryna go
But I know I wanna take you (Yeah)
When I'm on the road and I leave you alone
I just pray I don't break you (Yeah)
I was on the phone waitin' in the other room
Not trying to wake you (Yeah)
When I'm on my own, I'll be sipping Patrón
And I'll be trying to blame you (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Now you calling me crazy
Girl, I know (Girl, I know)
When you tell me you hate me (Yeah)
I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
Now you calling me crazy (Ayy)
Girl, I know (Girl, I know)
When you tell me you hate me (Ayy)
I know that you don't (I know that you don't)

[Verse 2]
I would give it all back for you right now
I can never forget you
Run away from me, try to run away
But I ain't gonna let you
And I can hear my heartbeat, somethin' like the bass drum
Said, baby, don't stall with the fucking and the make-ups, nah
I'ma take the long way home
Got a couple hundred missed calls in my phone
You might also like[Chorus]
Now you calling me crazy
Girl, I know (Girl, I know)
When you tell me you hate me (Yeah)
I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
Now you calling me crazy (Ayy)
Girl, I know (Girl, I know)
When you tell me you hate me (Ayy)
I know that you don't (I know that you don't)

[Bridge]
But when you tell me that you love me
I put trust in you, don't judge me
I'm just going through some shit right now
And I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down
No, I just wanna leave this town
Sometimes I feel like everyone hates me

[Chorus]
Now you calling me crazy
Girl, I know (Girl, I know)
When you tell me you hate me (Yeah)
I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
Now you calling me crazy (Ayy)
Girl, I know (Girl, I know)
When you tell me you hate me (Ayy)
