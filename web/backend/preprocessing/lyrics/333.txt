[Verse 1]
Spend some time away
Getting ready for the day you're born again
Spend some time alone
Understand that soon you'll run with better men
Alone again

[Chorus]
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

[Verse 2]
No use looking out
It's within that brings that lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You'll be clear among the better men
Alone again

[Chorus]
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
AloneYou might also like110Embed Chamber Of Reflection Salad Days Mac DeMarco indie
