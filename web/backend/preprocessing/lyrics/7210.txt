13 ContributorsOh Honey Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I get lost, feel I've been crossed
She will be my salvation
When I feel low, I know where to go
She'll be my inspiration

Yeah, when my poor heart is breakin' apart
She'll put it back together
She ain't the kind to show off her mind
But talkin' of love, she's clever, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, honey (Oh, honey)
Oh, honey (Oh, honey)

[Verse 2]
She rarely spends time with her friends
Tells me she's blue without me
When things go wrong, her faith is strong
I know she'll never doubt me

Yeah, when she arrives and stands by my side
Makes me so proud to know her
High-steppin' dames with high-soundin' names
There ain't nothin' they could show her, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, honey (My honey)
Oh, honey (Honey, honey)

[Bridge]
Now I just wanna thank you, baby
For givin' me a brand new start
I was goin' down, you saved me
When you let me in your lovin' heart, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, honey (Talkin' 'bout you, honey)
Oh, honey (Honey, yeah)

Oh, honey (Beautiful honey)
Oh, honey (You make me feel so proud, so proud, baby)

Oh, honey (My, my, my baby, yeah)
Oh, honey (I love you, baby)2Embed Oh Honey Oh Honey Delegation disco
