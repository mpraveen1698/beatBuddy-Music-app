Danger them is, while some call them Major Lazer

[Verse 1: Nyla]
Stand up like a soldier, baby
Yeah, I know you're built like that
Gun it like a holster, baby
Show dem seh you're wicked like that
We live where the war is raging
Chasing our crazy dreams
Hoping that the bridge won't cave in
Tonight we let it all go free

[Pre-Chorus: Nyla]
Gimme di ting and mek me rock inna di dance
Gimme di ting and mek me rock inna di dance
Mash it up, hot step inna di dance
Gimme di ting and mek me rock, rock, rock, rock
Gimme di ting and mek me rock inna di dance
Gimme di ting and mek me rock inna di dance
Mash it up, hot step inna di dance
Gimme di ting and mek me

[Chorus: Nyla]

Show them you're flame to the fire

But until that day I'ma rise up high
I put my light in the air
I wanna see everywhere
