40 ContributorsStay the Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know that we are upside down
So hold your tongue and hear me out
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind
You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Are you gonna stay the night?

[Chorus]
Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So, oh, oh, oh
Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So, oh, oh, oh
Are you gonna stay the night?

I am a fire, you're gasoline
Come pour yourself all over me
We'll let this place go down in flames
Only one more time
You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Are you gonna stay the night?

[Chorus]
Are you gonna stay the night? (When we get burned)
Doesn't mean we're bound for life (We never learn)
So, oh, oh, oh
Are you gonna stay the night?

[Bridge]
Night, night, night, night, night, night
Night, night, night, night, night, night
Night, night, night, night, night, night
Are you gonna stay the night?
[Chorus]
Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So, oh, oh, oh
Are you gonna stay the night?

[Outro]
Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Are you gonna stay the night?67Embed Stay The Night - Featuring Hayley Williams Of Paramore Clarity (Deluxe) Zedd;Hayley Williams german
