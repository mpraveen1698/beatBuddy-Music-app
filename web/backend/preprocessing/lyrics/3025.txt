So, it’s probably nothing
But it’s been on my mind some time and I can’t let it go
I know, there’s gotta be something
That I could say in time, but I can’t find the words

[Chorus]
Keep me, keep me on fire
Keep me, keep me on fire

[Verse 2]
A dose, a moment to live in
And I’m hoping it stays a while in the space you were in
And I froze, and I reckon I missed it
When all of the rain came down in the shape of everything

[Chorus]
So keep me, keep me on fire
Keep me, keep me on fire
Keep me honest, keep me kind
Keep me as your finish line
Keep me, keep me on fireSee Novo Amor LiveGet tickets as low as $43You might also like1Embed Keep Me Cannot Be, Whatsoever Novo Amor folk
