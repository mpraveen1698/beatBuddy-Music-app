1 ContributorMe Without You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Looking through
All the photographs of me and you
I keep staring at my phone
Not trying to look alone
But I probably do

Went to our favorite place
I ordered take out for the third straight day
I'll just eat it on the bus
'Cause at home I picture us
And you're all that I can taste

[Chorus]
Me without you
Is like driving, without the headlights
Me without you
Is like waking up without the sunrise
Never thought that I could feel the way I do
But I'm just not me, without you

[Verse 2]
Pacing the living room
That record's spinning, now my head is too
I play our favorites all night long
But alone it feels so wrong
And it all sounds out of tune
You might also like[Chorus]
Me without you
Is like driving, without the headlights
Me without you
Is like waking up without the sunrise
Never thought that I could feel the way I do
But I'm just not me, without you

[Verse 3]
I close my eyes
And you're still in my arms
Feeling like, we're right back at the start
Should've held on to it tighter than I did
'Cause me without you feels like (me without you feels like)

[Bridge]
Me without you
Is like driving, without the headlights
Me without you
Is like waking up without the sunrise

Never thought that I could feel the way I do
But I'm just not me without you

[Chorus]
Me without you
Is like driving, without the headlights
Me without you
Is like waking up without the sunrise
Never thought that I could feel the way I do
[Post-Chorus]
But I'm just not me, without youEmbed Me Without You Me Without You Havelin folk
