We do the same drugs
Turn up the sounds and let it fill your body
Building up the tension, I'll stay the night
If you're having fun, I can feel your body

[Chorus]
You're gonna wish you left, but you never leave
'Cause you can't put your arms 'round a memory
You're gonna wish you left, but you never leave
(Never leave, never leave, leave, leave, leave, leave)
You're gonna wish you left, but you nevеr leave
'Cause you can't put your arms 'round a mеmory
You're gonna wish you left, but you never leave
(Never leave, never leave, leave, leave, leave, leave)

[Drop]
You just want emotion
You just want

[Verse 2]
It's the same love
I left the ground and I can't feel my body
Lost in your dimension, I'll stay awhile
But it's not enough if I can't feel your body (Feel your body)

You're gonna wish you left, but you never leave
'Cause you can't put your arms 'round a memory
You're gonna wish you left, but you never leave
(Never leave, never leave, leave, leave, leave, leave)
You're gonna wish you left, but you never leave
'Cause you can't put your arms 'round a memory
You're gonna wish you left, but you never leave
(Never leave, never leave, leave, leave, leave, leave)
