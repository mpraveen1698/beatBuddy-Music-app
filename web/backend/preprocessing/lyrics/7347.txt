26 ContributorsRainy Day Lyrics[Intro: Spoken Word]
"Run!"

[Verse 1: Spencer Charnas]
Crawl through the holes in the evidence
Where evil has taken up residence
No faith in what red and white will say
They save the truth for a Rainy Day

[Pre-Chorus: Spenecer Charnas, Spoken Word]
Fall through the cracks with the casualties
Where freedom's thrown out with morality
Become a soldier for the controller
Or battle 'til you beat the game

[Chorus: Spencer Charnas]
Are you listening to the whispering?
Is it sinking in? 'Cause it's sickening
Will you take the bait while you suffocate?
'Causе you know, something is creeping in the dark

[Post-Chorus: Spoken Word]
"Run!"

[Verse 2: Spencer Charnas]
A call to survivors has just come through
"Rеsist the zombie they'll make of you"
Call out the lies, blow the storm away
Don't save the truth for a Rainy Day

Are you listening to the whispering?
Is it sinking in? 'Cause it's sickening
Will you take the bait while you suffocate?
'Cause you know, something is creeping in the dark

[Post-Chorus: Spencer Charnas]
In the dark
(Something is creeping)
The dark
In the dark
(Something is creeping)

[Bridge: Spencer Charnas, Spoken Word]
There is no next level
(S.T.A.R.S)
"All access denied"
(S.T.A.R.S)
Ignorance is past-tense
(S.T.A.R.S)
Game over "You died"

[Breakdown: Spencer Charnas, Spoken Word]
Oh
Become a soldier for the controller
Or battle 'til you beat the game
[Chorus: Spencer Charnas & Joe Occhitui, Spencer Charnas & Ricky Armellino]
Are you listening to the whispering?
Is it sinking in? 'cause it's sickening
Will you take the bait while you suffocate?
'Cause you know, something is creeping in the dark
Are you listening to the whispering?
Is it sinking in 'cause it's sickening?
Will you take the bait while you suffocate?
'Cause you know, something is creeping in the dark

[Post-Chorus: Spencer Charnas]
In the dark
(Something is creeping)
The dark
In the dark

[Outro: Spoken Word, Spencer Charnas]
