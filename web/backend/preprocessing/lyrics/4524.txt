If I showed you my true colors, and you saw who I am
Would you love me with my demons as hard as you can?
It's okay if you hate it (Yeah), I'll understand (Yeah, yeah)
You can find somebody easier (Yeah, yeah), I'll find love where I can (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Lost in my thoughts, I don't know what to do
Alone in my room, thinking of you again
Baby girl, I cannot sit and pretend
Yeah, I do not want to be more than friends
Sleeping at night, and I'm dreaming of you
I've never seen something more beautiful
Baby, you got me all up in a trance
Girl, come walk with me, and please hold my hand

[Bridge: 8ercent & Mishaal]
If I showed you my true colors, and you saw who I am
Would you love me with my demons (I've never seen such a—) as hard as you can?
It's okay if you, okay if you, I'll underst—, I'll underst—
Find somebody, find somebody, I'll find love where I can (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Holding you, kissing while we in the rain
Give me your heart, let me heal all your pain
If I got the chance, I'd give anything
If I got the chance, I'd give anything
All of these feelings, you never would know
'Cause I'm too afraid to go and show
Hold on tight, never let go
Hold on tight, never let go

You can find somebody easier, I'll find love where I can6Embed dream girl dream girl 8percent sad
