2 ContributorsBe Someone Lyrics[Verse 1: Ray]
I see you in the same place
I see you in the rat race
When you getting out of this maze
I see you with the same mates
When you gonna let shit change
When you gonna use that brain
I wanna see the shit made
Before all the lights fade
See I work til my back break
Shovel dirt in the back lane
Oh it hurt with the black pain
What's the price of the small change
I tell them that I'm okay
And I really am okay
But I need to leave this space
If they're gonna say I'm great

[Pre-Chorus: Ray]
Questions I need to be asking I need you hеre right now
Blessings I need to have to figurе it right out
Oh what have I learned
It pays to be there first (Oh oh oh)
I don't wanna

[Chorus: Ray]
I don't wanna see you around
Cause I know you're gonna be someone
Gonna be someone else
And still it hurts to say
Yeah still it hurts to say
I need you, I need you, I need you

I walk alone this earth
Living life in reverse
I walk as it all turns
I watch as the shit burns
Oh what have I learned
It pays to be there first
So I’m waiting for my turn
To reach what we deserve
Oh, no, no, no
I won’t go back there no more
Oh, no, no, no
You’ll see my clothes on the floor
Oh, no, no, no
You’ll see I’m ready for war
Oh, no, no, no
You know what I am here for

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ben]
Take a chance at a plan
I’ll be man made til a made man
Take a chance at a plan
I’ll be man made til a made man
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Questions I have to be asking
I need you here right now
[Chorus: Ray & Ben]
I don’t wanna be around (I don't want to be around x2)
If you don’t want to tell me something
I don’t wanna see you around (I don't want to see you around x2)
Cause i know you’re gonna be someone
Gonna be someone else (You gonna be someone x2)
And still it hurts to say
Yeah still it hurts to say
I need you
I need youEmbed Be Someone Be Someone KVSH;Schillist;Ray X Ben brazil
