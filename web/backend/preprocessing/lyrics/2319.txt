Wanting your love to come into me
Feeling it slow, over this dream
Touch me with a kiss
Touch me with a kiss
Now you're above feeling it still
Tell me it's love, tell me it's real
Touch me with a kiss, feel me on your lips

[Chorus]
'Cause this is where
I wanna be
Where it's so sweet
And heavenly
I'm giving you all my, giving you all my
Giving you all my love
Giving you all my, giving you all my
Giving you all my love
All my love

[Verse 2]
Needing you now to come into me
Feeling it slow, over this dream
Touch me with a kiss
Feel me on your lips
When you're above feeling it still
Tell me it's love, tell me it's real
Touch me with a kiss, touch me with a kiss
