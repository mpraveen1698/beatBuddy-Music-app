I'm comin' up too thin
And breakin' off, the words you said aren't livin' up
And I don't think we've done enough and
I live with what I did
Somewhere in between, it's hard for me to say
I'm not sure which side to hate

[Verse]
Please don't try and sympathize
I'm fallin' out and switchin' sides
You've been here twenty times or more
I've seen you somewhere else before this
You keep on slippin' through my fingertips
I'm fallin' forwards
Dancin' to an endless song
Nothin' can fix what we've done now

[Bridge]
I can't pick either side
Either or is suicide
Shit hurts worse the second time
And I'm caught in between the lines now

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up too thin
And breakin' off, the words you said aren't livin' up
And I don't think we've done enough and
I live with what I did
Somewhere in between, it's hard for me to say
I'm not sure which side to hate

I'm comin' up too thin
And breakin' off, the words you said aren't livin' up
And I don't think we've done enough and
I live with what I did
Somewhere in between, it's hard for me to say
I'm not sure which side to hate3Embed INBETWEEN UNDERGROWTH LIL DUSTY G sad
