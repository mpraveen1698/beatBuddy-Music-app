32 ContributorsProud Mary Lyrics[Intro: Tina Turner, Ike Turner, Both]
Y'know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy
Left a good job down in the city
But there's just one thing
You see, we never, ever do nothing
Working for the man every night and day
Nice and easy
Well, I never lost one minute of sleeping
We always do it nice and rough
Worrying 'bout the way that things might've been
So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Big wheel, keep on turning
But then we're going to do the finish rough
Proud Mary, keep on burning
This is the way we do "Proud Mary"
And we're rolling, ooh
Rolling, ooh
Rolling on the river
Listen to the story

[Verse 1: Ike Turner & Tina Turner, Ike Turner]
Left a good job down in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
I was worrying 'bout the way that things might have been
You might also like[Chorus: Tina Turner, Ike Turner, Both]
You know that big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary, keep on burning
And we're rolling (rolling)
Rolling, yeah (rolling)
Rolling on the river (rolling on the river)

[Verse 2: Tina Turner, Ike Turner, Both]
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
You know I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

[Chorus: Tina Turner, Ike Turner, Both]
You know the big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary, keep on burning
And we're rolling (rolling)
Rolling, yeah (rolling)
Rolling on the river (rolling on the river)
Said we're rolling (rolling)
Rolling, yeah (rolling)
Rolling on the river (rolling on the river)

[Verse 3: Tina Turner]
Oh, I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way things might have been
[Chorus: Tina Turner, The Ikettes, Both]
Big wheel, keep on turning (turning)
Proud Mary, keep on burning (burning)
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river
Say we're rolling
We're rolling
Rolling on the river

[Post-Chorus: Tina Turner, Tina Turner & The Ikettes]
River, do do do do do do do do do do
Alright!

[Verse 4: Tina Turner]
I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

[Chorus: Tina Turner, The Ikettes, Both]
Big wheel, keep on turning (turning)
Proud Mary, keep on burning (burning)
And we're rolling
Said we're rolling
We're rolling on the river
I tell you, we're rolling
Rolling
We're rolling on the river
[Post-Chorus: Tina Turner, Tina Turner & The Ikettes]
River, do do do do do do do do do do

[Verse 5: Tina Turner]
If you come down to the river
I bet you gonna find some people who live
And you don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give

[Chorus: Tina Turner, The Ikettes, Both]
Big wheel, keep on turning (turning)
Proud Mary, keep on burning (burning)
And we're rolling
