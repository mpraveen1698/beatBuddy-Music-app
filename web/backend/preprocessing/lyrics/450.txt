You're all I ever wanted
So, how come I'm still haunted
By the thoughts inside my head?
You love me, but no matter what you say
There's only one of two ways
That this is gonna end

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone dies or someone gets hurt
But if one of us dies

[Chorus]
I hope I die first
'Cause I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna ever learn
How to fall asleep without you
Tell me what's worse
Losing you now or later
Maybe I can break the curse
And I can be in love forever
If I die

[Verse 2]
You're my fire and my safety
You never mean to break me
And that's why I'm afraid
'Cause someday, everybody's leaving
You promise that you'll stay
But that's a promise you can't make

I can be in love forever, love forever, love forever

[Bridge]
Can't escape it, that's how it works
Someone dies or someone gets hurt
But if one of us dies

[Chorus]
I hope I die first

I don't wanna ever learn
How to fall asleep without you

I hope I die first
I can be in love forever, love forever, love forever
If I die first
I hope I die first
I can be in love forever, love forever, love forever8Embed die first die first Nessa Barrett electro
