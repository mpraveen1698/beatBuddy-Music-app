7 ContributorsNothing’s Perfect Lyrics[Verse 1]
You promised me so much, now I am left empty
Every time you showed up, you turned and reject me
This is not the way things were when it had started
You just leave me waiting
Now my heart is guarded, darling

[Chorus]
Don't tell me how you love me
While I'm here, left with nothing
Don't tell me you are coming
While I'm here, left with nothing
All along, it's not worth it
I know nothing's perfect
All along, I've been hurting
I know nothing's perfect

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
This is going nowherе, I can't see a future
I've nevеr been so scared, I feel like a loser
This is not the way we thought it would be going
Why you gotta say things that leave my heart broken, darling?

[Chorus]
Don't tell me how you love me
While I'm here, left with nothing
Don't tell me you are coming
While I'm here, left with nothing
All along, it's not worth it
I know nothing's perfect
All along, I've been hurting
I know nothing's perfect
