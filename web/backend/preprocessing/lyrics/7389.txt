8 ContributorsGround Zero Lyrics[Intro - Chorus]
The fights, the falls, the scars and broken bones
Beneath it all, the cracks begin to show
The hurt, the hate, we're no better off alone
Than a time bomb
Don’t let it explode

Ooh, drop the beat!

[Verse 1]
There's a voice in my head
Telling me I'm not right, wanting me to fall
There’s a place inside me
Where everything is dark, I don't care anymore
There's a thousand reasons
Telling me it's too bright living in the limelight
Every choice is mine to bear, mine alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Flawless is a fiction, imperfection makes us whole
The weight that holds you down, let it go

[Chorus]
The fights, the falls, the scars and broken bones
Beneath it all, the cracks begin to show
The hurt, the hate, we're no better off alone
Than a time bomb
Don't let it explode

I've got friends beside me
Telling me it's all right, waiting on my call
There’s a place they showed me
Where I can find peace in the eye of the storm
There’s a thousand reasons
Telling me it's not right giving up the fight
I got you beside me when my back’s against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
Flawless is a fiction, imperfection makes us whole
The weight that holds you down, let it go

[Chorus]
The fights, the falls, the scars and broken bones
Beneath it all, the cracks begin to show
The hurt, the hate, we're no better off alone
Than a time bomb

[Pre-Chorus]
Flawless is a fiction, imperfection makes us whole
The weight that holds you down, let it go, go, go
Break through

[Breakdown]
Break through
Live like life depends on it
Live like life depends on
[Chorus]
The fights, the falls, the scars and broken bones
Beneath it all, the cracks begin to show
The hurt, the hate, we're no better off alone
Than a time bomb
Don't let it explode

[Outro]
Explode
Don’t let it explode
Don't let it, don't let it explodeEmbed Ground Zero Darker Still Parkway Drive metalcore
