(No!)

[Chorus]
Dig, bury me underneath
Everything that I am rearranging
Dig, bury me underneath
Everything that I was slowly changing

[Verse 1]
I would love to beat the face
Of any motherfucker that's thinkin' they can change me
White knuckles grip pushing through for the gold
If you're wantin' a piece of me I broke the mother fuckin' mold

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm drowning in your wake
Shit rubbed in my face
Teething on concrete
Gums bleeding

[Chorus]
Dig, bury me underneath
Everything that I am rearranging
Dig, bury me underneath
Everything that I was slowly changing

I struggle in violated space
Sell out motherfuckers in the biz that try to fuck me
Hang from their T's rated P.G. insight
I ain't sellin' my soul when there's nothing to buy

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm livid in my space
Pissing in my face
Fuck you while you try
To fuck me

[Chorus]
Dig, bury me underneath
Everything that I am rearranging
Dig, bury me underneath
Everything that I was

[Post-Chorus]
You ain't fuckin' changing me
Dig, dig, dig, dig
C'mon, motherfucker, dig
C'mon, motherfucker, dig
C'mon, motherfucker, dig

[Bridge]
Let me help you tie the rope around your neck
Let me help to talk you the wrong way off the ledge
Let me help you hold the Glock against your head
Let me help you tie the rope around your neck
Let me help to talk you the wrong way off the ledge
Let me help you hold the Glock against your head
Let me help to chain the weights onto your legs
Get on the plank, fuck
[Chorus]
Dig, bury me underneath
Everything that I am rearranging
Dig, bury me underneath
Everything that I was slowly changing

[Outro]
Wish you were committing suicide
Suckin' on a motherfuckin' tailpipe
Dead man walking on a tight rope
Limbless in the middle of a channel
