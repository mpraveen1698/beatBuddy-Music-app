3 ContributorsInsane Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why are you lying?
Telling me things far from the truth?
I don't understand, I am your man
I just don't know what to do
I think the best thing is for me to go
I think the best thing is for me to go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you won't let me go, won't let me go
Won't let me go now
You're rippin' my clothes, rippin' my clothes
Rippin' my soul out
I think the best thing is for me to go
I think the best thing is for me to

[Chorus]
Let me get back to my cog on the stage
I know punching me just makes you feel safe
But now babe, I know you are insane
(You are insane, yeah)
Even though I know it's fucked, I continuе baiting
I think we are out of luck, yeah, it's timе to let go
Oh no, just let go

[Verse 2]
Why can't you just talk to me?
I don't see what's so hard
Act like you're my best friend
Maybe you could find my heart
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you won't let me go, won't let me go
Won't let me go now
You're rippin' my clothes, rippin' my clothes
Rippin' my soul out
I think the best thing is for me to go
I'll go, yeah

[Chorus]
Let me get back to my cog on the stage
I know punching me just makes you feel safe
But now babe, I know you are insane
(You are insane, yeah)
Even though I know it's fucked, I continue baiting
I think we are out of luck, yeah, it's time to let go
Oh no, just let go
It feels we're always standing at the crossroads

[Outro]
Just let go
I can see now, I've been blinded by you
Just let go
I can see now, I've been blinded by youEmbed Insane Insane Sky McCreery chill
