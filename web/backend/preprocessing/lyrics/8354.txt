2 ContributorsMy Love Lyrics[Intro]
My love, so good
My love, just for you, oh
I wanna shower you with kisses, 'cause you're my love

[Verse 1]
I ain't got no story, not much to tell
Ain't got no rep for you, baby, I don't do well
And I know you've only known me for a short time
Life's history ain't what it's made up to be, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Some people spend their time
Runnin' away from what's right
I sure don't wanna run
I sure don't wanna run from you, baby
Here is what I could do

[Chorus]
My love, so good
My love, it's just for you, oh
So good
My love, here is what I could do

Some people spend their time
Runnin' away from what's right
I sure don't wanna run
I sure don't wanna run from you, baby
