18 ContributorsLove Drunk Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
Top down in the summer sun
The day we met was like a hit-and-run
And I still taste it on my tongue (Taste it on my tongue)
The sky was burning up like fireworks
You made me want you oh so bad, it hurt
But girl, in case you haven't heard

[Chorus]
I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
Love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me cryin', say hello to goodbye (Oh, yeah)
'Cause just one sip (Oh, yeah) would make me sick
I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
Love you forever, but now it's over

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Hot sweat and blurry eyes
We're spinnin' 'round a roller coaster ride
The world stuck in black and white (Stuck in black and white)
You drove me crazy every time we touched
Now I'm so broken that I can't get up
Oh girl, you make me such a lush

I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
Love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me cryin', say hello to goodbye (Oh, yeah)
'Cause just one sip (Oh, yeah) would make me sick
I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
Love you forever, but now it's over

[Bridge]
All the time I wasted on you
All of the bullshit you put me through
I'm checkin' into rehab 'cause everything that we had
Didn't mean a thing to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
Love you forever, but now I'm sober

[Chorus]
I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
Love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me cryin', say hello to goodbye (Oh, yeah)
'Cause just one sip (Oh, yeah) would make me sick
I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
Love you forever, but now it's over
