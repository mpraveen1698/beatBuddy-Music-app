6 ContributorsAll Is Well Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know what it is
But I'm hoping that all is well
No harvest of green
But it's still my heart to sell
I put everything I had
Into something that didn't grow
Like going on a wild hunt
Shooting arrows without a bow

[Chorus]
But lord, you know it's true
I only want to be with you
Oh, you know it's true
I only want to be with you

[Verse 2]
Death is stopping by
And I'm hoping it's not too late
A filthy bishop to thank
Shaking hands into a fatal stalemate
Trading riches for love
Knock a year or two off of the pin
So got a hundred left to serve
Standing hopeless uncork the gin
You might also like[Chorus]
But lord, you know it's true
I only want to be with you
Oh, you know it's true
I only want to be with you

[Bridge]
Cause all your love
I left it at the door
Don't stop the skies
Let them rain
Let them pour
All your love
I left it at the door
Don't stop your heart
Let it rain
Let it pour
Don't stop these tears
Let them rain
Let them pour
Oh, let them pour
Oh, let them pour
And let them pour

[Outro]
Woe is me
Weary soul
Heeding grief
Your love in my heart
Feels like the ocean breeze
Said your love in my heart
Feels like the ocean breezeEmbed All Is Well You and Me for Now Austin Basham acoustic
