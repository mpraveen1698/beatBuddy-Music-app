8 ContributorsOff Of My Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
We don’t
Have control, no, we’re just powerless tonight
(Na-now our) egos
Are letting go into a thousand little lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I get reckless when you put your hands on my body
Go crazy for that touch, your arms wrapped around me
There's nothing in this world right now that could stop me
You say your heart is mine
But where's your mi-mi-mind?

[Chorus]
Can't stop thinking about the way your body moves
Bad thoughts taking me down, there's nothing I can do
Can't stop thinking about the way your body moves
Get off of my mind I got nothing left to loose

[Post-Chorus]
Get off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind
Get off of my mind I got nothing left to loose
Get off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind
Get off of my mind I got nothing left to loosе

I hope
We don't push it past the point of no rеturn
(Na-now we're) so close
To the fire, I can feel the way it burns

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I get reckless when you put your hands on my body
Go crazy for that touch, your arms wrapped around me
There's nothing in this world right now that could stop me
You say your heart is mine
But where's your mi-mi-mind?

[Chorus]
Can't stop thinking about the way your body moves
Bad thoughts taking me down, there's nothing I can do
Can't stop thinking about the way your body moves
Get off of my mind I got nothing left to loose

[Post-Chorus]
Get off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind
Get off of my mind I got nothing left to loose

[Chorus]
Can't stop thinking about the way your body moves
Bad thoughts taking me down, there's nothing I can do
Can't stop thinking about the way your body moves
Get off of my mind I got nothing left to looseEmbed Off Of My Mind Off Of My Mind Icona Pop;VIZE swedish
