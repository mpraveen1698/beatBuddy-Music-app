1 ContributorBad Times Five Lyrics[Verse 1: C-Lock & (Ross A.M.)]
Penning this shit in, we reminisce in any sense
It’s been eleven minutes since we’ve been feeling effects weirder than this
And since we’re really beginning the tranquility of this energy
Let’s begin this session; enter into the premises
Rest in bliss and let the whip control where your exit is
The destination holds all the answers, man
*Inhale* catch your breath, cause actually when we meet atrocity
We stop and beat it, so it’s not a part of me you see
Trying to sit still as I’m strapped in the car seat
(Fired up is Chris now, cause he’s so on that bomb shit)
Lie in the whip now, see the sky while we’re on this
(Turnt like a windmill, as we float off the ground and)
Fly over this town, and we’re now so above it
(Mind out of this shell, nothing more than we bargained)
I’m not of this realm, and the world now surrounds me
Time travelin’ now, like we’re hurled in the T.A.R.D.I.S

[Chorus]
Father hear my cries
Mother hear my rhymes
Call it faith we’ll see
Further you believe
In life, in strife, a struggle every night you’ll lie
And strike a fire inside
That burns so bright you’ll find your reason why

And I never said I knew anything and I never know what’s coming
But I know who’s got my back
Like a shadow in the night our luck runs dry
It’s bad times five now take control of your life
As I switch to some poetry you’ll know it's me
Ross A.M. not P.M. no sleepin’ on my beats
And I’ll never stop ‘cause I was born to rock the charts
To get to the top and rule the lot of art
And I’ll my haters will see me make it
I got my crew with me
Man, We’ll take it far

[Verse 3: C-Lock]
Penning this shit in, we reminisce in any sense
It’s been eleven months since we’ve been feeling effects weirder than this
And since we’ve all been feeling the tranquility of this energy
Let’s begin this session; enter into the premises
Cold as the wind blows, I’m a heat source as the beat scores
Like a composer, my composure is lobbing over
Polar frozen over up to my shoulders, still I just
Burst out of it and glow like a supernova--hold up
So many kinds of portals at my disposal, oval
Holes that open your soul with a lot of sober exposure
Go into one, hoping it’s fun, now we’re just flowing and flowing
Warp out of orbit, G-force enormous
Fuck a chorus! Ain’t no hook that will pull us out this portal
Fucked out of order, situation normal
Space-whip sinks through the wormhole, space then distorts though
Stretches and bends as we fit through the width of a quarter
Evade Snake’s Abyss and the Whip quickly flips on its shoulder
Never seen this in a minute cauuse we witness Aurora
Borealis as we mosey out this weather forecast
Check the shortmap, get us outta here! Get us outta here!
[Outro: Narrator]
