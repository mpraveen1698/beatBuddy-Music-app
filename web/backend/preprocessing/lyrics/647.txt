Did you stand there all alone?
Oh, I cannot explain what's going down
I can see you standing next to me
In and out somewhere else right now
You sigh, look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that baby face

[Pre-Chorus]
Do-do-do, do-do-do

[Chorus]
You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

[Verse 2]
Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall, you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all, I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydreams
You were only seventeen
So sweet with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

Do-do-do, do-do-do

[Chorus]
You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
If we can find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain

[Bridge]
Do-do, do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do

[Chorus]
You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
If we can find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
