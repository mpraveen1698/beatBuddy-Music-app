(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
Reflections in the mirror, bathroom light
Both hands on the sink, I'm holdin' tight
Why are you still glued in my mind?
Silly little me can't win this fight

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though I know that you are far gone
And instead of maybe moving on
I'm catchin' these feelings, holdin' on to the pieces
It's hittin' me hard now that I'm

[Chorus]
Dancin' with somebody like you
Lose myself in every move
Oh, I hate the things you're makin' me do
Somebody like you
It hurts like hell
Searching for you in someone else
But I can't help myself, I do
Somebody like you

Looking for your Prius in the parking lot
I know it's not there, but it's all I got
Rain is pouring down, drownin' my thoughts
I guess you found yourself another spot

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though I know that you are far gone
And instead of maybe moving on
I'm catchin' these feelings, holdin' on to the pieces
It's hittin' me hard now that I'm

[Chorus]
Dancin' with somebody like you
Lose myself in every move
Oh, I hate the things you're makin' me do
Somebody like you
It hurts like hell
Searching for you in someone else
But I can't help myself, I do
Somebody like you

[Outro]
Somebody like you
Oh, I hate the things you're makin' me do
Somebody like you1Embed Somebody Like U Walkerverse, Pt. I Alan Walker;Au/Ra house
