7 ContributorsCome Around Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ask me a question and I'll try to not reply
A sign you're moving on, you know I'm still asking why
Just be honest (Be honest)
Yeah, be honest, oh, yeah
Too much temptation coming either way you lie
Hiding from something, but you catch me by surprise
And I don't want it (Don't want it)
I don't want it, oh

[Chorus]
Now I feel, I feel it coming around
I feel it coming around again
And all I see is you when I close my eyes
It's you livin' inside my head
Now I feel, I feel it coming around
I feel it coming around again
But all I see is you when I close my eyes
It's you livin' inside my head
(You livin' inside my head)

[Drop]
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it

I was hoping one day I would take my own advice
Too many times I should've thought way more than twice
But you got me
But don't want me, oh

[Chorus]
Now I feel, I feel it coming around
I feel it coming around again
And all I see is you when I close my eyes
It's you livin' inside my head
Now I feel, I feel it coming around
I feel it coming around again
But all I see is you when I close my eyes
It's you livin' inside my head
(You livin' inside my head)

[Drop]
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it
Don't, don't want it
Don't want it
[Chorus]
Now I feel, I feel it coming around
I feel it coming around again
And all I see is you when I close my eyes
It's you livin' inside my head
Now I feel, I feel it coming around
I feel it coming around again
But all I see is you when I close my eyes
It's you livin' inside my head
(You livin' inside my head)Embed Come Around Again Come Around Again Armin van Buuren;Billen Ted;JC Stewart trance
