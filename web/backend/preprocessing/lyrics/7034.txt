10 ContributorsHome for the Summer Lyrics[Verse 1]
We started getting close
Freshman year, when all our friends were smoking cigarettes
And we couldn't stand that secondhand smoke
So we'd leave and drive around until you had to drop me off at home
Swear that was yesterday
But in two weeks I'll be moving south
And you'd be moving to a town that I had never heard of
I wish we had more time, why did I ever wanna grow up?

[Chorus]
You said you'll see me
When we're home for the summer
We won't have to work so we're gonna
Do whatever the hell we wanna
'Cause we know that one day we'll be
Gone from each other

[Verse 2]
We'd wait till after dark
2 AM, we're laying on the ground in my backyard
I told you I'd be waiting there the night that I get back
I hope you don't forget about that

[Chorus]
When we're home for the summer
We won't have to work so we're gonna
Do whatever the hell we wanna
'Cause we know that one day we'll be
Gone from each other
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
We'll have lives in two different suburbs
We'll have families with different lovers
But for now, I know I'll see you when we're
Home for the summer

[Bridge]
I know you've been busy
That's okay
I still can't wait to be

[Outro]
Home for the summer
We won't have to work so we're gonna
Do whatever the hell we wanna
'Cause we know that one day we'll be
Gone from each other
We'll have lives in two different suburbs
We'll have families with different lovers
But for now, I know I'll see you when we're
