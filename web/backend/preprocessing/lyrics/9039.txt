9 ContributorsOn and On Lyrics[Verse 1]
Play until my fingers hurt
Write until I find the words
(Oh woah oh, oh woah oh)
So much that I wanna say
Before the moment slips away
(Oh woah oh, oh woah oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
So hard to find this place
So hard to catch this chase
Now that you fell into me
Hit me like a melody
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh

[Chorus]
Everybody says that nothing ever lasts forever
So I'm hanging on tight trying to keep it all tied together
Everybody says that nothing ever lasts forever
So I'm hanging on tight trying to keep it all tied together
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on, and on and on
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on, and on and on
How do we make this heart beat on and on?

Hold me like a photograph
Fragile like a piece of glass
(Oh woah oh, oh woah oh)
The future's headed for the past
Full of sparks that couldn't last
(Oh woah oh, oh woah oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
So hard to find this place
So hard to catch that flame
Now that you fell into me
Hit me like a melody
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh

[Chorus]
Everybody says that nothing ever lasts forever
So I'm hanging on tight trying to keep it all tied together
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on, and on and on
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on, and on and on
How do we make this heart beat on and on?

[Post-Chorus]
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
[Chorus]
Everybody says that nothing ever lasts forever
So I'm hanging on tight trying to keep it all tied together
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on, and on and on
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on, and on and on
How do we make this heart beat?

[Chorus]
Everybody says that nothing ever lasts forever
So I'm hanging on tight trying to keep it all tied together
How do we make this heart beat on and on?
And on and on, and on and on
How do we make this heartbeat on and on?
And on and on, and on and on
Oh, how do we make this heartbeat on and on?

How do we make this heartbeat on and on?
How do we make this heartbeat on and on?
