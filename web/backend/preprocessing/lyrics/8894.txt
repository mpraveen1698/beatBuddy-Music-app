19 ContributorsToo Much Lyrics[Verse 1]
Break your silence over my chest
Let it follow and I'll do the rest
Kiss me, kill me, I want nothin' less
I'm not afraid of the lonely, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Meet me at the corner, I'll be waitin' for ya
I can take the weight off, weight off of your shoulders
I don't care what hour, if it's rain or shower
Whatever you ask of me, you don't have to worry

[Chorus]
There's no such thing-ing-ing-ing
As too much, as too much
There's no such thing-ing-ing-ing
As too much, as too much
There's no such thing-ing-ing-ing
Thing-ing-ing, thing-ing-ing-ing-ing

[Verse 2]
Empty bottles cloudin' your mind
I know you get (You get) lonely sometimes
Say the (Say the) word and (Word and) I'll makе the drive
I'm not afraid of the lonеly, no

So meet me at the corner, I'll be waitin' for ya
I can take that weight off, weight off of your shoulders
I don't care what hour, if it's rain or shower
Whatever you of ask me, you don't have to worry

[Chorus]
There's no such thing-ing-ing-ing
As too much, as too much
There's no such thing-ing-ing-ing
As too much, as too much (Oh, oh)
There's no such thing-ing-ing-ing
Thing-ing-ing, thing-ing-ing-ing-ing

[Bridge]
I hate the thought of you with tears in your eyes
And I hate the thought of losin' you, you to the lies
By the way, you're talkin', somethin' ain't right
And I know that you're tired

[Chorus]
There's no such thing-ing-ing-ing
As too much (As too much), as too much (Way, way too much)
There's no such thing-ing-ing-ing (Ooh)
As too much (Way too much), as too much (Too much)
There's no such thing-ing-ing-ing
Thing-ing-ing, thing-ing-ing-ing-ing (Ooh)
There's no such thing-ing-ing-ing (Yeah, yeah)
Thing-ing-ing, thing-ing-ing-ing-ing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)1Embed Too Much (feat. Usher) Too Much (feat. Usher) Marshmello;Imanbek;Usher progressive-house
