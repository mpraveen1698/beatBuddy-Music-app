57 ContributorsDonâ€™t Speak Lyrics[Verse 1]
You and me
We used to be together
Every day together, always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end

[Pre-Chorus]
It looks as though
You're letting go
And if it's real, well, I don't want to know

[Chorus]
Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

[Verse 2]
Our memories
They can be inviting
But some are altogether mighty frightening

As we die
Both you and I
With my head in my hands I sit and cry

[Chorus]
Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
No, no, no, don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

[Bridge]
It's all ending
I gotta stop pretending
Who we are

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You and me
I can see us dyin'
Are we?
[Chorus]
Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
No, no, don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
I know what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't speak, don't speak
Don't speak, no
I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
I know you're good
I know you're good
I know you're real good, oh

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
Don't, don't
Ooh-ooh
[Outro]
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Oh, hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, darlin'42Embed Don't Speak Tragic Kingdom No Doubt alt-rock
