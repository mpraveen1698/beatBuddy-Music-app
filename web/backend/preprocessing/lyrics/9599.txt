Touching heaven, touching you
Touching heaven, heaven

Here we are and I need you in your light
Touching heaven, touching you
We can love, come and see me by your side

Like a lovers harmony, such a blissful reverie
My eyes, touching heaven
Kept it faded in a dream
Touching you is touching heaven in my eyes

Touching heavеn, heaven
Touching heavеn, touching you
Touching heaven, heaven
Touching heaven, touching you
Touching heaven, heaven
