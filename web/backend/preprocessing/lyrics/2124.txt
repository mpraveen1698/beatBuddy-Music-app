Don't make me get violent
I want my ring back, baby, that's a diamond
You don't listen anyways, I'll be quiet
I don't really feel like fighting
Don't make me get violent
I want my ring back, baby, that's a diamond
You don't listen anyways, I'll be quiet
I don't really feel like fighting
[Post-Chorus]
Don't make me run away out the back door
I want my clothes back
You say you miss me, so then I drive back to you
I drive back to you
[Verse]
Petals off of flowers, did you ever really love me?
Now my nose is filled with powder
And I think that she's still lovely, oh no
She knows I'm a wreck
I gave you all my trust, and I told you, "Just don't break it"
I promisе that I'll clean up and maybe we can makе it
But no, I think we're both a mess
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me run away out the back door
I want my clothes back
You say you miss me, so then I drive back to you
I drive back to you

Don't make me get violent
I want my ring back, baby, that's a diamond
You don't listen anyways, I'll be quiet
I don't really feel like fighting
Don't make me get violent
I want my ring back, baby, that's a diamond
You don't listen anyways, I'll be quiet
I don't really feel like fighting17Embed Violent Violent carolesdaughter indie-pop
