11 ContributorsMay I Ask Lyrics[Verse 1: Luke]
May I ask you how you've been
Would I have the words to say
I've forgotten how to feel
How to call you by your name

Barely recognize you now
All your words have turned to stone
You've forgotten all my songs
You've forgotten all my love

[Chorus: Luke]
Don't you know, you make me nervous still
You pull my thoughts apart
Though I've been tryna get you off my mind
Give me time cause it still burns my lips
To say your name out loud, my love

[Verse  2: Alexis Kim]
And by now, your smile has changed
You don't look at me the same
It's naive of me to think
That one day you'll miss my name

[Luke & Alexis Kim]
Promises you said you'd keep
Empty lines between the scenes
Was it wrong for me to trust?
I'm still only 17
You might also like[Chorus: Luke & Alexis Kim]
Don't you know, you make me nervous still
You pull my thoughts apart
Though I've been tryna get you off my mind
Give me time cause it still burns my lips
To say your name out loud, my love

[Bridge: Luke & Alexis Kim]
It's just my natural reaction to you
Making me feel like I lost sanity
And I can't help but to miss you
Though I know there's never a chance

[Chorus: Luke & Alexis Kim]
Don't you know, you make me nervous still
You pull my thoughts apart
Though I've been tryna get you off my mind
Give me time cause it still burns my lips
To say your name out loud, my love3Embed May I Ask May I Ask Luke Chiang;Alexis Kim chill
