My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart

[Verse 2]
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

[Bridge]
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

[Verse 3]
But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's DayYou might also like5Embed My Funny Valentine Chet Baker Sings Chet Baker jazz
