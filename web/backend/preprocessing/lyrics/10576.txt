Rather than love, than money, than faith, than fame, than fairness, give me truth

[Hook]
Feelings  come and go, time to hit the road
Can’t  afford to watch this time move past
I'm never going back, moving forward
Lying to yourself, you don’t really need me
Fiction  in your head that you keep on believing
People  come and go, everybody knows
Love is potent, let you go
Had  to let you go, now I’m hoping
You get closure
Cause I’m feeling so much better now we're over

[Verse 1]
With you, it ain’t right
Too  many missed calls and long nights
I heard your voicemail too many times
And I ain't wasting all my love on you
With you, it ain’t right
Too many missed calls and long nights
I heard your voicemail too many times
And I ain't wasting all my love on you

[Verse 2]
Open up my chest deep into my heart, do you see it?
A shard of glass, I can feel it slice
As I’m breathing, it cut my strings
Now my fucking heart isn’t beating
And from my brain is where I’m bleeding, like
Deep inside my mind, scared of what I’ll find
Our memories linger
Hurt confined, love the way you’d lie
With a smile, I’m saving me
There’s no wrong or right
This is survival, put me down
You'd put me in the ground, no revival
You might also like[Verse 3]
No revival, no survival
I'm 51:50, suicidal
There’s no way out as far as I see
I’m going through hell
Can you find me?
No revival, no survival
I'm 51:50, suicidal
There’s no way out as far as I see
I’m going through hell
Can you find me?

[Sample]
This is fucking insane
Do you know what the definition of insanity is?
No! Do you?
Yes! It’s the inability to relate to another human being
It’s the inability…to love!

[Verse 4]
Boy you left me down
Broken on the ground, I'm so sad
Cause you're always gone, out there on the road
I’m not mad, I just wish that you would call me sometime
I just wish that we could fucking rewind, but
Girl, you let me down
You been running round, I'm not dumb
Got me staring down the barrel of a loaded gun
You burned our bridge
And we can’t turn back time
I got to go before I lose my mind
[Hook]
Feelings come and go, time to hit the road
Can’t afford to watch this time move past
I'm never going back, moving forward
Lying to yourself, you don’t really need me
Fiction in your head that you keep on believing
People come and go, everybody knows
Love is potent, let you go
Had to let you go, now I’m hoping
You get closure
Cause I’m feeling so much better now we're over

[Outro]
Going, going, gone
I think my soul is moving on, oh
Hate me while I’m here
Then love me while I’m lost
Do we fight to feel the pain
Or do we bleed to feel the same?
Why’s the world so fucking cold?
Why do I often feel alone?
Going, going, gone
I think my soul is moving on, oh
Hate me while I’m here
Then love me while I’m lost
Do we fight to feel the pain
Or do we bleed to feel the same?
Why’s the world so fucking cold?
Why do I often feel alone?
[Sample]
What the hell are you running from?
You know, I can ask you the same question
Except, I already know the answer7Embed Fiction Fiction Lund chill
