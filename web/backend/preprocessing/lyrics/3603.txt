Stay awake
Fall asleep
Take a look at what you think and what you really need to keep
My atoms are indivisible
Shut it up
Run it down
Live a life that's underground, a heated love that's not allowed
A Dum Dum Club is inadmissible

[Chorus]
Let's make a wish as we enter the lift
'Cause the system's a relative bore
The drummer is leaning without any meaning
Outside of the Club Troubadour
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore

[Verse 2]
Walk it back
Get the knack
Information to unpack, a guitar in a gunny sack
My best move is in the criminal

[Chorus]
Let's make a wish as we entеr the lift
'Cause the systеm's a relative bore
The drummer is leaning without any meaning
Outside of the Club Troubadour
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore

Let's move like the Chapatula do
I'd be down to wallow in New Orleans
See-through sunrise on the Waterloo
Slits are rather fancy when they're forming, I do

[Verse 3]
Better days
On the way
Flowing like a manta ray, the Dodgers made a double play
My dance moves are sub-subliminal

[Chorus]
Let's make a wish as we enter the lift
'Cause the system's a relative bore
The drummer is leaning without any meaning
Outside of the Club Troubadour
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore, oh

[Outro]
Listen to my one request
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore1Embed The Drummer Return of the Dream Canteen Red Hot Chili Peppers alt-rock
