Ha

[Verse 1]
Everything sucks, just kidding
Everything is great, no really
I haven't thought about my ex today
Oh, wait–(Fuck, I just did)
But I went outside for the first time
In a few days and it felt nice
And I might try doing exercise (Haha, not really)

[Chorus]
I wanna forget my bad days, all my bad days
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade
And then I'll say, I'll say

[Verse 2]
Everything sucks, just kidding
Everything is better than it used to be
I didn't write a song about my ex today
(Oh, wait–um)
But I called my friends and I told them
We should hang out if it makes sense
'Cause I miss thеm and I hate being alone (No, rеally)

I wanna forget my bad days, all my bad days
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade
And then I'll say, I'll say
I wanna forget my bad days, all my bad days
And be okay, and be okay
Spend my spare change down at the arcade
And then I'll say, I'll say
I wanna forget my bad days, all my bad days (Oh-oh-oh)
And be okay, and be okay (Oh)
Spend my spare change down at the arcade (Oh-oh)
And then I'll say, I'll say
