Na because of you I compromise

Should I come to yours or you come to mine?
Anyhow e be, we go compromise

[Verse 2: Fireboy DML]
I no go mind if you pass the night
I no get answer if you ask me why (No)
All that i know is I love you
And I cannot let this moment pass me by
I looked into her eyes and asked her 'what is love?
She say 'love is sacrifice.'
If I have to die
Bring me back to life
Call on me, call on me
Anytime you need me just call on me
Kolobi, kolobi
Say na only you I want to kolobi
Iwo nikan lo mo color mi
Iwo nikan ni mo le soro si
Iwo nikan ni mo le gboran si
Iwo nikan lo le gba ponron mi
