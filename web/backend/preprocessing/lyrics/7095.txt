57 ContributorsFaggot Lyrics[Refrain]
I been denied all the best ultrasex
I been denied all the best ultrasex

[Verse 1]
I, I try to consume
Just like a super faggot, I get subdued
How can y'all
Bring a motherfucker something so good he couldn't say no?
You nailed me hard
I love them when they don't give a motherfucking shit
I could've been someone
Instead of falling flat upon my ass

[Chorus]
Dig me now and fuck me later
And sing it to the tune of, "Faggot, faggot, faggot"
Oh, dig me now and fuck me later
And sing it with that

[Refrain]
I been denied all the best ultrasex
I been denied all the best ultrasex

[Verse 2]
I, I could've been a star
It freaks me out when I sound just like my mom
I could've rocked the spot
Instead of being just another faggot like I am
I played that shit straight
Blowing suckers on the side, hoping I get laid
Now everybody knows
No way in hell I can ever live it down
You might also like[Chorus]
Dig me now and fuck me later
And sing it to the tune of, "Faggot, faggot, faggot"
Oh, dig me now and fuck me later
And sing it with that

[Refrain]
I been denied all the best ultrasex
I been denied all the best ultrasex

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
I could've been someone
Instead of falling flat upon my ass

[Chorus]
Dig me now and fuck me later
And sing it to the tune of, "Faggot, faggot, faggot"
Oh, dig me now and fuck me later
And sing it with that

[Refrain]
I been denied all the best ultrasex
I been denied all the best ultrasex
[Outro]
