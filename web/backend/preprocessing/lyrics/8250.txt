Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall, everyone stands
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your

[Pre-Chorus]
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold
Speak to me

[Chorus]
When all you gotta keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along

[Verse 2]
So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your

[Pre-Chorus]
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold
Speak to me
