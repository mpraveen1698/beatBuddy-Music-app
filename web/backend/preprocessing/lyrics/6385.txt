Birds flying high
You know how I feel
The sun in the sky
You know how I feel

[Chorus]
Breeze driftin' on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
And I'm feeling gud

[Pre-Drop]
Feeling gud, feeling gud, feeling gud, feeling gud
Gud, Gud, Gud, Gud

[Drop]
And I'm feeling gud
And I'm feeling gud
And I'm feeling gud

[Verse]
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
The sun in the sky
You know how I feel

It's a new dawn, it's a new day
And I'm feeling gud

[Pre-Drop]
Feeling gud, feeling gud, feeling gud, feeling gud
Gud, Gud, Gud, Gud

[Drop]
And I'm feeling gud
And I'm feeling gud
And I'm feeling gud

[Outro]
And I'm feeling gud
