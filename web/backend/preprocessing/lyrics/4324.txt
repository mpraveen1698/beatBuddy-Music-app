We know that this won't last
Not like it used to
And I'm okay with that
But not if I lose you

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
I can feel it in my bones
Sinking deeper in the overflow
Can you feel it in your soul?
If I'm honest

[Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
Maybe we're better off alone
(Better off, better off alone)
Maybe we're better off alone
(Better off, better off alone)
Maybe we're better off

[Post-Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
Maybe we're better off alone
Maybe we're better off

[Verse 2: Chelsea Cutler]
I won't turn my back
Now that you want to
And if there's nothing left
Why does it haunt you?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Chelsea Cutler]
I can feel it take control
Falling further in the undertow
Can you feel it in your soul?
If I'm honest

[Chorus: Chelsea Cutler & Jeremy Zucker]
Maybe we're better off alone
(Better off, better off alone)
Maybe we're better off alone
(Better off, better off alone)
Maybe we're better off

[Post-Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
Maybe we're better off alone
Maybe we're better off

[Outro: Jeremy Zucker & Chelsea Cutler]
I can feel it in my bones
Running circles 'cause you're all I know
And I feel it in my soul
