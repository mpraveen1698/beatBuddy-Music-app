You are my everything
My everything
My everything
You are my everything
My everything

[Verse]
비가 내리는 날엔
우리 방안에 누워 아무 말이 없고
감은 눈을 마주 보면 모든 게 우리 거야
조금 핼쑥한 얼굴로 날 찾아올 때도
가끔 발칙한 얘기로 날 놀랠킬 때도

[Chorus]
You are my everything
My everything
My everything
You are my everything
My everything

[Outro]
넌 내 모든 거야
내 여름이고 내 꿈이야
넌 내 모든 거야
나 있는 그대로 받아줄게요

You are my everything
My everything

You are my everything
My everything

[Verse]
On rainy days
We lay together in our room, not saying a word
When I'm looking into your eyes, everything becomes ours
Even when you come to me, sad
Even when you surprise me with a cheeky story

[Chorus]
You are my everything
My everything
My everything
You are my everything
My everything

[Outro]
You are my everything
You are my summer and my dream
You are my everything
I'll take you as you are10Embed EVERYTHING TEAM BABY The Black Skirts indie-pop
