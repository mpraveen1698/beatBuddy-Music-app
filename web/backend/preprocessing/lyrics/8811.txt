2 ContributorsMelodies Lyrics[Verse 1: Nomi Bontegard]
Could you please play it for me?
Just one more time before you leave, oh
Although I've heard it more than a million times
I come alive

[Chorus: Nomi Bontegard]
When you play your guitar
I can still hear all the melodies
I'll never forget, never forget
All the perfect melodies
You played your guitar
All the memories appear to me
I'll never forget, never forget
All the perfect melodies

[Drop]

[Verse 2: Nomi Bontegard]
Each time you play it for me
I can clearly hear the words you always try to say to me
And I, I, I will always be alright
The music is my guide

[Chorus: Nomi Bontegard]
When you play your guitar
I can still hear all the melodies
I'll never forget, never forget
All the perfect melodies
You played your guitar
All the memories appear to me
I'll never forget, never forget
All the perfect melodies
