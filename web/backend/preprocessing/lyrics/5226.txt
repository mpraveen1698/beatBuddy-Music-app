15 ContributorsAugust Lyrics[Intro]
August, honey
Tasted sweeter with you
Sticky fingers
From your old residue

[Verse 1]
Do you remember?
You used to breathe so loud
Do you remember?
The taste, the sound
And it sounded so damn good
And it tasted just like it should

[Chorus]
We don't talk about it
We don't have the time
We thought love was something
We weren't meant to find
But now you're a stranger
And I'm still July
But don't you remember?
August, honey, you were mine

[Bridge]
Well, I've loved you from the start
And I've loved you from the start

We don't have the time
We thought love was something
We weren't meant to find
But now you're a stranger
And I'm still July
But don't you remember?
August, honey, you were mine

[Bridge]
Well, you were mine
And you were mine
Well, you were mine

[Chorus]
We don't talk about it
We don't have the time
We thought love was something
We weren't meant to find
But now you're a stranger
And I'm still July
But don't you remember?
August, honey, you were mine7Embed August Citrona flipturn j-rock
