27 ContributorsCrush Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanna line my walls with photographs you sent
Of you lying in your swimsuit on the bed
Can't live without your love inside me now
I'll find a way to slip into your skin, somehow

[Chorus]
I wanna fuck your love slow
Catch my heart, go swim
Feel your lips crush
Hold you here, my loveliest friend

[Instumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I love to watch you when you're trying on your clothes
And now you're all I think about when I'm alone
Can't wait to feel your love inside me now
We'll have a drink or two and we'll go to your house

[Chorus]
I wanna fuck your love slow
Catch my heart, go swim
Feel your lips crush
Hold you here, my loveliest friend
