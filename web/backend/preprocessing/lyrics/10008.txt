Baby, I
Can't decide, I
Need your guidance, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I got nobody left to lose
When I fall, I turn to you
And the world just got confusin'
And I think you need me too
You want a night out, fucked up, don't know where to find ya
Drive so fast and we runnin' red lights—igh—igh
Night out, fucked up, don't know where to find ya
Shit won't last, but I wanna make right

[Pre-Chorus]
So can we talk for a minute, talk for a minute?
So can we talk for a minute, talk for a minute?

[Chorus]
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk (Baby, I)
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough (Can't decide, I)
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough (Need your guidance)
Maybe we don't talk like we used to
Like we— like we used to
Talk enough, talk enough
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough
Maybe we don't talk like we used to
Like we— like we used to

She got me runnin' 'round town, I surrender all of me
Oh my God, I'll give you anything you want
Maybe I forgot why you left in the first place
Way too many friends gettin' close on yo'—
Got me runnin' 'round town, I surrender all of me
(Got nobody left to lose)
Oh my God, I'll give you anything you want
(When I fall, I turn to you)
Maybe I forgot why you left in the first place
(And the world just got confusin')
Way too many friends gettin' close on yo' birthday
(And I think you need me too)

[Pre-Chorus]
So can we talk for a minute, talk for a minute?
So can we talk for a minute, talk for a minute?

[Chorus]
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough (Baby, I)
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough (Can't decide, I)
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough (Need your guidance)
Maybe we don't talk like we used to
Like we— like we used to
Talk enough, talk enough
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough
Maybe we don't talk enough, talk enough
Talk like we used to, like we— like we used to5Embed talk always keshi chill
