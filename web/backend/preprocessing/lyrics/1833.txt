You can skip this intro
I-I have a low attention span too, so don't worry about it
I love you, David
Yeah, yes
I think the thing about cartoon characters is like
You can imagine how they would look
Like, you can just choose how they would look (Yeah), you know?

[Chorus]
She look like Marceline, when she pop a bean
And she rock with me, I pull up to the scene
She's a fiend, strawberry ice cream
Meet me at the tree, and she asks, "Are you scared of me?"
Yeah, I am, but it don't matter, 'cause you look like
Marceline, when she pop a bean
And she rock with me, I pull up to the scene
She's a fiend, strawberry ice cream
Meet me at the tree, and she asks, "Are you scared of me?"
Yeah, I am, but it don't matter, 'cause I see you in my dreams

[Verse]
Play guitar (Jimi Hendrix), shawty really got it all (She does)
I won't stall (No way), be there at the crack of dawn (Time)
I'm a man now (Goatee), now she wanna fall
Say she want my love, but she don't know who to call (Who to call)
If I shoot my shot (Jordan), then I better not miss (Damn)
Shawty mentioned that she likes roses and gifts (She does)
I know that's a lie 'cause when I tried, she got pissed (quarrel)
Go outside, you're looking pale, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it (I'm sorry)

I feel like Adventure Time
Like, when I was younger
After watching some of the episodes
I always got— like, had like an existential crisis and stuff like that
Like, it's a good show, but it's definitely kind of depressing (Yeah)

[Chorus]
She look like Marceline, when she pop a bean
And she rock with me, I pull up to the scene
She's a fiend, strawberry ice cream
Meet me at the tree, and she asks, "Are you scared of me?"
Yeah, I am, but it don't matter, 'cause you look like
Marceline, when she pop a bean
And she rock with me, I pull up to the scene
She's a fiend, strawberry ice cream
Meet me at the tree, and she asks, "Are you scared of me?"
Yeah, I am, but it don't matter, 'cause I see you in my dreams2Embed MARCELINE MARCELINE Lil God Dan sad
