22 ContributorsDown the Line Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't want your Wall Street
Don't got no degree
Written on the concrete
A-C-A-B
Couldn't really tell you
What I'm trying to find
Everyone's so boring
Makes me wanna to lose my mind

[Chorus]
So call me up tonight
If you need somewhere to get out of the light
These days I feel like I do nothing right
So come with me and we'll go down the line

[Verse 2]
I'm thinking of you fondly
When I'm on the train
I really hate your poetry
You hate mine the same

[Chorus]
So call me up tonight
If you need somewhere to get out of the light
These days I feel like I do nothing right
So come with me and we'll go down the line
