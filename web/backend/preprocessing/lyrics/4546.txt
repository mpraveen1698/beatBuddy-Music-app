5 Contributors13 Missed Calls Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm just tryna be alone now
I just need a fuckin' comedown
How can you not see it's over?
Hit me back when you get sober

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got 13 missed calls from the devil herself
She looks like an angel but she's bad for my health
Keeps pulling me under from heaven to hell
I've got 13 missed calls from the devil

[Chorus]
So tonight I'm gonna let it go
It's just me, myself, and my Patron
Lost and floatin' through a crowd of smoke
You're always saying that you're gonna change
But you always seem to stay the same
Fill my cup to help me numb the pain

[Verse 2]
You try to tell me that I don't carе
You need to stop you know that's not fair
I know you're looking for some drama
And that's why I ain't gonna call ya
You might also like[Chorus]
So tonight I'm gonna let it go
It's just mе, myself, and my Patron
Lost and floatin' through a crowd of smoke
You're always saying that you're gonna change
But you always seem to stay the same
Fill my cup to help me numb the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got 13 missed calls from the devil herself
She looks like an angel but she's bad for my health
Keeps pulling me under from heaven to hell
I've got 13 missed calls from the devil

[Voicemail]
"Hey, I've been thinkin' about you"

[Chorus]
So tonight I'm gonna let it go
It's just me, myself, and my Patron
Lost and floatin' through a crowd of smoke
You're always saying that you're gonna change
But you always seem to stay the same
Fill my cup to help me numb the pain

[Outro]
