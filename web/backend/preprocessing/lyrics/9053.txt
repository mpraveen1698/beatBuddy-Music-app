Ooh-ooh (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ooh-ooh (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1: Jeremy DePoyster, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
I hate when I get left alone
I'm sure that all these calls are getting old
A short drive (A short drive)
Just get me home (Just get me home)
The cost is nowhere near to what I owe

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
From the back of the car, it’s sinking in
Like a shot of fear and adrenaline
I'm a lost cause with nothing left
Can't you see that?

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
My hands are torn up
From all these broken bottles
I can’t stand, lost too much
I know I've got my problems

[Post-Chorus: Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
I know I've got my problems

How did it start? (How did it start?)
This episode (This еpisode's)
Got me crawling and flying
I'm high and I'm low, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
I watch from afar and make my bеts
As you sit back and light a cigarette
A lost cause with nothing left
Can't you see that?

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
My hands are torn up
From all these broken bottles
I can't stand, lost too much
I know I’ve got my problems
Every day I’m afraid
That I might find the bottom
My hands are torn up
I know I've got my problems

[Post-Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
I know I’ve got my problems
I know I've got my problems
[Bridge: Jeremy DePoyster, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
Drink it down, I'm on empty
Shaking now, please don't worry
It surrounds all that I see
I’m on empty

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
My hands are torn up
From all these broken bottles
I can't stand, lost too much
I know I've got my problems
Every day I'm afraid
That I might find the bottom
My hands are torn up
I know I've got my problems

[Outro: Jeremy DePoyster, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
I've got my problems
I know I've got my problems1Embed Broken Color Decay The Devil Wears Prada metalcore
