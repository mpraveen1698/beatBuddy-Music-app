She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul, oh

[Chorus]
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"

[Post-Chorus]
And I
And I

[Verse 2]
Lips, generous and warm
You build me up like steps
Eyes, innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like, oh

[Chorus]
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up

And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its wait
Well, now you've come and gone
I've finally worked it out, I worked it out

[Bridge]
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be?
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be?
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be?
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be?

[Chorus]
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up
[Post-Chorus]
And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its wait
Well, now you've come and gone
I've finally worked it out, I worked it out
