7 ContributorsHunnids Lyrics[Verse 1]
The grinds on I'm just tryna get the bands in
Take mine if you know we get the hands in
Throw fists if you know that they landing
We stand out cah you know we can't stand in
We look good we ain't ever look stranded
In a coupe top down tunes banged in
The YG's outside just standing
Round the corner is a yute tryna bank it

[Hook]
With the bro been wizzin' in the coupe
Treasure hunt looking for the loot
Pit stop, gotta get the food
Put it in the boot
Late night I got a lot to do
Tryna get the bag with my crew
Gotta get it with the crew
Spend a couple hunnids for a shoe
Put a couple hunnids for on my crew
That ain't my boo
Hold on wait that's who?
That's that chick that got rude
I ain't spending on you
I'm just fronting on you
Bro's got suttin' on you
We ain't ever running from you
But we be running on you
Bro's got a gunner on 2
Got a stunner on 2
His boutta run up on you
Bout to hold one up on you
Don't ask what I do
I ain't even moving no food
But I make bits for my crew
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, she knows I chase up the cheddar
Gucci that's Louis my sweater
She like the feel on my leathers
I want a whip want a Tesla
Flexing it round like a wrestler
She know I know I impress her
Like diamonds I'm good under pressure

[Post Chorus]
Now she wanna leave with me
Now she wanna be with me
Come on bro can't you see?
24's getting this cream
Tryna go live up my dream
Mansion crib with my team
Mansion crib with my team

[Bridge]
Yeah
Oh yeah
Gucci that's Louis my sweater
She like the feel on my leathers
Yeah
Oh yeah
She know I know I impress her
Like diamonds I'm good under pressure
[Hook]
With the bro been wizzin' in the coupe
Treasure hunt looking for the loot
Pitstop, gotta get the food
Put it in the boot
Late night I got a lot to do
Tryna get the bag with my crew
Gotta get it with the crew
Spend a couple hunnids for a shoe
Put a couple hunnids for on my crew
That ain't my boo
Hold on wait that's who?
That's that chick that got rude
I ain't spending on you
