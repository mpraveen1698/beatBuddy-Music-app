4 ContributorsFeels Like Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never felt it
Was some kind of mystery
But I finally get it, yeah
Now that you're here with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t get tired of loving you
I don't get tired of us
Every time that I'm touching you
You’re the one that I want
And all the ones that have come before never had me feeling this way
Oh, you know what they say

[Chorus]
When it feels right, you'll know what it feels like
Front seat of a joyride, caught up in a rush
And when I'm by your side, looking into your eyes
That's just what it feels like, feels like
And it feels like love

[Post-Chorus]
And it feels likе love
And it feels like love
Whеn it feels like love
You might also like[Verse 2]
It sounds so dramatic
But I know that you feel the same
Oh, and there's no sign of stopping
Keep taking me all the way

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't get tired of loving you
I don't get tired of us
Every time that I'm touching you
You’re the one that I want
And all the ones that have come before never had me feeling this way
Oh, you know what they say

[Chorus]
When it feels right, you’ll know what it feels like
Front seat of a joyride, caught up in a rush
And when I'm by your side, looking into your eyes
That’s just what it feels like, feels like
And it feels like love

[Post-Chorus]
And it feels like love
And it feels like love
When it feels like loveEmbed Feels Like Love (feat. MIYA MIYA) Feels Like Love (feat. MIYA MIYA) Syn Cole;MIYA MIYA progressive-house
