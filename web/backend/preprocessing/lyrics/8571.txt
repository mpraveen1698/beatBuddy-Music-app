7 Contributors​in my head Lyrics[Intro]
Monty on the track, and he killing it
In my head, in my head
It’s all in my head
In my head, in my head, in my head
It’s all in my head

[Chorus]
You trying to play me, yeah, saying you can save me, yeah
Shawty way too crazy, ain't no maybe, she want my babies, yeah
I want the Mercedes, want 380s, I go crazy, yeah
I'm a superstar, you just sitting on the bleachers
I thought back then that I really, really needed her
Now I'm getting money, I make way more than my teachers
Now the bitches love me, yeah, they play me on they speakers
She wanted attention and my clout, I couldn't keep her

[Verse]
So, what's next?
Keep on moving, but you in my head
Ignore texts, leave you on read
Hard to believe that you was my breath
Cannot forgive all the things that you've done to me
Bitch, I moved on, now you is getting none of me
Ain't pick up the phone, yeah, I swear that shit is dumb to me
Now it's "bye-bye," you officially a dub to me
I don't feel no pain, take these Percys to the brain
I've been acting up, momma called, she said, "You OK?"
Ma, I really love you, but I really think that I'm insane
Bitch, you left a permanent stain

Shawty way too crazy, ain't no maybe, she want my babies, yeah
I want the Mercedes, want 380s, I go crazy, yeah
I'm a superstar, you just sitting on the bleachers
I thought back then that I really, really needed her
Now I'm getting money, I make way more than my teachers
Now the bitches love me, yeah, they play me on they speakers
She wanted attention and my clout, I couldn't keep her3Embed In My Head In My Head Unodavid sad
