4 ContributorsFootsteps in the Dark, Pts. 1 & 2 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Are we really sure
That a love that lasted for so long
Still endures?
Do I, really care?
Hey hey
Let's talk about the distractions going on elsewhere

[Chorus]
I, keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark
Oh, in the dark, woo

[Verse 2]
My mind drifts now and then
Looking down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hey, should I keep this same direction
Or go back instead?

[Chorus]
I, I keep hearing footsteps baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark
Oh, in the dark, hoo
You might also like[Bridge]
Honey, let's stop walking around
When there's love lost to be found
Oh, and you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of going elsewhere?

[Verse 3]
Who feels, really sure?
Can that feeling guarantee your happiness shall endure?
Do we really care?
Hey hey
Let's look at what's been happening and try to be more aware

[Chorus]
I, I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark, ay, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark
Oh, in the dark, hoo

[Outro]
Hey hey, let's stop walking around
Well, when there's love lost, lost to be found
Oh honey, you Know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of going, going elsewhere?
Oh honey, let's stop walking around, and around, and around
When there's no love to be found
Hey baby, you Know I still care, I still care
What's the sense of going, going elsewhere?Embed Footsteps in the Dark, Pts. 1 & 2 Go for Your Guns The Isley Brothers disco
