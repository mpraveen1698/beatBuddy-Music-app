Everybody's happy
Been turning around
Looking for a friendly light
But I see nothing
No eyes, no eyes on me

So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men
So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men

No eyes

It's a lonely night
Everybody's happy
Been turning around
Looking for a friendly light
But I see nothing
No eyes
No eyes, no eyes on me no eyes on me

So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men
So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men

It's a lonely night
Everybody's happy
Been turning around
Looking for a friendly light
But I see nothing
No eyes, no eyes on me
No eyes on me

Near me

Can you see me lying?
Can you see why I contained?
Can you feel me thinking?
Would you save me if I fail?
I would love to love you
I would love to be your man
But the loneliness, please leave me
No eyes
No eyes no eyes
No eyes
No eyes on me

So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men
So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men

It's a lonely night
Everybody's happy
Been turning around
Looking for a friendly light
But I see nothing
No eyes, no eyes on...Embed No Eyes Charmer Claptone;JAW techno
