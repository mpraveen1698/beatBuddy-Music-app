No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be faded
To telling only lies
[Chorus]
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

[Verse 2]
No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free
[Bridge]
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover
[Verse 3]
No one knows what it's like
To be mistreated
To be defeated
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows how to say
That they're sorry
And don't worry
I'm not tellin' lies

[Chorus]
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free
[Outro]
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
