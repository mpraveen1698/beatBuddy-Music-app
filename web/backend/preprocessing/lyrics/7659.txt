Butterfly, butterfly
Where you gonna go tonight
Wish I was just like you
Maybe then you'll take me high

[Pre-Chorus]
Away from it all again
Away from my troubles and my sins
Away from the fears inside
Away from the tears I try to hide away, 'cause

[Chorus]
I just want to make you smile, but
I know that'll take a while, 'cause I'm
Tryin' to find myself
I just want to make you proud, but
I think that I'm runnin' out of time
To figure it out

[Verse 2]
Butterfly, butterfly
Take me on your wings and fly (oh)
Wish I was just like you
Maybe then I'll see the light
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And I could be free again
Free from my troubles and my sins
Free from the tears inside
And free from the fears I try to hide away, 'cause

[Chorus]
I just want to make you smile, but (oh)
I know that'll take a while, 'cause I'm (oh)
Tryin' to find myself (oh)
I just want to make you proud, but (I just wanna)
I think that I'm runnin' out of (I'm runnin' out o')
Time (woah)
To figure it out
To figure it out (oh woah)
Out (oh woah)
Out (oh woah)
To figure it out

[Outro]
Out
To figure it out
I'm try'na figure this out
To figure it out
I'm try'na figure this out
(Out)
