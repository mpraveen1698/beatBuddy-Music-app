7 ContributorsAlways Lyrics[Verse 1]
Remember we were running wild
Never even felt like we were broke
Using friends as alibis
No one ever knew just
Where weâ€™re going
Broken down in bathrooms listening to bad news
Thought you'd never let me go
Are we just too late?
Too late?

[Chorus]
Always
Kiss me like it's always
Take my hand and fall in
Like we did the old days, old days
Tell me you need me or baby just lie
Tell me you staying
And make me feel like always
Just pretend it's always
Kiss me like it's
Always

[Post-Chorus]
Always
Make me feel like always
Just pretend it's always
Kiss me like it's
You might also like[Verse 2]
Then you said you have enough
Running out of money and love
But I know how to call your bluff
Only takes one drink when we were alone now
But when I try to call you
I can never get through
Guess I should just let go
Am I just too late?
Too late?

[Chorus]
Always
Kiss me like it's always
Take my hand and fall in
Like we did the old days, old days
Tell me you need me or baby just lie
Tell me you staying
And make me feel like always
Just pretend it's always
Kiss me like it's
Always

[Post-Chorus]
Always
(Always)
Just make me feel like it's always
(Always)
[Outro]
Always
Kiss me like it's always
Take my hand and fall in
Like we did the old days, old days
Tell me you need me or baby just lie
Tell me you staying
And make me feel like always
Just pretend it's always
Kiss me like it's
Always
