Yeah, okay
Ready guys?

[Verse 1]
I used to think I'd meet the one
At like, a record shop or something fun
You'd drop your keys, I'd pick 'em up
And then I'd give 'em back, our hands would touch

[Chorus]
Wait, slow down, don't think too much
Back up, you've been here for months
Oh, shit, are we in love?
Slow down, no need to rush
Back up, you've been here for months
Oh, shit, are we in love?
I only fell when I gave up

[Verse 2]
I never thought we'd end up here
You changed the reason for my tears
I told you everything, you didn't make it weird
I never thought we'd end up here

[Chorus]
Wait, slow down, don't think too much
Back up, you've been here for months
Oh, shit, are we in love?
Slow down, no need to rush
Back up, you've been here for months
Oh, shit, are we in love?
I only fell when I gave up
You might also like[Bridge]
Summer nights spent layin' on pavement
You're my favorite, I only fell when I gave up
Summer nights spent misbehaving
You're my favorite, I only fell when I gave up

[Chorus]
Oh, shit, are we in love?
Slow down, don't think too much
Back up, you've been here for months
Oh, shit, are we in love?
Slow down, no need to rush
Back up, you've been here for months
Oh, shit, are we in love?
I only fell when I gave up

[Outro]
Summer nights spent layin' on pavement
You're my favorite, I only fell when I gave upEmbed Oh shit…are we in love? Last Birthday Valley indie-pop
