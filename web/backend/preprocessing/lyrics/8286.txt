13 ContributorsEvery Lie LyricsSo where did you sleep the night before?
I doubt that your phone was dying
I'm supposed to believe that was what you wore?
Said you were alone, I don't buy it
Now I can't stay

Surrounded by every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time, now why would you?
Think you're gonna make it right, but how could you?
So I can't stay, surrounded by (surrounded by) every lie

You might as well just stop crying
It doesn't mean much to me anymore
A little too late to start trying
I'm taking this love off of life support
Now I can't stay

Surrounded by every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time, now why would you?
Think you're gonna make it right, but how could you?
So I can't stay, surrounded by (surrounded by) every lie

Surrounded by every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time, now why would you?
Think you're gonna make it right, but how could you?
So I can't stay, surrounded by (surrounded by) every lie

Who haven't you lied to?

With every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time, now why would you?
Think you're gonna make it right, but how could you?
So I can't stay, surrounded by (surrounded by) every lie

Every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time, now why would you?
Think you're gonna make it right, but how could you?
So I can't stay, surrounded by
No I can't stay, surrounded by (surrounded by) every lieEmbed Every Lie My Darkest Days My Darkest Days grunge
