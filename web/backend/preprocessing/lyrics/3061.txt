20 ContributorsValley of Lies Lyrics[Intro: iann dior]
Through the valley of lies
Through the valley of lies

[Chorus: iann dior]
I'm walking through the valley of lies
I see a coffin, perfect fit for my size
They won't open, got silky stitch in my eye
I'm hurting and I lost my heart in the sky

[Verse 1: iann dior]
Taking trips down uncharted roads
Them very lonely roads
Looking for a pot of gold
Your love was not enough
It don't make no sense to me
And now you're begging, "Please"
Remember you was hurting me
Well, keep that energy

[Pre-Chorus: iann dior]
I've been waiting
Knowing you won't show up
Don't make no sense
I'm not
(I'm not giving in)

I'm walking through the valley of lies
I see a coffin, perfect fit for my size
They won't open, got silky stitch in my eye
I'm hurting and I lost my heart in the sky

[Post-Chorus: iann dior, SOOBIN & iann dior]
On, and on, and on (And on)
Keep fighting, Armageddon
Now things are getting rough
I never thought you'd be a lesson
Go, you go, you go
How come I never see ya?
I'm really getting close to giving up
I hate the feeling

[Verse 2: YEONJUN]
Yeah, through the valley of your lies
The water keeps flowing down
You won't believe it's all from my eyes
Thought you were the one (One)
You tarnished our love (Love)
Yeah, with your liar's tongue (Tongue)
After all
You knew that we would end up this way
I never knew my love would turn gray
All our memories in my head
It's time to bury 'em away
Way deep inside the valley
It's gonna be okay, hey

[Chorus: iann dior, HUENING KAI & iann dior]
I'm walking through the valley of lies
(Ah, na-na, na-na, ah, na-na, na-na)
I see a coffin, perfect fit for my size
(Ah, na-na, na-na, ah, na-na, na-na)
They won't open, got silky stitch in my eye
(Ah, na-na, na-na, ah, na-na, na-na)
I'm hurting and I lost my heart in the sky
(Ah, na-na, na-na, ah, na-na, na-na)
