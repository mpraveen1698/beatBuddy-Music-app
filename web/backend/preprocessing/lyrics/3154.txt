Turn away
If you could, get me a drink
Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded
Call my Aunt Marie
Help her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors

[Chorus]
My sisters and my brothers, still
I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you

[Verse 2]
Now turn away
'Cause I'm awful just to see
'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body
Oh, my agony
Know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo

[Chorus]
But counting down the days to go
It just ain't living
And I just hope you know
