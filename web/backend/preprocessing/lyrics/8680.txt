13 ContributorsYouâ€™re Not Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's just like him
To wander off in the evergreen park
Slowly searching
For any sign of the ones he used to love
He says he's got nothing left to live for
(He says he's got nothing left)
And this time I think you'll know

[Chorus]
You're not alone
There is more to this, I know
You can make it out
You will live to tell

[Verse 2]
She's just like him
Spoiled rotten, confused by the lies
She's been fed
And she's searching for no one (but herself)
Her eyes turn to green and she seems to be happy
That she is here
And this time I think you'll know

[Chorus]
You're not alone
There is more to this, I know
You can make it out
You will live to tell
You might also likeYou're not alone
There is more to this, I know
You can make it out

(There is more to know)

[Chorus]
We're not alone
There is more to this, I know
You can make it out
You will live to tell

(So tell me)
You're not alone
There is more to this, I know
You can make it out (make it out)
You will live to tell (live to tell)

You're not alone
There is more to this, I know (and I know)
You can make it out
You will live to tell

[Outro]
You are not alone
You're not, you're not alone2Embed You're Not Alone Saosin Saosin hardcore
