Now here I am with you
I never wanted babies
I know they're kinda cute
I never wanted marriage
But here I am with you
We love to live in chaos
There's nothin' in our way
Our love is deep but fragile

[Pre-Chorus]
No fake grass, no fake friends
That's our plan, yeah, that's our future dance
No pretend, no safe end
That's our plan, no circumstance

[Chorus]
I-I don't want suburbia
I don't need routines and lies
I hope you know that I know
You are the love of my life
But I-I-I can't be no Stepford wife

[Verse 2]
Just let me talk this through
So if we had a baby
You'd love them more than me?
What if I'm way too lazy
For the mom Olympic team? (Ah)
Will we still be romantic?
Will I still get my sleep? (Ah)
Will you be less pedantic?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
No fake grass, no fake friends
That's our plan, yeah, that's our future dance
No pretend, no safe end
That's our plan, no circumstance

[Chorus]
I-I don't want suburbia
I don't need routines and lies
I hope you know that I know
You are the love of my life
But I-I-I can't be no Stepford wife, oh

[Bridge]
What if I change my mind and want one
But then I can't have none?
Would you leave me then? Mm
What if I don't want the things I'm supposed to want?
What then?
But what if I do in the end?

[Chorus]
I-I don't want suburbia (No, no)
I don't need routines and lies (I don't need no lies)
I hope you know that I know (I know)
You are the love of my life
But I can't be no Stepford wife (Oh, no)
I hope you know that I know
You are the love of my life
But I-I-I can't be no Stepford wife3Embed Suburbia Dirt Femme Tove Lo swedish
