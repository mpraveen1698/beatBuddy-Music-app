30 ContributorsGoin Up Lyrics[Intro]
Grrt, boom

[Chorus]
Goin' up, up, up, up, up, up, started on the corner (Up)
Bentley Truck, red guts, couple milli' up, could've been a goner (Up)
I put on for my city, youngest one to do it, this ain't no persona (Up)
Richard Mille on my wrist, oh, shit, nigga, you say what you wanna (Grrt, baow)

[Verse]
I was real from the start, still kinda hard, no love for informers (No)
Been a real nigga, still a real nigga, just a six-figure performer
Focused, I better my life (Yeah), ain't have no place on that corner (None)
They so-so mad, so-so mad, but I'ma keep goin' up
Trap for a livin' (Trap), I was flippin' that pack for a livin' (Pack, pack)
Who'da thought it'd be rap for a livin'? Back in the day I was packin' a Smithen (Grrt, baow)
Lately on my mind, the passion, the vision
Who put the block on the map? Let's petition (Me)
I ain't even finna ask what it is and I'm sturdy, gotta move with tactic decisions
Broski really good at scorin', shootin' while it's pourin'
He ain't good at passin' precision
Late nights tryna catch an opp, hit him in his top (Boom, boom, boom)
Play it cool, get back to the business (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Young nigga livin' the gang way
Every nigga here with me the same way (Okay)
Since a youngin', was playin' that corner (That corner)
Now I'm up and they all on my dangling (My way, oh, oh)
Where I come from, them trenches we oot shit
I don't care 'bout shit, bitch, I'm ruthless (Ruthless)
Pourin' up, I ain't sippin' no Henny
But I might just roll up Delilah to boost it (Boost it)
Suckin' dick, bitch, I'll buy you a toothpick (Yeah)
I can't argue with you 'cause I prove shit (Yeah)
In that bag, look like you on some fool shit (Fuck?)
I'm Mr. Pull-A-String, no acoustic (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Knew when my mama told me I'm a nuisance
Fit cost a couple thousand I go stupid (Yeah)
Show plus a hundred thousand or you stupid (Show)
Straight from the bottom, now that youngin too sick
Can't whip a car unless it's in the deuces (Okay)
I'm just a youngin nigga livin' life (Okay)
They tryna figure me out like a Rubik's (No)
I dare pussy nigga tryna fight (I dare)
Better start duckin', duckin' like the gooses (Grrt, bow)
