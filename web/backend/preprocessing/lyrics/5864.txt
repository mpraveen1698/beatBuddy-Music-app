3 ContributorsEscape (John Summit Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Not invisible, not invisible
Not invisible, not invisible (Is it real)
Not invisible, not invisible
Not invisible, not invisible (What if I escape)
Not invisible, not invisible
Not invisible, not invisible (Is it real)
Not invisible, not invisible
Not invisible

[Chorus]
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape

[Post-Chorus]
Is it real?
Is it real?
Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm

[Verse]
I'm not invisible to you
Do my eyes, do my eyes
Speak true?
My soul's so in touch with yours tonight
Won't let my head, let my head
Take flight
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
We could leave this placе
Freedom, ours to chase
What if I escape with you?

[Chorus]
What if I еscape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not invisible, not invisible
Not invisible, not invisible (Is it real)
Not invisible, not invisible
Not invisible, not invisible (What if I escape with you?)
Not invisible, not invisible
Not invisible, not invisible (What if I escape with you?)
Not invisible, not invisible
Not invisible, not invisible (What if I escape)
Is it real?
