I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

[Chorus]
And I want you, we can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you, we can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it

[Verse 2]
Coldest winter for me
No sun is shinin' anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controllin' my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you, we can bring it on the floor

We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it

[Chorus]
And I want you, we can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you, we can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it198Embed Stolen Dance Sadnecessary Milky Chance german
