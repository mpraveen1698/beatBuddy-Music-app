The curtains are closed now, nothin' to see
But a dozen dying roses at our feet
Your timin' is perfect, ironic to me
Showin' up the moment that you shouldn't be, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Last time I checked
You're the one that left
Last words you said
That you couldn't care less

[Chorus]
It's funny how you miss me
More than you could ever love me
How you couldn't give me everything
And now you want it from me
Yeah, it's funny how it's different
Now that I got somebody
Yeah, it's funny (Yeah, it's funny)
Ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, it's funny, funny, funny
Couldn't answer, answer, answer
'Cause his lips are, lips are, lips are
Both my hands are on his body
Yeah, it's funny how it's different
Now that I got somebody
Yeah, it's funny (Yeah, it's funny)
Ooh

You're the one that left

That you couldn't care less (Ooh)

It's funny how you miss me
