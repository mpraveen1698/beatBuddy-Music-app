1 ContributorCrazy LyricsI know that you're on the inside
You know that I'm looking out
For me
You're sitting pretty
As I wallow in self-pity
And there's no coming back for me


You're crazy for thinking I'm above this
You're crazy for believing I don't care
You're crazy for thinking I'm below you
You're crazy, you're crazy

My ambition and every intention
Is to go where I shouldn't go
Pleasing to my eyes
Through a wretched reply
It's soothing to my soul

You're crazy for thinking I'm above this
You're crazy for believing I don't care
You're crazy for thinking I'm below you
You're crazy, you're crazy

You're crazy for thinking I'm above this
You're crazy for believing I don't care
You're crazy for thinking I'm below you
You're crazy, you're crazy

You're crazy for believing I don't care
You're crazy for thinking I'm below you
You're crazy, you're crazyEmbed Crazy Crazy PLÜM french
