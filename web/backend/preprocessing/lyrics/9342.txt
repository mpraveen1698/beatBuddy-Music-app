Jesus, doesn't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't expect me to cry
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me

[Chorus]
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee

Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't expect me to cry
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me

[Chorus]
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee
