1 ContributorNo Eyes - Radio Edit Lyrics[Verse]
It's a lonely night
Everybody's happy
Been turning around
Looking for a friendly light
But I see nothing

[Chorus]
No eyes
No eyes on me

[Post-Chorus]
So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men
So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men

[Verse]
It's a lonely night
Everybody's happy
Been turning around
Looking for a friendly light
But I see nothing

No eyes
No eyes on me
No eyes on me
Near me

[Bridge]
Can you see me lying?
Can you see why I contained?
Can you feel me thinking?
Would you save me if I fail?
I would love to love you
I would love to be your man
But the loneliness, please leave me

[Chorus]
No eyes
No eyes (no eyes)
No eyes
No eyes on me

[Post-Chorus]
So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many men
So many maybes
So many ways
So many ladies
So many menEmbed No Eyes - Radio Edit No Eyes Claptone;JAW techno
