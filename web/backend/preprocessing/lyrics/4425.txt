9 ContributorsLove Will Keep Us Alive Lyrics[Chorus]
I was standing, all alone against the world outside
You were searching for a place to hide
Lost and lonely, now you've given me the will to survive
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive

[Verse]
Don't you worry
Sometimes you've just got to let it ride
The world is changing
Right before your eyes

[Refrain]
Now I've found you
There's no more emptiness inside
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive

[Bridge]
I would die for you
Climb the highest mountain
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do

[Refrain]
Now I've found you
There's no more emptiness inside
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive
