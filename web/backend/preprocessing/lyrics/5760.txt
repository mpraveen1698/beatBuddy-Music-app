Let's go out and be wild, do it while we can
Do, do
Runnin' free in the world, we got all weekend
Do, do

[Pre-Chorus]
Tear it up, tear it down
Gettin' lost in the sound of our hearts beatin'
Take me here, take me now
Gettin' lost in a crowd with you

[Chorus]
Up all night
I waited for you all my life
Hold my hand and keep me close
I'll never let you go
No, not tonight
Keep me by your side

[Build]
Keep me by your side
Keep me by your

[Drop]
Side, by-by your side
By-by your side, by-by your side
Side, by-by your side
By-by your side, by-by
Keep me by your
Side, by-by your side
By-by your side, by-by your side
Side, by-by your side
By-by your side, by-by
Keep me by your side

'Cause I'm frozen in time when you're next to me
Do, do
