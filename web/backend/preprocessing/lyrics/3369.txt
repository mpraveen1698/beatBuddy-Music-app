You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You walk into a room
And people fall for you
How I wanna be like you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, it's true
I'm gonna be like you

[Verse 1]
Everybody laughs at all the things you say
It makes me wanna cry whenever you're away
The way you drive a car with all the windows down
They always say your name even when you're not around

[Pre-Chorus]
Seasons only change
It's always been the same

[Chorus]
You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You walk into a room
And people fall for you
How I wanna be like you

I will be your fool, I come back evеry time
You always tell the truth even when you lie
I watch you from afar, you show me what to do
And all the games you play, now I play all of them too

[Pre-Chorus]
Seasons only change
It's always been the same

[Chorus]
You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You walk into a room
