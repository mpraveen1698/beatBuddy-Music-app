Oh, won’t you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride if you can keep a secret
Oh, won’t you stay for a while?
Show me darkness baby, show me deepness
Oh, won’t you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride if you can keep a secret
Oh, won’t you stay for a while?
Show me darkness baby, show me deepness

[Half-Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride if you can keep a secret

[Bridge]
Stay a while, stay a while
And I will make it worth your while, worth your while
Stay a while, stay a while
And I'mma go the extra mile, extra mile
Boy, if you wait until the lights go down
I got some tricks that help you scream it out
So stay a while, stay a while
And I'mma make it worth your while, worth your while
(Oh, won’t you stay for a while?)

(Oh, won’t you stay for a while, for a while?)
(Oh, won’t you stay for a while?)
(Oh, won’t you stay for a while, for a while?)
