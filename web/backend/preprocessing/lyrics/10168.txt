10 ContributorsUnder (Radio Version) Lyrics[Chorus]
Don’t bury me
Don’t let me down
Don’t say it’s over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don’t say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under

[Verse 1]
I die every time you walk away
Don't leave me alone with me
See, I'm afraid
Of the darkness and my demons and the voices
Saying nothing's going to be okay
I feel it in my heart, soul, mind
That I'm losing you, me
You're abusing
Every reason that I've left to live

[Chorus]
Don't bury me
Don't let me down
Don't say it's over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under
Under, under
You might also like[Verse 2]
Lost trust, 21 grams of soul
All the sanity I've ever owned, gone
But I'm still breathing
Through the thunder and the fire and the madness
Just to let you shoot me down again
But I'm still breathing!
I feel it in my veins, skin, bones
That I'm losing you, me
You're confusing
Every reason I have left to live

[Chorus]
Don't bury me
Don't let me down
Don't say it's over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under
Under, under

[Bridge]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Ye-ah-ah-ah
Chasing you but you don't look back
Words are through that I can't take back
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you, no
Chasing you but you don't look back
Words are through that I can't take back
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you
[Chorus]
Don't bury me
Don't let me down
Don't say it's over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under
Under, under

Oh, only you can send me under
Yeah
