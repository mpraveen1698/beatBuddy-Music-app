Rumbling, rumbling
It's coming
Rumbling, rumbling
Beware
Coming for you

[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted to do was do right things
I never wanted to be the king, I swear
All I ever wanted to do was save your life
I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear (Swear)

[Pre-Chorus]
(I'm) Tearless, (I'm) Fearless
(I'm) Burning, (I'm) Burning
You tell me what have I missed?
Still wandering in the deep mist

[Chorus]
If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to diе another day
I don't want anything
I'm just here to
Bеware

All I ever wanted to do was know what's out there
I refused to lose without a fight, oh yeah (Woah-oh)
We're just too young, ignorant and innocent
Like kids stay up all night in a tent, oh yeah
How do you see me? (Oh yeah)
Am I who I used to be?
Beware

[Bridge]
Nobody knows what's inside of me
Nobody knows what's inside of me
Nobody knows what's inside of me, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
If I lose it all, slip and fall
Will you laugh at me?
If I lose it all, lose it all, ah

[Chorus]
If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to die another day
I don't want anything
I'm just here to
[Outro]
Beware
(Rumbling, rumbling
