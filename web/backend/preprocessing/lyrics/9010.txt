I still remember you, the way I dreamed of you
The way I hope that you imagined I'd be
Long before we came to realize the hard truth
Things aren't always what you want them to be
It's not a secret now, we couldn't work it out
We didn't want to know how hard it could be
So I'll keep clinging to the real you I knew
Before you ever met me

[Chorus: The Yarra Voices Choir & MGMT]
And now the stars are rearranging, my love
(I still remember you)
And all our souls are intеrchanging, my love
(I still remembеr you)
And now the stars are rearranging, my love
(I still remember)
And all our souls are interchanging, my love

[Verse 2: MGMT]
I'll take a chance this time, and reset all the lies
We'll keep the fire burning long as can be
Maybe I'll become the person you wished I was
Before you ever met me

[Chorus: The Yarra Voices Choir & MGMT]
And now the stars are rearranging, my love
And all our souls are interchanging, my love
(I still remember you)
And now the stars are rearranging, my love
(I still remember you)You might also like2Embed The Divine Chord We Will Always Love You The Avalanches;MGMT;Johnny Marr psych-rock
