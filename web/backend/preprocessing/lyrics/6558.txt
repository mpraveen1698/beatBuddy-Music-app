1 ContributorSonic Pt. 2 Lyrics[Refrain: Eddy]
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running home, ay
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running home
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running home
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running home, ay

[Verse 1: Eddy]
Feel the sweat, moving down
Feel like sonic cus I'm travelling at the speed of sound
Didn't think for a moment that we would be found
I gotta pack my bags up, and take the long way around
The world is your oyster, act all tough and boisterous
Til your mother's startled voice stirred
So i end up in streets full of moisture
Running round town away from you cus you disappoint her
Tripping over sightseeing the sceneries
And wondering when this gon end, too much mystery
The recipe for disaster, and yet i still find time to play 'penis capture'
So what's even the point anyway?
Should i be running away from the hedonism
I'm talking about being gay
Guess ill figure that out later
I see this sexy motherfucker that looks like he's a playa', uh

[Chorus: Eddy]
Fucking around with the guys every night, erection inspirin'
My ass, yea he mirin'
Fuck a pussy, we sword-fight, its tirin'
Twelfth night, devourin'
The cock ring be shinin'
If you see me with no pants, you know what to do
Hit it raw, no remorse, you don't need no-o clues
Fucking around with the guys every night, erection inspirin'
My ass, yea he mirin'

Fuckin' round, every night and every day (ayy)
Bro is straight but i catch feelings anyway (yuh)
I'm gonn take him back to class
Except he don't wanna fuck my ass
He said he just tryna ride the waves
Tidal waves, ass unsaved, but he don't wanna wait
Brudda playing games as if he at an arcade
Think his motion is far too archaic
Time to put this shit in overdrive like Jojo in part 8 (eight)

[Verse 3: tv]
You don't see me on a beat everyday
But my rhymes leave the boys blushing cus they gay
Make my cheeks red but you'll never catch me slippin'
Eating up his ass but his mouth is where I'm shittin'
Best boy band since Brock-and-hampton
They way I lick his dick gonn leave him spazzing
My rizz is impeccable call me Yew Loong Ding
When a girl sends a text I ignore her ping!

[Chorus: Eddy]
Fucking around with the guys every night, erection inspirin'
My ass, yea he mirin'
Fuck a pussy, we sword-fight, its tirin'
Twelfth night, devourin'
The cock ring be shinin'
If you see me with no pants, you know what to do
Hit it raw, no remorse, you don't need no-o clues
Fucking around with the guys every night, erection inspirin'
My ass, yea he mirin'
[Refrain: Eddy]
(humming)
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running home
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running home
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running home
Fucking around with the guys every night, erection inspirin'
My ass, yea he mirin'
Fucking around with the guys every night, erection inspirin'
My ass, yea he mirin', uh, yuh

[Verse 4: Eddy]
Hide in shade
Hiding away
Night and day
Disobey
God today
Cus im still tryna lead this boy astray
Different case
He wan stay
Ass buffet
When he lay
He just wan fuck on the display
He just wan fuck in the cafe
He just want that non stop ass clapping
Gun pop ass-assin, cumshot back blastin
So when i go boom boom bombastic
Vroom vroom, car dashing
Kanye west type spazzin'
The fuck am I doing bro?Embed Tirana Wolves On the Davenport Wolves Club sleep
