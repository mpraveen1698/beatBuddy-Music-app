23 Contributorsâ€‹just friends Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus]
There's something missing from my bed
Staring at the ceiling can't remember what I said
Let me whisper in your ear
I'm sitting here alone, but I wish that you were here
I'm feeling like I messed up and I'm sorry
I look up and my vision's getting starry
Wrapped up in my head
Think back all the time about the things I never said

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
There's something missing from my bed
Staring at the ceiling can't remember what I said
Let me whisper in your ear
I'm sitting here alone, but I wish that you were here
I'm feeling like I messed up and I'm sorry
I look up and my vision's getting starry
Wrapped up in my head
Think back all the time about the things I never said
