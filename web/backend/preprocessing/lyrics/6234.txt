An eagle breaks the silence
And overflies the field
My eyes will try to follow
'Till it vanishes away
Like candles in the darkness
We fight against the wind
Devotion to your idols
Soon will overthrow the king

[Piano and Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Out of order
Taming borders
Tearing down the fences
On and on and after all
The century has gone
Racism jumble
Turbulence
My eyes believe we have gone to the end

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ordinary Earth)
Ordinary Earth
Sailing through the space

Population alienation
Losing all affection
Calling on to heaven's hope
To watch for my protection
Out of luck
Potential stuck
Remote controlled
By the T.V. again

[Pre-Chorus]
Carries human souls (Carries human souls)
Lead us to the journey of our fate

[Chorus]
So come (So come) millennium sun (Millennium sun)
Won't you show us the way (Show us the way)
Future's begun
So words from my mouth come (My mouth come)
Whispering for your return

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Pictures a sunset on the lake
Mirrors of crystal your portrait
Walking on this field while I wait
[Chorus]
So come (So come) millennium sun (Millennium sun)
Won't you show us the way (Show us the way)
Future's begun
So words come from my mouth (Come from my mouth)
Whispering for your return
Show us the future's began
Burning millennium sunEmbed Affection Affection Calming Eyes sleep
