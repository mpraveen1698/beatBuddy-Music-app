4 ContributorsEverything Eventually Ends Lyrics[Verse 1: Rejjie Snow]
Peace to the world, peace to the kids
We all gotta hurt, we all gotta suffer
We all got a heart that bleeds on each other
We all had a mother, a sister, a brother
Alhamdulillah, you worshipin' the gossip
You never fought back, your conquerin’ your color
The scars on your back conceived by the woman
A star, you the brightest
Glorified death, crucified Christ
Sleepy giant gon' rest
Blonde hair, blue eyed, version ain't shit
Meditate backwards, church bells ring, worldwide hymns
Footsteps, Ethiopian, old hunched back
Lookеd back, Bible in his hands, dodged punch as
Assumptions, seekin’ to expand onе's conscious
Conquests, tribal, humans, nonsense
Cosmic, uterus, birthed me, awesome
Comics, aliens, flyin' saucers
Sufferin', solace, praisin' me, content
Judas, Deborah, scripted, prophets

[Bridge 1: Rejjie Snow]
One phone tap
Hatred for a soul I ain't never seen laugh
Carved out my features with the simplest of math
E equals everything eventually ends
Everyone's dead

Why do you look at me this way? (Mm-hmm)
What role am I supposed to play?

[Chorus: Flore Benguigui]
Never on the list at the party
Never quite as cool as you want me
But I don't need a friend, I got plenty
That your eyes can’t see
Always all alone, never lonely
Got my inner life and it’s sunny
I've a million arms there to hold me
That your eyes can’t see

[Verse 2: Rejjie Snow]
Light one in the air
R.I.P my dawgs, findin' strength in despair
Loose change, we paved, swimmin' through the tears
Fightin' through fallacies, scribblin’ my notes
Back to my salary, money don't fold, brushin' my fro
One man's trash be the other man's gold
Zoom through with the Ray-Bans on static
Hip-Hop's answer to the magic

[Bridge 2: Rejjie Snow]
Jingle bells rang
Santa Clause hoed down snow on demand
Kiss, kiss, wet lips, throwin' these hands
Cook 'em like holidays, Billy boy Bragg
I thought I was a man
[Pre-Chorus: Flore Benguigui]
Why do you look at me this way? (Mm-hmm)
What role am I supposed to play?

[Chorus: Flore Benguigui]
Never on the list at the party
Never quite as cool as you want me
But I don't need a friend, I got plenty
That your eyes can't see
Always all alone, never lonely
Got my inner life and it's sunny
I've a million arms there to hold me
That your eyes can't seeEmbed Everything Eventually Ends Everything Eventually Ends L'Impératrice;Rejjie Snow french
