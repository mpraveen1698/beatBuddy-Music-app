I don't know you
But I want you
All the more for that
Words fall through me
And always fool me
And I can't react

[Pre-Chorus]
And games that never amount
To more than they're meant
Will play themselves out

[Chorus]
Take this sinking boat
And point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice
You have a choice
You'll make it now

[Verse 2]
Falling slowly
Eyes that know me
And I can't go back
And moods that take me
And erase me
And I'm painted black
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won

[Chorus]
Take this sinking boat
And point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice
You have a choice
You've made it now
Falling slowly
Sing your melody
I'll sing along

[Outro]
Take it all
I played the cards too late
Now you're goneEmbed Falling Slowly Music From The Motion Picture Once Glen Hansard;Markéta Irglová singer-songwriter
