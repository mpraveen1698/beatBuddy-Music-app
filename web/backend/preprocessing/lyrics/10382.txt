20 ContributorsHypnotized Lyrics[Verse 1]
Feel buried alive, this city is airtight
Suffocated and lonely in the crowds
I'm surrounded by all the screens of their lies
Screamin' into space to drown them out

[Pre-Chorus]
I fell down so low, found nowhere to go
But I know you wait for me, you wait for me
So far out of sight, sucked into the white
But I know you wait for me

[Chorus]
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' back down tonight
'Cause I've been hypnotized by the lights
But I'm comin' home, I'm comin' back down tonight
Yeah, it's taken time to realize
But I'm comin' home, I'm comin' back down tonight

[Verse 2]
So hold me tight, I just wanna fade out
Somewhere we can shut the world away
I'm ready to hide, far from the fallout
They won't find us in the paradise we'll make

[Pre-Chorus]
I fell down so low, found nowhere to go
But I know you wait for me, you wait for me
So far out of sight, sucked into the white
But I know you wait for me
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I've been hypnotized by the lights
But I'm comin' home, I'm comin' back down tonight
Yeah, it's taken time to realize
But I'm comin' home, I'm comin' back down tonight

[Post-Chorus]
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' back down tonight
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' back down tonight

[Bridge]
Free-fallin' from the high
I'm followin' the voice I know
Free-fallin' from the high

[Chorus]
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' back down tonight
'Cause I've been hypnotized by the lights
But I'm comin' home, I'm comin' back down tonight
Yeah, it's taken time to realize
But I'm comin' home, I'm comin' back down tonight

[Post-Chorus]
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' back down tonight
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' back down tonight3Embed Hypnotized Exotica Purple Disco Machine;Sophie and the Giants deep-house
