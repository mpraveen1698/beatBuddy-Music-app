15 ContributorsPaper Thin Lyrics[Verse 1]
Paper-thin
God only knows the pain you're in
But the future's bright
You've got God on your side, He's listening
Love yourself
Or else you can't love no one else
I know your pain is real
But you won't let it heal

[Verse 2]
Paper-thin
If you're trying to lose, you'll never win
It's your life
But you're not the only one suffering
That's enough, I know you're made of better stuff
Baby, you gotta roam free
Please don't forget about me

[Chorus]
Oh, give me the other key
Oh, your heart's wide open
There must be another key
Left your heart wide open
Just give me the other key
Your heart is an open door
So let me love you
I just wanna love you

Paper-thin
You understand the pain I'm in
Slippin' in and out of such confidence
And overwhelming doubt
But if I love myself
I know I can't be no one else
Oh, no, don't go
'Cause I need you so

[Chorus]
Oh, give me the other key
Oh, your heart's wide open
There must be another key
Left your heart wide open
Just give me the other key
Your heart is an open door
So let me love you
I just wanna love you

[Bridge]
They said they're scared of you
I'm like, "Me, too, me, too"
("Me, too, me, too") "Me, too"
You say you're scared of me
We both just want to be free
(Be free, be free) Be free, mm
[Chorus]
Oh, give me the other key
Oh, your heart's wide open
There must be another key
Left your heart wide open
Just give me the other key
Your heart is an open door
Let me love you

[Outro]
Your heart's wide open
Your heart's wide open (Just give me another key)
Your heart's wide open (Just give me another key)
Your heart's wide open
Just give me another key (Just give me another key)
Your heart is an open door
So let me love you
I just wanna love you10Embed Paper Thin Lianne La Havas Lianne La Havas british
