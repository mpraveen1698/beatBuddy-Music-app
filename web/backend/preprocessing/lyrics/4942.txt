I feel so unsure
As I take your hand
And lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
These guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Oh

[Verse 2]
Time can never mend
The careless whispers
Of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find!

I'm never gonna dance again
These guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Oh

[Bridge]
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we wanna say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay!

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
These guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Oh
