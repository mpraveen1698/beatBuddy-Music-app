Heart eater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Heart eater, try but you will not suffice
Heart eater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Heart eater, try but you will not suffice

[Bridge]
Ooh, you're poison
Poison, filled with poison
Fill my veins with poison
Poison, filled with poison

[Chorus]
Heart eater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Heart eater, try but you will not suffice
Heart eater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Heart eater, try but you will not sufficeYou might also like102Embed HEARTEATER Bad Vibes Forever XXXTENTACION emo
