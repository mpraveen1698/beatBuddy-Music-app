Get down, it's Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night
Get down, it's Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night

[Verse 1]
Saturday morning
Friday's at an end
Housework is calling me
But where to begin?
Kids are out of school
Trying to find a friend
Everybody's busy
Can't wait for the night to begin

[Pre-Chorus]
You work all week long
You work your fingers to the bone
Friday's at an end
I can't wait for Saturday to begin

[Chorus]
I'm thinking (It's Saturday night)
I'm gonna have myself some fun fun fun (Saturday night)
