Where it began
I can't begin to know when
But then I know it's growin' strong
Was in the spring
And spring became the summer
Who'd have believed you'd come along?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hands, touchin' hands
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

[Chorus]
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
But now Iâ€¦

[Verse 2]
Look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holdin' you?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
One, touchin' one
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

[Chorus]
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
Oh no, no

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
Sweet Caroline
I believe they never could
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good31Embed Sweet Caroline Sweet Caroline Neil Diamond singer-songwriter
