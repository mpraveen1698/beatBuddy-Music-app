All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in LA
California dreamin' on such a winter's day

[Drop]
California
California
California

[Break]
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
If I didn't tell her
I could leave today
California

[Chorus]
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
If I didn't tell her
I could leave today
California dreamin' on such a winter's
California dreamin' on such a winter's
California dreamin' on such a winter's
California dreamin' on such a winter's day
