13 ContributorsGlad You Exist Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here's to all the late-night drunk phone calls that you picked up
Here's to all the bad decisions that you didn't judge
All the love you's and the hate you's and the secrets that you told me
Here's to everyone but mostly us

[Chorus]
There's a couple billion people in the world
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause еvery high and every low lеd to this
I'm just so glad you exist
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Hey look what a hello from a stranger turned into
Caught up in a moment like it's just us in this room
All the right words at the right time
And you know 'em 'cause you know me better than anyone else
We don't need anyone else

[Chorus]
There's a couple billion people in the world (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause every high and every low led to this
I'm just so glad you exist
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
There's a couple billion people in the world (In the world, yeah-yeah-yeah)
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
