2 ContributorsLosing Interest (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty]
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

[Chorus: Stract & Shiloh Dynasty]
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

[Verse 1: Stract]
Something doesn't feel right
Circumstances got me broken, prone to feel like
My whole life is a lie
And I'm looking for a way to get better
But lately my entire world's become gray and the weather
Been cold as ever, that's my real ice
I realize real lies in my real life
Even real eyes can't fathom that they
Wanna see me living life better
But then they never wanna
Ever see me living life better than them
And I'm a friend to them
What is a friend to them
If all my friends be enemies and I'm dead to them?
When will it end?
My days spent on defending my feelings
Showing no emotion, pretending that I'm feeling
Fine but I'm reminded my time is what I'm seeking
I'm like a light beaming at night when I fight demons
It's out of sight, seeming like I cannot quite reach it
'Til I find a peace of mind and I'm giving my life meaning

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

[Verse 2: Burgettii]
Aye, let me hit that shit real quick
Yeah
Romanticizing fantasies
Fantasizing these strategies
Actually get you back with me
Saddening just imagining
Actually happening, I'm staggering
I'm like a cavity blackening
Product of practicing rhymes
Rhyming a masterpiece, and naming it after you
So you would come after me
Climbing a mine trying, applying my time crying
And sighing, 'cause I ain't did this for nothing
But you ain't see how I'm feeling
On God though, I ain't bluffing
I be huffing and puffing
Just abusing a substance
'Cause of you I mean nothing
But how the fuck I mean nothing?
I mean I gotta mean something
But in the end, then it's nothing
These hands of mine be tied behind me declining to pry free
I'm likely to OD, I'm tired of the old me
Pray to God don't get cold feet
All I wanted was amnesty
Come to find out it ain't for me
All these demons have aimed for me
Pay to play, today'll be the fucking day that you pray for me
[Chorus: Stract & Shiloh Dynasty]
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

[Verse 3: Stract]
Yeah, yeah
Let me get one more
I'm running in a race from all these faces
I'm breaking down when I face them
Misplaced in all the hatred, I basically can't escape them
They been faking it to make it
Maintaining it but I'm aching
Awaken for the sake of the game life is making me play right
Can't save it 'til daylight, I'm waiting
This my way of changing my fate, I just pray 'cause I know
It's already written, destiny's already given
Not controlling life, just living
This the vision I'm fulfilling
On a mission 'til I'm winning
Gotta work with what I'm given
Make it worth it, never missing
I convert it to a living
I'm reversing all the pity
'Bout to hit a hundred fifty
Tryna make a difference quickly
Fight the hate, I'm tryna lift you
Gotta lift myself up with you
Plot to win before I drift to
Bottom of the barrel, stick to
What I'm taught, I will admit you
Might have shook me just a little
But my soul is never brittle
Never caught up in the middle
To the top before the whistle
Stract
[Chorus: Stract & Shiloh Dynasty]
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

[Outro: Stract & Shiloh Dynasty]
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
