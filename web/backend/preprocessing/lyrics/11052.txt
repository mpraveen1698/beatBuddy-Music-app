6 ContributorsGive Me Novacaine / She’s a Rebel Lyrics[Part I: Give Me Novacaine]

[Verse 1]
Take away the sensation inside
Bittersweet migraine in my head
It's like a throbbin’ toothache of the mind
I can't take this feelin' anymore

[Chorus]
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation’s overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine

[Verse 2]
Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feelin' and that's alright
Jimmy says it's better than here
I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything’ll be alright
Tell me that I won’t feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
Oh, Novacaine

[Chorus]
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything’ll be alright
Tell me, Jimmy, I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine

[Part II: She's a Rebel]

[Chorus]
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She’s the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

[Verse 1]
From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they call ol' Whatsername
She's a symbol of resistance
And she's holdin' on my heart like a hand grenade

[Verse 2]
Is she dreamin' what I'm thinkin'?
Is she the mother of all bombs? Gonna detonate
Is she trouble like I'm trouble?
Make it a double twist of fate or a melody that
[Bridge]
She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Well, nothin' comes to mind (Hey)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Well, nothin' comes to mind

[Chorus]
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction
[Outro]
She's a rebel, she's a rebel
She's a rebel and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, she's a rebel
She's a rebel and she's dangerous1Embed Give Me Novacaine / She's a Rebel American Idiot Green Day punk
