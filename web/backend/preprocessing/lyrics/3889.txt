I'm all by myself
Seen this show like a thousand times
It's a side effect
Loneliness without no reply
In my mind I just keep pretending
It's a big old lie, big old lie, big old lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the tables
City full of angels
Dreams of diamonds and gold
All the different faces
Ones I used to hate
I miss them now that they're gone

[Chorus]
Oh my god did we go too far?
Did we waste it all
Like we're running out of roses
Plastic cups did we laugh enough?
Looking back on us
Now that everything is over
Oh my god did we go too far?
Did we waste it all
Like we're running out of roses
Plastic cups did we laugh enough?
Looking back on us
Now that everything is over

On a night like this
All I know is what I should've said (ooh-ooh, ah)
In the life I've lived
All the things I wanna do again
When the silence ends
Swear I'll never let a day go by, day go by, day go by

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the tables
City full of angels
Dreams of diamonds and gold
All the different faces
Ones I used to hate
I miss them now that they're gone

[Chorus]
Oh my god did we go too far?
Did we waste it all
Like we're running out of roses?
Plastic cups did we laugh enough
Looking back on us
Now that everything is over?
Oh my god did we go too far?
Did we waste it all
Like we're running out of roses?
Plastic cups did we laugh enough
Looking back on us
Now that everything is over?Embed Running Out Of Roses Walker Racing League Alan Walker;Jamie Miller house
