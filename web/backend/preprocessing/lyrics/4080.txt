10 ContributorsLay All Your Love on Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it isn't true (But now it isn't true)
Now everything is new (Now everything is new)
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 2]
It was like shooting a sitting duck (Hm, hm)
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck (I was stuck)
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should nеver fall so easily (No, no, no)

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a kind of fear (I feel a kind of fеar)
When I don't have you near (When I don't have you near)
Unsatisfied (I-I-I), I skip my pride
I beg you, dear
