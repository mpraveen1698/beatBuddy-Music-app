What if I wanted to break?
Laugh it all off in your face
What would you do? (Whoa)
What if I fell to the floor?
Couldn't take this anymore
What would you do, do, do?

[Chorus]
Come break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you

[Verse 2]
What if I wanted to fight
Beg for the rest of my life
What would you do, do, do?
You say you wanted more
What are you waiting for?
I'm not running from you, from you

[Chorus]
Come break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you
Look in my eyes
You're killin' me, killin' me
All I wanted was you

I tried to be someone else, but nothin' seemed to change
I know now, this is who I really am inside
Finally found myself, fighting for a chance
I know now, this is who I really am
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Come break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you, you, you
Look in my eyes
You're killin' me, killin' me
All I wanted was you

[Outro]
Come break me down, break me down, break me down
(You say you wanted more) What if I wanted to break?
(What are you waiting for?)
(I'm not running from you) What if I, what if I, what if I, what if I
Bury me, bury me51Embed The Kill A Beautiful Lie Thirty Seconds To Mars grunge
