(I wish that I could hate you, my baby)

[Verse 1]
The colors are fading out
Is it quiet where you're sleeping?
Your records, my empty house
I wish I knew what you were feeling

[Pre-Chorus]
Fighting every instinct while you hold your pride
Back to the beginning, it swallows my mind
You're all that I think about
I even see you when I'm dreaming

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hate you, my baby
I wish that when I left, you'd've chased me
I didn't wanna change, but you made me
Now you're telling all your friends that I'm crazy
Hard to believe that you ever really loved me
I made-believe that you cared when you touched me
I know I'll be movin' on in slow motion

[Verse 2]
I've never been good with words
But you didn't try to listen
Could call, but I won't be the first
To remind you what you're missin'
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Fighting every instinct while you hold your pride
Back to the beginning, it swallows my mind
You never learned how to hurt
But I didn't try to fix it

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hate you, my baby
I wish that when I left, you'd've chased me
I didn't wanna change, but you made me
Now you're telling all your friends that I'm crazy
Hard to believe that you ever really loved me
I made-believe that you cared when you touched me
I know I'll be movin' on in slow motion

[Bridge]
(I wish that I could hate you, my baby)
I need you more when you are not around, not around
Maybe I crave the way you let me down, let me down
I think I want you more than I need ya
Avoid the places I see ya
Killing me slow, killing me slowly

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hate you, my baby
I wish that when I left, you'd've chased me
I didn't wanna change, but you made me
Now you're telling all your friends that I'm crazy
Hard to believe that you ever really loved me
I made-believe that you cared when you touched me
I know I'll be movin' on in slow motion1Embed Slow Motion Charlotte Charlotte Lawrence electro
