10 ContributorsEscape Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not invisible to you
Do my eyes, do my eyes
Speak true?
My soul so in touch with yours tonight
Won't let my head, let my head
Take flight

[Pre-Chorus]
We could leave this place
Freedom, ours to chase
What if I escape with you?

[Chorus]
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape?

[Verse 2]
Is it real, is it just a fantasy?
'Cause the unknown, the unknown's pulling me

[Pre-Chorus]
We could leave this place
Freedom, ours to chase
What if I escape with you?
You might also like[Chorus]
What if I escapе with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escapе with you?
What if I escape with you?

[Outro]
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?1Embed Escape (feat. Hayla) Escape (feat. Hayla) Kx5;deadmau5;Kaskade;Hayla edm
