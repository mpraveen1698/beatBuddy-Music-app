This is that new Anitta, suckers
Hmm, let's go

[Chorus: Anitta]
Kiss me from the roof to the lobby
Your lips on my body
They work like a hobby
Wanna see you kiss me from the roof to the lobby
Your lips on my body
Then talk till you've got me
Wanna see you

[Verse 1: Anitta & Missy Elliott]
Baby, I ain't tryna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I know that you know this (Woo)
Two sips in, you've gone straight to my head (Okay)
Lately, I've been on the way, way, way, way, way
I know that you know this (Know this)
Three nights in, you can't leave my bed

[Pre-Chorus: Anitta & Missy Elliott]
There's a golden door that leads to paradise, 'dise
I gave you all my keys, so let yourself inside, inside (Woo)

Kiss me from the roof to the lobby (Ayy)

They work like a hobby
Wanna see you kiss me from the roof to the lobby
Your lips on my body
Then talk till you've got me (Anitta)
