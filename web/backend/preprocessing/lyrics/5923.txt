Just don't let me go
Swear you'll keep me close
When I'm flying to the westside
When I catch another redeye
Just don't let me go
Swear you'll keep me close
When I'm flying to the westside
When I catch another redeye

[Verse 1]
You need to weigh your options
All you do is talk about
The dream or what you call it
Is it everything you wanted?
Is it big enough for the two of us?
What's a couple more, maybe two of us?
Am I big enough for the two of us?
Is it room enough, is it room еnough?

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't stop time, I tried to
It just goes past and I can't seem to catch it
No, I can't seem, no, I can't
And I can't slow down, I triеd to
I move too fast and I just end up crashin'
Na, na, na, na

Just don't let me go
Swear you'll keep me close
When I'm flying to the westside
When I catch another redeye
Just don't let me go
Swear you'll keep me close
When I'm flying to the westside
When I catch another redeye (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
So where the fuck you been?
And where you think you goin'?
Is leaving you a sin or not?
Am I better never knowing?
Where the fuck is home? Where the fuck I'm goin'?
Where the fuck my friends? Fuck I'm waiting for?
Think it's time to go, think it's time to call you
Think it's time to go, think it's time to call you

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't stop time, I tried to
It just goes past and I can't seem to catch it
No, I can't seem, no, I can't
And I can't slow down, I tried to
I move too fast and I just end up crashin'
Na, na, na, na
[Chorus]
Just don't let me go
Swear you'll keep me close
When I'm flying to the westside
When I catch another redeye
Just don't let me go
Swear you'll keep me close
When I'm flying to the westside
When I catch another redeye3Embed WESTSIDE GABRIEL keshi chill
