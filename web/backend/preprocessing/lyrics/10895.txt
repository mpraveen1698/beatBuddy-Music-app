3 ContributorsF.O.E Lyrics[Verse 1]
Didn't I risk it all, didn't I?
Like didn't I walk through that door
And tell em', "Hear my songs?"
Made 'em listen
Before I got through I turned my back on
More than just my demons
Love thy enemy 'cause
The one you think your friend might end up
Turnin' on you in the end
Then when you win
When you hit the switch

[Chorus]
They wanna get shit right back
How it was before you fucked it up
Ain't know I would level up
If you thought I was chosen
Why you chose up?
Now it's no heading back
They wanna get shit right back
How it was before you fucked it up
Ain't know I would levеl up
If you thought I was chosen
Why you chose up?
Now it's no heading back

All of my wondеrs
Fell in this blunt dust
Blew out all the fucks
Ever since I lucked up
Inside of them, entitlement
I'm so tired of bottlin' shit
Frustrating ('Stratin) niggas need to get checked
I sign off on my checks
Nigga, I don't make no threats
Don't need to set no record straight
All organic, my streams
And I ain't lose no deal
Price just went up to a mil' (Yeah, yeah)
NB the underdog of the underground
G.M. the don dada of the fuckin' sound
Mm-hmm, can you hear me now? (Check)
Time of the wolf is now...

[Chorus]
Right back
How it was before you fucked it up
Ain't know I would level up
If you thought I was chosen
Why you chose up?
Now it's no heading back
Right back
How it was before you fucked it up
Ain't know I would level up
If you thought I was chosen
Why you chose up?
Now it's no heading back
[Outro]
I gotta make it
Seek my vision
See right through me
They sleepin' on me
Tryna keep it
Keep my peace, yeah
F.O.E, yeah (Family over everything)
F.O.E., yeahEmbed F.O.E Tunnel Vision Nbdy chill
