I sleep all day, out all night
I know where you're goin'
I don't think that's a-actin' right
You don't think it's showin'

[Guitar Solo]

A-jumpin' up, fallin' down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Out all night, sleep all day
I know what you're doin'
If you're gonna a-act that way
I think there's trouble brewin'You might also like2Embed Funk #49 Rides Again James Gang british
