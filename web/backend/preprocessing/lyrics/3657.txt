31 ContributorsJoker & the Thief Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I said the joker is a wanted man
He makes his way all across the land
I see him siftin' through the sand
So I'll tell you all the story 'bout the joker and the thief in the night

[Verse 2]
He's always laughing in the midst of power
Always living in the final hour
There is always sweet in sour
So we are not goin' home

[Chorus]
Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday? I wonder what would happen if he took her away

[Verse 3]
What you see, well, you might not know
You get the feelin' comin' after the glow
The vagabond is a-moving slow
So I'll tell you all the story 'bout the joker and the thief in the night

[Verse 4]
All the people that you see in the night
Hold their dreams up to the light
The wilder beast is searching for sight
And we are not going home

A-can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday? I wonder what would happen if he took her away

[Outro]
I said the joker is a wanted man
Makes his way all across the land
See him sifting through the sand
So I'll tell you all the story 'bout the joker and the thief
I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the joker and the thief
I said, tell the story 'bout the joker and the thief in the night12Embed Joker And The Thief Wolfmother Wolfmother psych-rock
