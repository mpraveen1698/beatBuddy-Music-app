8 ContributorsTonight You Are Mine Lyrics[Verse 1]
In a sense I'm such a mess
Watching you
The air is cold, so hard to breathe
Still your breath is all I see
Reflect the sun
Light the one that I could never be
Thought I heard you call my name
Thought that I could take the blame
If you could have it all, why do you want me?

[Chorus]
So let me slip inside your ultraviolet disguise
The daylight holds you close
But tonight you are mine
Mine, mine

[Verse 2]
In a sense I'm nothing less
Than who you claim to be
But you're dressed in pixels clear as crystals
On my mind
Just one more time
If you could have it all, why do you want me?

[Chorus]
You might also like[Verse 3]
Don't be so naive
You know that you are all I see
And I cannot believe
The monopoly that bleeds
From your pores to the shores of the sea
