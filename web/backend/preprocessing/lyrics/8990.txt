Dreamcatcher on the rearview mirror
Hasn't caught a thing yet
Twenty dollars and a souvenir
Anything's worth trying

[Verse 2: Julien Baker]
To stay out of your nightmares
See, I was in your dream last night
Always end up dying
You said, because of course I did

[Chorus: Julien Baker]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
Always managed to move in
Right next to cemeteries
And never far from a hospital
I don't know what that tells you about me

[Verse 3: Lucy Dacus & Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus]
Pulling thorns out of my palm
Work a midnight surgery
When you cut a hole into my skull
Do you hate what you see like I do?
You might also like[Chorus: All]
