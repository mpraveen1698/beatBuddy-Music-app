Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding

[Verse 1: Jeris Johnson]
Don't give a fuck runnin' through my head
All these years wishin' I was dead
Took a walk outside, made a milli instead
Gotta see this through 'cause I can't say goodbye
I'm livin' on the edge, now I'm M.I.A
And if I come back, never be the same
Took a long time, now I'm so high
Don't believe me? Look in my eye

[Chorus: Jacoby Shaddix]
Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding

[Post-Chorus: Jacoby Shaddix, Jeris Johnson]
No, I don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort

[Verse 2: Jeris Johnson]
Cut my life in a million piеces
Walk through fire 'cause I'vе got no reason yet
Don't kill me now 'cause I'm bleeding
Drank Juggernog, now I'm healing
Back and forth, I wage a war inside, I
Toss and turn at night, it hurts, and then I
Break through, had to find myself
Took a last resort to fix this hell

'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight (Sight), losin' my mind (Mind)
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine (I'm fine)

[Bridge: Jacoby Shaddix, Jeris Johnson]
Nothing's alright (Right), nothing is fine (Fine)
I'm runnin' and I'm crying

[Pre-Chorus: Jeris Johnson]
Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding

[Chorus: Jacoby Shaddix, Jeris Johnson]
Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
(Losin' my sight, losin' my mind)
Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
(Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine)
Suffocation, no breathing
(Losin' my sight, losin' my mind)
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
(Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine)
[Outro: Jacoby Shaddix & Jeris Johnson]
