9 ContributorsTil I Hear It From You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I didn't ask, they shouldn't have told me
At first, I laughed, but now
It's sinking in fast whatever they've sold me
Well, baby

[Chorus]
I don't wanna take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you (Hear it from you)

[Verse 2]
It gets hard, the memory's faded
Who gets what they say?
It's likely they're just jealous and jaded
Well, maybe

[Chorus]
I don't wanna take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you (Hear it from you)
Until I hear it from you (Hear it from you)

[Bridge]
I can't let it get me off
Or break up my train of thought
As far as I know, nothing's wrong
Until I hear it from you

Still thinking about not living without it
Outside looking in
'Til we're talking about not stepping around it
Maybe

[Chorus]
I don't wanna take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you (Hear it from you)
Until I hear it from you (Hear it from you)
Until I hear it from you (Hear it from you)

[Outro]
'Til I hear it from you, oh, no
'Til I hear it from you, oh, no
'Til I hear it from you (Won't take advice from fools)
(I'll figure everything is cool)
'Til I hear it from you (Won't take advice from fools)
(I'll figure everything is cool)
