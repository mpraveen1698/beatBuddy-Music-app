4 ContributorsCall It Love Lyrics[Intro]
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?

[Verse 1]
Two hearts in a billion, one of all into you
Make me want to shout it out, like a hallelujah
'Cause time like these, times like these don't come and go
We're two hearts in a billion, singing hallelujah

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, there's something in the air tonight
Way up in the blades of gold
Hey, there's something in the air tonight
Say, I feel it in the sky above, and way down in the waves below
Hey, I feel it in the sky above

[Chorus]
Why don't we call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Why don't we call it love, call it love?

No sleep, running on a dream, down the golden coastline
You give me all I need, I'm like oh my oh-my
'Cause time like these, times like these don't come and go
No sleep, running on a dream, I'm like oh-my oh-my

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, there's something in the air tonight
Way up in the blades of gold
Hey, there's something in the air tonight
Say, I feel it in the sky above, and way down in the waves below
Hey, I feel it in the sky above

[Chorus]
Why don't we call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?Embed Call It Love Call It Love Felix Jaehn;Ray Dalton house
