She know, she know, she know (Ta-da, ta-da-da)
She know mi treat her better than her man (Woah)
But she a worry 'bout the millions
The millions, the millions, girl
You love me for true
But certain things in life they say you waan fi do, hey
So you see mi need fi understand that
You are made for a money man, but

[Chorus]
If you can't love me now, don't love me later
When my later is much greater
It only proves that she love di paper, my paper
If you can't love me now, don't love me later
When my later is much greater
Cah mi nuh waan no impersonator for my paper, no

[Verse 1]
Girl, do you love mi or do you love him?
Who introduce you to kissin' and huggin'
And gentle rubbin', and sexy touchin'
Admit it, girl, and mi'll gi you di proppa lovin', ohh
The only ting is dat he rich pan mi
You shouldn't be because a money make a switch pon mi
'Cause if you leave, girl, don't badda come back (No, no, no)
Because mi heart won't offer you no other comfort, so
You might also like[Chorus]
If you can't love me now, don't love me later
When my later is much greater
It only proves that she love di paper, my paper
If you can't love me now, don't love me later
When my later is much greater
Cah mi nuh waan no impersonator for my paper, no

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know you wan stability
But dat don't mean seh you fi sell your soul for vanity, no
Bright lights, fast cars, a di city (Ayy)
And di fast lane mek yuh lose your sanity, but
Mi cyan believe yuh sell yourself so short
To get di money you will make man break apart, but
A gyal life make your choice because
Mi nah make yuh break mi heart, no

[Chorus]
If you can't love me now, don't love me later
When my later is much greater

[Bridge]
I don't want you to learn the hard way
So I'm taking you to lover's school
You want money just for party, girl
You take mi fi fool
Every piece of my heart I gave away
I gave it away to you
And I thought you'd understand, baby
But time's running out on you, 'cause

[Chorus]
If you can't love me now, don't love me later
When my later is much greater
It only proves that she love di paper, my paper
If you can't love me now, don't love me later
When my later is much greater
