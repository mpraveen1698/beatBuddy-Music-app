She wants to live in LA
Come put your ash in my tray
Once upon a funky crime
We were standing in the line
And now we're walkin' Melrose down to Vine
Well, I was askin' her to live on my farm
And she was tellin' me "No, not today"
I was tellin' her to do no harm
And she was tellin' me she could not stay
She'd rather live in LA
Down in Marina del Rey

[Pre-Chorus]
I love her, I need her
Can't stop until I feed her
I want her so badly
Hell no, my name ain't Bradley
I'd wash her and clean hеr
Please tell mе, have you seen her?
Outlast her, drive past her
Margarita gonna be my master

[Chorus]
Bella cries and that's alright, she's
Weepin' on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold her
Bella cries and that's alright, she's
Leakin' on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold

She wants to live in LA
Where every dog has her day
Flip flops in the toaster now
Scotch tape on this broken vow
And wow, it's time to live without my puppy's chow
I was askin' her to live in the sticks
And she was tellin' me there is no way
The cheeky monkey was an anarchist
And she was tellin' me she could not stay
She'd rather live in LA
Down in Marina del Rey

[Pre-Chorus]
I love her, I need her
Can't stop until I feed her
I want her so badly
Hell no, my name ain't Bradley

[Chorus]
Bella cries and that's alright, she's
Weepin' on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold her
Bella cries and that's alright, she's
Leakin' on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold…her
[Bridge]
Out on the country road, I sold my Forty
This comeback episode, hold on, shorty
Yes, Frank Sinatra knows the summer wind will blow
And skinny mornings drop below
Sold my Forty
To Northern Jordie
I'll tell you when I move to Hell and then I'll prove
The violin said "Oh woah, woah"
And now the moment, the one we notice
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
Bella cries and that's alright, she's
Weepin' on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold her
Bella cries and that's alright, she's
Leakin' on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold…Bella

[Outro]
Leakin' on my shoulder again, that's Bella
Bella, girl, is on my team now, Bella
Leakin' on my shoulder again, well, Bella3Embed Bella Return of the Dream Canteen Red Hot Chili Peppers metal
