1 ContributorFor My Boy Lyrics[Hook]
This one heres for my boy
Yeah Imma treat you like a king
I do what I do so you won't need anything
I can tell you about that feeling and the joy that you bring
Until the day I'm gone Imma give you everything

[Verse 1]
Now I must confess I was living in a mess
With my girl says she was pregs yeah really had me stressed
Never had an old man to teach me nonetheless
I'm not the perfect dad, but I'll try to do my best
Anything that you want son you know that im gonna go get it
You'll always be my number one, and don't you forget it?
I swear, it's always insane now my life has really changed
It was drill everyday now, I'm singing Cocomelon
This the best feeling when I'm coming home to you
That smile on your face always lights up the room
I love the way you laugh We're playing peek-a-boo
Or even that face when you're doing number two
This is true just for you there's nothing dad would of do
If it's clothes, if its food, you know daddys pulling through
Showing love to my son that's all I want to do
If you see the way i am now you know that its true

On the day that you came on the six of the eighth
5:30 in the morning, but I was wide awake
I had to pinch myself cause i thought it was fake
And now were here today, Imma always keep you safe
I really can't complain because its changing me for better
And when you're down at times, I'll show you how to get up
I got you forever and I'll tell you keep your head up
Whatever the weather know what would never ever let up
It gets me really excited now, I see that you're crawling
You always make a lot of noise feels like we're talking
I'm waiting for the day when I see you walking
Kingston, you're the one and for you I will go all in
