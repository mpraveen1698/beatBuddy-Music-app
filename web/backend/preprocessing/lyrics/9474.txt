8 ContributorsNeurotic Lyrics[Verse 1: Matt Walst]
I can't get down from this high, somebody check my vital signs
Cause I'm in trouble this time, I’m in trouble this time, I’m in trouble
I gotta run for my life before I’m buried alive, I don’t wanna die
Yeah I’m in trouble this time, I need a lifeline, I’m in trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Walst]
I'm barely breathing
I need some kind of healing

[Chorus: Matt Walst]
I'm feeling neurotic
But there's a little in all of us
Some say I'm neurotic
I'm addicted to all of it
I'm barely breathing
I need some kind of healing
I'm feeling neurotic

[Verse 2: Lukas Rossi]
On a one way trip, no way to get out of it
Am I dead or alive? It's such a fine line, such a fine line
(It's like the devil's inside)
It's like the devil's inside, it’s like the devil's inside

[Pre-Chorus: Lukas Rossi]
It's like the devil's keeping me from breathing
I need some kind of healing
You might also like[Chorus: Matt Walst & Lukas Rossi]
I'm feeling neurotic
But there's a little in all of us
Some say I'm neurotic
I'm addicted to all of it
I'm barely breathing
I need some kind of healing
I'm feeling neurotic

[Bridge: Matt Walst & Lukas Rossi]
And I swear I never saw it coming
I always thought I could keep outrunning my demons
I didn't believe them but they're catching up to me
I can't get down from this high, somebody check my vital signs

[Chorus: Matt Walst]
I'm feeling neurotic
But there's a little in all of us
(And I swear I never saw it coming)
Some say I'm neurotic
I'm addicted to all of it
(And I swear I never saw it coming)
I'm barely breathing
I need some kind of healing
Neurotic
[Outro: Lukas Rossi]
I think the devil's inside
I think the devil's inside
I think the devil's
(I'm barely breathing)
I think I'm losing my mind
It's such a fine line
It's such a fine line2Embed Neurotic (feat. Lukas Rossi) EXPLOSIONS Three Days Grace;Lukas Rossi grunge
