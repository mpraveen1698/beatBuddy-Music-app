For the love of my life
Everything I sacrifice
Just to make her my wife
Kiss me hot like fire
Never cold like ice
I'll pay any price
'Cause she's just that nice
Every line of my rhyme is dedicated to you
And I'll always be true, never will you be blue
You're the best of me, I'll love till I grow old
Worth more than gold 'cause You're My Heart, You're My Soul

You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever
Stay with you together

You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feeling that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That's the only thing I really know

My heart and soul!
You might also likeI can imagine I was stranded on an island with her
And not a soul in the world knew where we were
I visualize and hypnotize, lost in your fur
And I love you more than anything on this earth
Give up the fortune and fame, commence to living alone
Home alone, won't even answer the phone
But every breath I take make the truth unfold
Let the whole world behold you're my heart, you're my soul

You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever
Stay with you together

You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feeling that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That's the only thing I really knowEmbed You're My Heart, You're My Soul '98 Back For Good Modern Talking synth-pop
