25 ContributorsMountain Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Comin' down the mountain
One of many children
Everybody has their own opinion, everybody has their own opinion
Holdin' it back, it hurts so bad, jumped out of my flesh and I said
Cash in!

[Chorus]
Cash in now, honey
Cash in now
Cash in now, baby
Cash in now, honey
Cash in, Miss Smith
Cash in now, baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I was comin' down the mountain
I met a child, man, she had pin eyes
We had the same opinion, had the same opinion
She was holdin' it back, it hurt so bad, jumpin' out of my flesh and I said
You better cash in

[Chorus]
Cash in now, honey
Cash in now
Cash in now, baby, yeah!
Cash in now, honey
Cash in, Miss Smith
Cash in now, baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
