4 ContributorsNo Longer Slaves Lyrics[Verse 1]
You unravel, me with a melody
You surround me, with a song
Of deliverance, from my enemies
'Til all my fears, are gone

[Chorus]
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

[Verse 2]
From my mother's womb
You have chosen me
Your love has called, my name
I've been born again
Into Your family
Your blood flows through, my veins

[Chorus]
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
'Cause I am a child of God

You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me
So I could stand and sing
I am, a child, of God

[Outro]
You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me
So I could stand and sing
I am, a child, of God
I am, a child, of God
I am, a child, of God
I am, a child, of God ...Embed No Longer Slaves No Longer Slaves I AM THEY world-music
