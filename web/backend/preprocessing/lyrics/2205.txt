32 ContributorsHeadstrong Lyrics[Verse 1]
Circling your, circling your, circling your head
Contemplating everything you ever said
Now I see the truth, I got a doubt
A different motive in your eyes
And now I'm out, see you later

[Pre-Chorus]
I see your fantasy
You want to make it a reality paved in gold
See inside, inside of our heads, yeah
Well, now that's over
I see your motives inside
Decisions to hide

[Chorus]
Back off, I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong, we're headstrong
Back off, I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong
I can't give everything away
I won't give everything away

Conclusions manifest
Your first impression's got to be your very best
I see you're full of shit and that's alright
That's how you play, I guess you get through every night
Well, now that's over

[Pre-Chorus]
I see your fantasy
You want to make it a reality paved in gold
See inside, inside of our heads, yeah
Well, now that's over
I see your motives inside
Decisions to hide

[Chorus]
Back off, I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong, we're headstrong
Back off, I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong
Where you belong
(I can't give everything away)
This is not where you belong
(I won't give everything away)
[Bridge]
I know, I know all about
I know, I know all about
I know, I know all about
I know, I know all about
Your motives inside and your decision to hide

[Chorus]
Back off, I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong, we're headstrong
Back off, I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong
Where you belong
This is not where you belong
(I can't give everything away)
This is not where you belong
(I won't give everything away)
This is not where you belong39Embed Headstrong Trapt Trapt grunge
