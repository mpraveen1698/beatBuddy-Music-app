7 ContributorsI Was Born to Love You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You give me a sign
You give me a lift
You take me home when I've done my shift

You give me a loan
When I'm stone cold broke
Get me high, when I need a toke

[Chorus]
I was born to love
I was born to
I was born to love
I was born to

[Verse 2]
Times were tough
We made it through
We tasted the rough
So let's savor the smooth

All the time I was hurtin' you
Got to believe that I was hurtin' too

[Chorus]
I was born to love
I was born to
Born to love
I was born to
You might also like[Bridge]
You're the only one I can talk to
The only one I can really read
I know you give because you want to
Don't you think it's time you learn to let yourself receive?

[Verse 3]
Can make you smile
Can make you sing
Just wanna give back a little bit of what you give me

I could sing you a song
Play you a tune
I know it's just a little thing but it's something I can do

[Chorus]
I was born to love
I was born to
I was a-born to love
I was born to

[Outro]
I was born
To love you

I was born
To love youEmbed I Was Born To Love You MONOVISION Ray LaMontagne acoustic
