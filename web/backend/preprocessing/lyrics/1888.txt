7 ContributorsSynchronize Lyrics[Refrain]
Smoke in the sky got me feelin' so blue
Burnin' down the city while I'm here with you
Smoke in the sky and I'm holding you tight
Because

[Chorus]
I love the way we synchronize
We synchronize
Let the moment crystallize
Don't think twice

[Verse 1]
I just wanna simmer
Like the way you glimmer
Pretty fires all around
Tell me, are we dreamin'?
Dancin' on the ceilin'
I wanna keep you safe and sound

[Refrain]
And all the smoke in the sky got me feelin' so blue
Burnin' down thе city while I'm here with you
Smokе in the sky and I'm holding you tight
Because

[Verse 2]
Feel your skin on mine, forget about the time
Floatin' on a purple cloud
I don't mind, as long as you hold me in your arms
We ain't never comin' down

[Refrain]
And all the smoke in the sky got me feelin' so blue
Burnin' down the city while I'm here with you
Smoke in the sky and I'm holding you tight (Yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause I love the way we synchronize (I love the way we synchronize)
We synchronize (Let the moment crystallize)
Crystallize (I love the way we synchronize)
Don't think twice
I love the way we synchronize (I love the way we synchronize)
We synchronize (Let the moment crystallize)
Crystallize (I love the way we synchronize)
Don't think twice (Don't think twice)
