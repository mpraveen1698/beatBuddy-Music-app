13 ContributorsSeventeen Lyrics[Helen Marnie:]
They only want you when you're seventeen
When you're twenty-one
You're no fun
They take a Polaroid and let you go
Say they'll let you know
So come on

They only want you when you're seventeen
When you're twenty-one
You're no fun
They take a Polaroid and let you go
Say they'll let you know
So come on

They only want you when you're seventeen
When you're twenty-one
You're no fun
They take a Polaroid and let you go
Say they'll let you know
So come on

They only want you when you're seventeen
When you're twenty-one
You're no fun
They take a Polaroid and let you go
Say they'll let you know
So come on
