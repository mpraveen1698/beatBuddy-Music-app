Every time I'm with it alone
It picks me up
You just send me down
I can feel it rushing under my skin
You're a cage won't you let me in?
On my toes
Lock the door
Pretty face
Through the walls
Don't know if I'd be so sure again

[Chorus]
My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out

[Verse 2]
Every time I'm stuck in the ground
Spin me round, won't you spin me round
You're a void, a crack in the mirror
See me now, if you could see me now
You slipped through
The night
Then walked out
Skin tight
But you don't matter that much to me
No you don't matter that much to me

My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out
So turn the lights out
Just turn the lights out

My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out9Embed Lights Out How Did We Get So Dark? Royal Blood garage
