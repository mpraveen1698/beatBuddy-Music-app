I hate this town, it's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in? Two! Three! Four!

[Verse 1]
Remember when I tried
I never strayed too far from you
Forever by your side
No matter what I was going through

[Pre-Chorus]
But now, I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me
Guess I was always wrong

[Chorus]
I hate this town, it's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?

[Verse 2]
I hate this town
'Cause no one can understand
I just can't be tied down
Nothing comes between me and my plans

So now, I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me
Guess I was always wrong

[Chorus]
I hate this town, it's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?

[Post-Chorus]
And don't believe a word they're telling to you
Don't believe a word they're telling to you
They let me down
When will I find where I fit in? I hate this town

[Bridge]
My world cannot ever bring me down
Gave everything I had to turn it back around
'Cause our time's worth something
Bigger than both you and me
I can't live my life always backing down
I gotta do this right, then they can't make a sound
'Cause I'm not here for nothing
Least I can say I stand for something!
[Breakdown]
You and me, we stand for something!

[Chorus]
I hate this town, it's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?

[Post-Chorus]
And don't believe a word they're telling to you
Don't believe a word they're telling to you
They let me down
When will I find where I fit in? I hate this town

[Outro]
I hate this town, I hate this town
I hate this town, I hate this town...21Embed All Signs Point To Lauderdale What Separates Me From You A Day To Remember metalcore
