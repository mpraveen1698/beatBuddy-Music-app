3 ContributorsHot Summer Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
I toss and turn all summer long
The days go fast, they're nearly gone
You walk into the room, I just gotta know
Are you what I've been waitin' for?

[Chorus]
You make me wanna sin, I know you feel it too
I wanna spend a hot summer night with you
I want you skin-to-skin, I feel your every move
I wanna spend a hot summer night with you

[Build]
I wanna spend a hot summer night with you
I wanna spend a hot summer night with you

[Drop]
I wanna spend a hot summer night with you
I wanna spend a hot summer night with you

[Verse 2]
Your look is so mysterious
Like it's making up for wasted life
When the sun's going down it's the two of us
It is you that I've been waitin' for
You might also like[Chorus]
You make me wanna sin, I know you feel it too
I wanna spend a hot summer night with you
I want you skin-to-skin, I feel your every move
I wanna spend a hot summer night with you

[Build]
I wanna spend a hot summer night with you
I wanna spend a hot summer night with you

[Drop]
I wanna spend a hot summer night with you
I wanna spend a hot summer night with youEmbed Hot Summer Nights Hot Summer Nights Nicky Romero;W&W progressive-house
