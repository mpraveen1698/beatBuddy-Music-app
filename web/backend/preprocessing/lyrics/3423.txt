28 ContributorsLosing Intrest Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, Papi, uh

[Verse]
Uh, and you play too much and now I'm
Losing interest
You used to be on my wishlist
I tried to talk but you would just never listen
And girl I had a point but then you missed it
And while we talkin' again
Always lookin' at you when you walk in again
I know what you been sayin' when you talk to your friends
And I swear that you can take my legs
And I find myself crawling again to you
I would do anything for you
I would give anything for you
And even though you using me
I wouldn't want anyone using me but you
I know it's messed up, but I can't help myself it's so tough
And even though I tell myself it ain't worth it
I always end up thinkin' again about us
