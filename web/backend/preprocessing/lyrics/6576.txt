Mister
Your eyes are full of hesitation
Sure makes me wonder
If you know what you're looking for
Mm, baby
I wanna keep my reputation
I'm a sensation
You try me once, you'll beg for more

[Chorus]
Oh, yes, sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long
Yes, sir, I can boogie
If you stay, you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long

[Verse 2]
No, sir
I don't feel very much like talking
No, neither walking
You wanna know if I can dance
Yes, sir
Already told you in the first verse
And in the chorus
But I will give you one more chance
You might also like[Chorus]
Ah, yes, sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long
Yes, sir, I can boogie
If you stay, you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long
Yes, sir, I can boogie
If you stay, you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yes, sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
All night long
Yes, sir, I can boogie (I can boogie)
If you stay, you can't go wrong (Ah-ah)
I can boogie (I can boogie), boogie-woogie (Boogie-woogie)
All night long
Yes, sir, I can boogie (I can boogie)
If you stay, you can't go wrong (Ah-ah)
I can boogie (I can boogie), boogie-woogie (Oh)
All night long (All night long)
Yes, sir, I can boogie
If you stay, you can't go wrong
I can boogie, boogie-woogie
