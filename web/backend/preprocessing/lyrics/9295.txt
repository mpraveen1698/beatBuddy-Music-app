11 ContributorsChoke Lyrics[Intro: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Choke
Yeah

[Verse 1: Eric Vanlerberghe, Brian Burkheiser]
I ain't been here for a long time
But it's been a long time since you met somebody like me
I'm taking pleasure cuttin' all ties, on the path to all-time
I could do this shit in my sleep
Yeah, I'd love to see you come and try to fuck with my headspace
Better men than you have had a zero success rate
Consider the benefit then consider the death rate
Without me, there's no you in the first place

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe]
(One) One time for the ones who don't believe
(Two) Two times for the fake apologies
I know you always wanna run your mouth
Yeah, I figured you out

[Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe, Both]
Every time you say my fucking name
Nothing can save you
Bite your tongue, suffocate
Yeah, suffocate
It's time to face the mess you made
Reap what you sow
Every time you say my name
Choke
My hands on your throat

You're about to bear witness (Witness)
To a natural-born killer with a hit list (hit list)
I've been sent to erase your existence
So bow down, beg for forgiveness

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Eric Vanlerberghe]
(One) One time for the ones who don't believe
(Two) Two times for the fake apologies
I know you always wanna run your mouth
Yeah, I figured you out

[Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe, Both]
Every time you say my fucking name
Nothing can save you
Bite your tongue, suffocate
Yeah, suffocate
It's time to face the mess you made
Reap what you sow
Every time you say my name

[Bridge: Eric Vanlerberghe]
You think you're out of the woods now
You think you can hide from the truth
Hypocrites always get found out
I'm coming for you
Run
Break your fucking neck
With my hands on your throat
Look in my eyes
You've got nowhere to go
It's a matter of time
'Til I send you below
I'm not letting go
'Til you feel my grip strip you down to the bone
[Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe, Both]
Next time you say my fucking name
Bite your tongue, suffocate
Yeah, suffocate
It's time to face the mess you made
Reap what you sow
Every time you say my name
Choke
My hands on your throatEmbed Choke TRUE POWER I Prevail metalcore
