Well, it's all right
Riding around in the breeze
Well, it's all right
If you live the life you please
Well, it's all right
Doin' the best you can
Well, it's all right
As long as you lend a hand

[Verse 1: Tom Petty]
You can sit around and wait for the phone to ring
(The end of the line)
Waiting for someone to tell you everything
(The end of the line, of the line)
Sit around and wonder what tomorrow will bring
(The end of the line)
Maybe a diamond ring

[Chorus: Jeff Lynne]
Well, it's all right
Even if they say you're wrong
Well, it's all right
Sometimes, you gotta be strong
Well, it's all right
As long as you got somewhere to lay
Well, it's all right
Every day is judgement day
You might also like[Verse 2: Tom Petty]
Maybe somewhere down the road away
(The end of the line)
You'll think of me and wonder where I am these days
(The end of the line, of the line)
Maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays
(The end of the line)
Purple haze
[Chorus: Roy Orbison]
Well, it's all right
Even when push comes to shove
Well, it's all right
If you got someone to love
Well, it's all right
Everything'll work out fine
Well, it's all right
We're goin' to the end of the line

[Verse 3: Tom Petty]
Don't have to be ashamed of the car I drive
(The end of the line)
I'm just glad to be here, happy to be alive
(The end of the line, of the line)
It don't matter if you're by my side
(The end of the line)
I'm satisfied
Chorus: George Harrison, Jeff Lynne & [George Harrison]
Well, it's all right
Even if you're old and grey
Well, it's all right
You still got somethin' to say
Well, it's all right
Remember to live and let live
Well, it's all right
The best you can do is forgive
Well, it's all right (All right)
Ridin' around in the breeze
Well, it's all right
If you live the life you please
Well, it's all right
Even if the sun don't shine
Well, it's all right (All right)
We're goin' to the end of the line4Embed End Of The Line The Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1 Traveling Wilburys blues
