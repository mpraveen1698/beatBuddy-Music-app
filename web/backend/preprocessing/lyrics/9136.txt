Welcome to the house

[ALL]
To the Haus of Holbein
Ja, ooh ja, das ist gut
Ooh ja, ja
The Haus of Holbein

[CATHERINE PARR]
Hans Holbein goes around the world
[CATHERINE OF ARAGON]
Painting all of the beautiful girls

[JANE SEYMOUR]
From Spain

[KATHERINE HOWARD]
To France

[ANNA OF CLEVES]
And Germany

[KATHERINE HOWARD]
The king chooses one
You might also like[ALL]
But which one will it be?

[CATHERINE OF ARAGON & ANNE BOLEYN]
You bring the corsets

[JANE SEYMOUR & ANNA OF CLEVES]
We'll bring the cinches

[ANNA OF CLEVES]
No one wants a waist over nine inches

[ALL EXCEPT KATHERINE HOWARD]
So what, the makeup contains lead poison?

[KATHERINE HOWARD]
At least your complexion will bring all the boys in

[ALL]
Ignore the fear and you'll be fine
We'll turn this vier into a nine
So just say 'ja' and don't say 'nein'

[CATHERINE PARR]
'Cause now you're in the house
[ALL]
In the Haus of Holbein!
Ja, ooh ja, das ist gut
Ooh ja, ja
The Haus of Holbein

[ANNE BOLEYN]
We must make sure the princesses look great
When their time comes for the Holbein portrait

[ANNA OF CLEVES]
We know what all the best inventions are
To hold everything up

[ANNE BOLEYN]
Ja, it's wunderbar
[JANE SEYMOUR]
For blonder hair, then you just add a magical ingredient

[JANE SEYMOUR]
From your bladder
[CATHERINE PARR]
Try these heels, so high it's naughty
[ALL]
But we cannot guarantee that you'll still walk at forty
Ignore the fear and you'll be fine
We'll turn this vier into a nine
So just say 'ja' and don't say 'nein'

[CATHERINE PARR]
'Cause now you're in the house

[ALL]
In the Haus of Holbein!
Ooh ja, das ist gut
Ooh ja, ja
