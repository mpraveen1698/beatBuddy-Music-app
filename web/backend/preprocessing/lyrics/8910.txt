4 ContributorsEvermore Lyrics[Verse 1]
I felt it from the start
It grew inside my heart
It changed me from that day
This love I can't contain

[Verse 2]
I waited for a sign
So patient and divine
For fate was on our side
That day I came to find

[Chorus]
That you are all
I was hoping for
It's you I'll call
My evermore

[Verse 3]
The garden as our home
A place where we can grow
You're planted in my soul
To nurture and to hold

[Chorus]
'Cause you are all
I was hoping for
It's you I'll call
My evermore
