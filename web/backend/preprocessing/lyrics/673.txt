44 ContributorsHex Lyrics[Verse 1]
East and the west, I'm rackin' up all my bread, uh
Power on me, I'm feelin' just like a Tesla
Too much tree, the smoke is makin' my chest hurt
Girl on me, I'm thinking I should arrest her
Ayy, I'm thinking I should arrest
All night long she puttin' me to the test
Got a lot on, I'm tryna take off the rest
Cleaning up my lines, I say nothin' but the best

[Verse 2]
Hey girl, you're the cutest that I see
So bright I'm not using my visine
Gotta get it likely or I'm ending my life, see
So beautiful like outta my dreams
Hey boo, I'm hollering at you
Not rude, I'm just tryna be yo' dude
So what I gotta do just to see how that ass move?
So beautiful, sorry to be crude

[Verse 3]
Yo B, I'm makin' the next move
You know me, I'm nothing but just smooth
Low seats, I'm settin' the right mood
All these other rappers, they talking, they just food
Ayy, I'm talking to just you
You talking to one dude
You rockin' with one dude
And if I get it right, then I'll turn off the lights soon

Hey girl, you wanna be my world
Get showered with diamonds and some pearls?
Not trying to make you my night girl
I'ma treat you right like I'm a knight girl
Hey fam, I'm tryna be your man
Me talking to you is God's plan
No, I do not want a one night stand
Take you 'round the world, just grab on my right hand19Embed Hex Hex 80purppp chill
