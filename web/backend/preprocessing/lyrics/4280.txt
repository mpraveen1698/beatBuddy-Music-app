Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands

[Chorus]
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs, and he
Likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs, and he
Likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say, "Yeah"

[Verse 2]
We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom

[Chorus]
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs, and he
Likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs, and he
Likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say, "Yeah"

[Chorus]
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs, and he
Likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs, and he
Likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say, "Yeah"67Embed In Bloom Nevermind (Remastered) Nirvana alt-rock
