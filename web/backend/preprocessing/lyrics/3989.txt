32 ContributorsPride and Joy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, you've heard about lovin' givin' sight to the blind
My baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine

[Chorus]
She my sweet little thing
She my pride and joy
She my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I love my baby
My heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old

[Chorus]
She my sweet little thing
She my pride and joy
She my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I love my lady
She's long and lean
You mess with her
You'll see a man get mean
You might also like[Chorus]
She my sweet little thing
She my pride and joy
She my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy

Yeah, I love my baby
My heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old

She my sweet little thing
She my pride and joy
She my sweet little baby
