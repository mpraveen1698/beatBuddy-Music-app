Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

[Verse 1]
Another night I'm barely holdin' on
One step away from being dead and gone
Am I alive to die another day?
Is this life that I've been livin' all that's meant for me?

[Chorus]
Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up at the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

[Verse 2]
The higher I go, the harder I fall
So I don't look down, I don't look back at all
And when I wish it all would turn to black
I try to see the light and push the darkness back

Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up at the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', I keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

[Bridge]
So if I'm not already too far gone
And if I feel a pulse then I can carry on
When I'm lost and wanna fade away
I tell myself to live, to die another day

[Chorus]
Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up at the bottom of it all again
I'm still alive and keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain, the mountain9Embed The Mountain Outsider Three Days Grace grunge
