When you wake up
It's not the first thing that you wanna know
Can you still count
All of the reasons that you're not alone?
When you wake up
It's not the first thing that you wanna know
Can you still count
All of the reasons that you're not alone?

[Chorus]
No one wants to be the odd one out at times (No one wants to be, yeah)
No one wants to be the negro swan (The swan)
Can you break sometimes? (Sometimes)
Can you break sometimes? (Sometimes, ooh)
Charcoal make it start and make me liked at times (No one wants to be, yeah)
Lick me till it cleans all of the world
Can you break sometimes?
Can you break sometimes? (Yeah, sometimes)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you wake up
It's not the first thing that you wanna know
Can you still count
All of the reasons that you're not alone? (My friends)

Can you break sometimes? (Sometimes, oh)
Charcoal make it start and make me liked at times (No one wants to be, yeah)
Lick me till it cleans all of the world
Can you break sometimes? (Sometimes)
Can you break sometimes? (Sometimes)

Can she break sometimes?
No one, no one
Can you break sometimes?

Can she break sometimes?
No one, no, no one
