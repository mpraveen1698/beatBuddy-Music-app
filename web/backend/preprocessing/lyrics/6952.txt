Killing time, no place to go
Everybody's feeling low
All alone in the streetlight glow
You fall into your head

[Chorus]
It's all that you want
It's all that you need
Take some time to make believe
It's all that you want
It's all that you need
Just some time to make believe
It's all that you want

All that you want
Hey, la-di-da, ah
Hey, la-di-da, ah
It's all that you want
Ooh, ooh
