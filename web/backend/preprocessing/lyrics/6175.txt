12 ContributorsTell Me Iâ€™m a Wreck Lyrics[Verse 1]
I could have been easier on you
I could have been all you held onto
I know I wasn't fair, I tried my best to care about you
I know I could have been a better man
But I always had to have the upper hand
I'm struggling to see the better side of me
But I can't take all your jabs and taunts
You're pointing out my every fault
And you wonder why I walked away

[Chorus]
When you tell me I'm a wreck
You say that I'm a mess
How could you expect anything less?
You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along
I told you when you asked
I knew this wouldn't last
At least I could be honest about that
And now you're telling everyone
How I only did you wrong
I guess you never knew me at all

[Verse 2]
Remember on my 21st birthday
You took me where we went on our first date
We stayed till closing time, after 4 glasses of wine
You started with a pointless argument
You said that I forgot to compliment
The dress you wore that night
That I've seen a thousand times
But I think we just want different things
I want space, you want a diamond ring
Whatever made you think we were meant to be?

When you tell me I'm a wreck
You say that I'm a mess
How could you expect anything less?
You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along
I told you when you asked
I knew this wouldn't last
At least I could be honest about that
And now you're telling everyone
How I only did you wrong
I guess you never knew me at all

[Bridge]
You tell me I'm a wreck
You say that I'm a mess
How could you expect anything less

[Chorus]
When you tell me I'm a wreck
You say that I'm a mess
How could you expect anything less?
You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along
I told you when you asked
I knew this wouldn't last
At least I could be honest about that
And now you're telling everyone
How I only did you wrong
Still I see you standing there
Waiting 'round for me to fall
Girl you must be crazy
Still believing you and me belong
I guess you never knew me at all2Embed Tell Me I'm A Wreck Picture Perfect Every Avenue emo
