3 ContributorsAlive Lyrics[Verse 1]
There is a break in the light
There is a place I can hide
Where all the colours collide
And your flame, it keeps me alive
Might lose a part of my mind
Searching for what I can't find
Held by the dark of the night
And your flame, it keeps me alive

[Chorus]
And all I need is to be here by you
All I need is to be freed by you
Be freed by you
And your flame, it keeps me alive

[Post-Chorus]
Alive
Alive
Alive

[Chorus]
And all I need is to be here by you
All I need is to be freed by you
Be freed by you
And your flame, it keeps me alive

(For my life, for what’s right)
I'm gonna fight for my lifе (For my life)
Fighting the fight for what's right (For what’s right)
Held by the dark of the night
But your flame, it keeps me alive (Alive, alive, alive)

[Chorus]
And all I need is to be here by you
All I need is to be freed by you
Be freed by you
And your flame, it keeps me alive

And all I need is to be here by you
All I need is to be freed by you
Be freed by you
And your flame, it keeps me alive
