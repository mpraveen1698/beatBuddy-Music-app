4 ContributorsWhat Would I Do Without You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I wake up with a sadness
Other days, it feels like madness
Oh, what would I do without you?

When colors turn to shades of gray
With the weight of the world at the end of the day
Oh, what would I do without you?

[Chorus 1]
A decade goes by without a warning
And there's still a kindness in your eyes
Amidst the questions and the worry
A peace of mind always takes me by surprise

[Verse 2]
I feel like I'm walking with eyes as blind
As a man without a lantern in a coal mine
Oh, what would I do without you?

My imagination gets the best of me
And I'm trying to hide, lost at sea
Oh, what would I do without you?

[Chorus 2]
The difference between what I've said and done
And you're still standing by my side
A guilty soul and a worried mind
I will never make it, if I'm on my own
[Verse 3]
So you got the morning; I got midnight
You are patient; I'm always on time
Oh, what would I do without you?

You got your sunshine; I got rain clouds
You got hope; I got my doubts
Oh, what would I do without you?

[Ending]
Oh, what would I do without you?
Oh, what would I do without you?6Embed What Would I Do Without You Good Light Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors acoustic
