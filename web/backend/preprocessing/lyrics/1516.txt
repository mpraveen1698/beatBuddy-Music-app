26 ContributorsRight Down the Line Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know I need your love
You've got that hold over me
Long as I've got your love
You know that I'll never leave
When I wanted you to share my life
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you, woman
Right down the line

[Verse 2]
I know how much I lean on you
Only you can see
The changes that I've been through
Have left a mark on me
You've been as constant as a Northern Star
The brightest light that shines
It's been you, woman
Right down the line

[Chorus]
I just wanna say this is my way
Of telling you everything
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of telling you
That every day I'm loving you so much more
You might also like[Verse 3]
Cause you believed in me
Through my darkest night
Put something better inside of me
You brought me into the light
I threw away all those crazy dreams
I put them all behind
And it was you, woman
Right down the line

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I just wanna say this is my way
Of telling you everything
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of telling you
That every day I'm loving you so much more

[Verse 4]
If I should doubt myself
If I'm losing ground
I won't turn to someone else
They'd only let me down
When I wanted you to share my life
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you, woman
