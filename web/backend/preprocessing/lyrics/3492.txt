Ask me what I did with my life
I spent it with you
If I lose my fame and fortune
(Really don't matter)
As long as I got you, baby

[Chorus]
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
As long as I got you, baby
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
As long as I got you

[Verse]
Ask me what I did with my life
I spent it with you
If I lose my fame and fortune
(Really don't matter)
As long as I got you, baby

[Chorus]
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
As long as I got you, baby
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
As long as I got you

As the years they pass us by
Years they, years they, years they
We stay young through each other's eyes
Each other's eyes
And no matter how old we get
It's okay, as long as I got you, baby

Clap your hands y'all it's alright (As long as I got you, baby)
Clap your hands y'all it's alright (As long as I got you, baby)
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
As long as I got you, baby
Clap your hands y'all it's alright (As long as I got you, baby)
