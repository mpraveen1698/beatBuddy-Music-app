Oh, mama!

[Verse 1]
No stopping at the red light, girl
'Cause I want to get you said now
No going at the green light, girl
'Cause I want to be with you now
You are my special, you are my special
You are my midnight, midnight, yeah

[Chorus]
So sweet, so fine, so nice
Oh my, my-my, my-my, oh

[Verse 2]
No stopping on the highway, girl
'Cause I want to burn my gas
There's one girl that I know
I'm never gonna pass
She is my special, she is my special
She is my midnight, midnight, yeah

[Chorus]
So sweet, so fine, so nice
Oh my, my-my, my-my, oh
