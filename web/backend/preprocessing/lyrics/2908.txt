[Verse]
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night (Juicy)
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Those days are over
You don't have to put on the red light (Juicy)

[Chorus]
Those days are over
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to put on the red light

[Post-Chorus]
Those days are over
You don't have to put on the red light
Thosе days are over
You don't have to put on thе red lightYou might also like2Embed Redlight Paradise Again Swedish House Mafia;Sting progressive-house
