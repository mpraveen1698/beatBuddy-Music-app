I'm nearing the end of my fourth year
I feel like I've been lacking, crying too many tears
Everyone seemed to say it was so great
But did I miss out? Was it a huge mistake?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't help the fact I like to be alone
It might sound kinda sad, but that's just what I seem to know
I tend to handle things usually by myself
And I can't ever seem to try and ask for help

[Chorus]
I'm sitting here, crying in my prom dress
I'd be the prom queen if crying was a contest
Make-up is running down, feelings are all around
How did I get here? I need to know
I guess I maybe had a couple expectations
Thought I'd get to them, but no, I didn't
I guess I thought that prom was gonna be fun
But now I'm sitting on the floor and all I wanna do is run

[Verse 2]
I keep collections of masks upon my wall
To try and stop myself from revealing it all
Affecting others is the last thing I would do
I keep to myself though I want to break through
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I hold so many small regrets
And what-ifs down inside my head
Some confidence, it couldn't hurt me
My demeanor is often misread

[Chorus]
I'm sitting here, crying in my prom dress
I'd be the prom queen if crying was a contest
Make-up is running down, feelings are all around
How did I get here? I need to know
I guess I maybe had a couple expectations
Thought I'd get to them, but no, I didn't
I guess I thought that prom was gonna be fun
But now I'm sitting on the floor and all I wanna do is run

[Post-Chorus]
All I wanna do is run
All I wanna do is run
All I wanna do is run

[Chorus]
I'm sitting here, crying in my prom dress
I'd be the prom queen if crying was a contest
Make-up is running down, feelings are all around
How did I get here? I need to know
I guess I maybe had a couple expectations
Thought I'd get to them, but no, I didn't
I guess I thought that prom was gonna be fun
But now I'm sitting on the floor and all I wanna do is run
