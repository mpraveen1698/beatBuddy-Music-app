33 ContributorsJohn Wayne Lyrics[Verse 1]
He's got so much love for her
But he doesn't know what to do
Sitting in the car
Waiting outside her school

[Pre-Chorus]
He's in for a heartbreak
If it's all been blind faith
From my point of view

[Chorus]
Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world
Or chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy

[Verse 2]
He's got so much in his heart
But he doesn't know what to do
All he wants is her
Lying inside his room

[Pre-Chorus]
He's always feeling cheated,
Telling all his secrets
That I couldn't keep

Baby, he's got to be crazy
Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world
Or chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy11Embed John Wayne Cigarettes After Sex Cigarettes After Sex ambient
