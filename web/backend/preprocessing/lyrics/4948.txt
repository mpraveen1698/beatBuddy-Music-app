10 ContributorsFighter Lyrics[Verse 1]
Give me the lights, give me the hate, give me the pressure
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, pain is pleasure
I hear the wolves calling my name, no surrender
Here only the strong survive
Don't need to sign, nothing divine's gonna save me
I'm a machine, building a dream is what shaped me
Breaking the door, waging a war, no escaping
Watch me as I touch the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
The blood I tastе is the price I pay
All my scars will fade
Thе monsters in my head will become the prey

[Chorus]
I’m a fighter, cutthroat I’m a winner
Stone cold, my heart is the trigger
I’m a fighter, one shot heavy hitter
Can’t stop I’m a natural killer
I'm a fighter
(Woah, woah)
I'm a fighter
(Woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
I am a lion, fear is a lamb to the slaughter
Cut and I bleed, I don’t retreat, I ain’t a martyr
Killing the dark, I am the light growing stronger
Watch me as I come alive

The blood I taste is the price I pay
Every blow I take
Nothing ever hurts when you feel no pain

[Chorus]
I’m a fighter, cutthroat I’m a winner
Stone cold, my heart is the trigger
I’m a fighter, one shot heavy hitter
Can’t stop I’m a natural killer
I'm a fighter
(Woah, woah)
I'm a fighter
(Woah, woah)

[Bridge]
They say the world's gonna forsake me
The poison in my ears won't shake me
Feel my inhibitions fading
Risin' up, risin' up
They ain't gonna break me

[Chorus]
I’m a fighter, cutthroat I’m a winner
Stone cold, my heart is the trigger
I’m a fighter, one shot heavy hitter
Can’t stop I’m a natural killer
I'm a fighter
(Woah, woah)
I'm a fighter
