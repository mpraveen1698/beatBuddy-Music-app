11 Contributorsâ€‹chance with you Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I've heard all about you
All those things they had to say
You're a legend 'round this school
Locally famous drama queen
Turn my eyes, I see you stare
Cross the room and right at me
Now you're smiling like you've got
Like you've got something on your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so beautiful
I don't want to turn away
You've been here before
Make me feel like you're a
Wild animal
Shaking, I am your prey
I'm all you want

[Chorus]
If I could go back in time
I'd shoot my shot
I'd risk it all
If I could go back in time
I'd shoot my shot
Just so I could have a chance
With you
With you
You might also like[Verse 2]
You are always on my mind
Sitting here, I am waiting
Ones like you, they make me shy
Innocently intimidating
I still can't figure you out
You're the kind that drives me mad
Are you here looking for love
Or do you love being looked at?

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so beautiful
I don't want to turn away
You've been here before
Make me feel like I'm a
Wild animal
Shaking, you are my prey
You're all I want

[Chorus]
If I could go back in time
I'd shoot my shot
I'd risk it all
If I could go back in time
I'd shoot my shot
Just so I could have a chance
With you
With you
[Outro]
