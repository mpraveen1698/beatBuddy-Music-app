5 ContributorsHeartbroken, In Disrepair Lyrics[Verse 1]
There is no light, there is no charm (Charm)
All my belongings, I hold with one arm (Arm)
Under the bridge, asleep in the shade (Shade)
All of the terrible choices that I made

[Chorus]
Searching for light, gasping for air (Air)
Heartbroken, in disrepair (Oh)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
God may forgive me, but that's not enough (Enough)
'Cause I gotta live with myself, 'till I'm dust (Dust)
Just walk on by, if we pass on the street (Street)
Sometimes in battle, it's best to retreat

[Chorus]
Searching for light, gasping for air (Air)
Heartbroken, in disrepair (Oh)You might also like1Embed Heartbroken, In Disrepair Keep It Hid Dan Auerbach garage
