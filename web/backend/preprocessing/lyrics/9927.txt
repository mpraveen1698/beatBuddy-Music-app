18 ContributorsThe Logical Song Lyrics[Intro]
When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me

[Pre-Verse 1]
Good morning!
Yeaaaaaah!
One, two... one, two, three, four!
Pump it up!
Aaaah!

[Verse 1]
I ramp, me no ramp, me no skin
Me no play, yeah
When me chant 'pon the microphone
And me say with the DJ
Junglists in the place
Junglists on the case
Scooter, are you Ratty?

[Chorus]
When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me (Yeah!)
When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me (Come on!)
