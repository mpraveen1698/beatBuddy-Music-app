4 ContributorsYouâ€™re All I Need Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know that she's waiting
For me to say forever
I know that I sometimes
Just don't know how to tell her
I want to hold and kiss her
Give her my love
Make her believe
She doesn't know
She doesn't know

[Chorus]
You're all I need beside me, girl!
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart

[Post-Chorus]
You're all that I need
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
I know that she's always
There when I need her loving
I know that I never
Told her how much I love her
I see her face before me
I look in her eyes
Just wondering why
She doesn't know
She doesn't know

[Chorus]
You're all I need beside me, girl!
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart

[Bridge]
Say
Say that you'll be there
Whenever I reach out
To feel your hand in mine
Stay
Stay within my heart
Whenever I'm alone
I know that you are there
Oooooh!

[Chorus]
You're all I need beside me, girl!
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart
You're all I need beside me, girl!
All that I need
All I need to turn my world
All that I need beside me, girl!
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart
[Outro]
All that I need
Is for you to believe
All that I need
Is youEmbed You're All I Need Mane Attraction White Lion hard-rock
