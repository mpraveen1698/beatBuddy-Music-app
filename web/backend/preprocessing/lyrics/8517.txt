Daydream
Life feels like a daydream
And I just wish that I could wake up
I just wish that I could wake up
My mind
Whispers in the nighttime
Voices always keeping me up
Telling me that I should give up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause lately, I've been in the backseat to my own life
Trying to take control, but I don't know how to

[Chorus]
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to be sad no more
I don't want to wake up and wonder
What the hell am I doing this for
I don't want to be medicated
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to go one more day
I just want to wake up and realize
Everything's going to be okay
I don't know how else to say it
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore

I'm coming through to the other side
I'll make it through to tomorrow
'Cause that's all I can do today, do today

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause lately, I've been in the backseat to my own life
Trying to take control, but I don't know how to

[Chorus]
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to be sad no more
I don't want to wake up and wonder
What the hell am I doing this for
I don't want to be medicated
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to go one more day
I just want to wake up and realize
Everything's going to be okay
I don't know how else to say it
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore
[Bridge]
Sad anymore
Sad anymore

[Chorus]
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to be sad no more
I don't want to wake up and wonder
What the hell am I doing this for
I don't want to be medicated
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to go one more day
I just want to wake up and realize
Everything's going to be okay
I don't know how else to say it
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore15Embed Sad Forever ~how i'm feeling~ Lauv electro
