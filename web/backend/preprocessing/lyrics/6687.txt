4 ContributorsOn The Low Lyrics[Intro]
And keep it on the low
And never talk loud
Just so they know

[Verse 1]
That guy you've been seein' in your dreams
You'd be lying if you said it wasn't me
Same time, got me caught up in my feelings
All-time, baby, you one in a million
Like wow, we be acting so blind
Like how we be wasting this time?
All good, we should just get back to living
We both know that this business isn't finished

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we got history
Stuck in the in-between
But baby, finally, we

[Chorus]
Ain't gotta keep it on the low
Backstage pourin' up before the show ('Ight, 'ight)
When we stuntin', we loud, we loud
We loud just so they know
Ain't gotta keep it on the low
Up late, find me on the top floor ('Ight, 'ight)
When we stuntin', we loud, we loud
We loud just so they know

Old times, yeah, we thought it was a phase
Too many times we just called it a mistake
No way, this ain't happen for no reason
I'm just saying I don't think that we should leave it
Gone for a minute, but we back at it again
Lost all up in it, no, we don't gotta pretend, yeah
Time is a blessing, and I see it making sense (Mm)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we got history
Stuck in the in-between
But baby, finally, we

[Chorus]
Ain't gotta keep it on the low
Backstage pourin' up before the show ('Ight, 'ight)
When we stuntin', we loud, we loud
We loud just so they know
Ain't gotta keep it on the low
Up late, find me on the top floor ('Ight, 'ight)
When we stuntin', we loud, we loud
We loud just so they know

[Bridge]
And keep it on the low
And never talk loud
Just so they know
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we got history
Stuck in the in between
But baby, finally, we

[Chorus]
Ain't gotta keep it on the low
Backstage pourin' up before the show ('Ight, 'ight)
When we stuntin', we loud, we loud
We loud just so they know
Ain't gotta keep it on the low
Up late, find me on the top floor ('Ight, 'ight)
When we stuntin', we loud, we loud
We loud just so they know1Embed On the Low Places Like Home Justin Park chill
