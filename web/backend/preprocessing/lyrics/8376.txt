9 ContributorsThe Safety of Disbelief Lyrics[Intro]
I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly

[Verse 1]
There's nothing left that we can say
Nothing gold can ever stay
It's easier to run away
It's easier to curse than pray

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No sacrifice, now burn it at the altar

[Chorus 1]
I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
Return to the safety of disbelief

[Verse 2]
You want to lay your doubt aside
Faith has nowhere left to hide
I'm the one with hollow eyes
I'm the one you now despise

[Chorus 2]
I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
Return to the way that you bleed for me
Return to the safety of disbelief
You might also like[Bridge]
For you and all your dreams
I feel nothing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
Return to the way that you bleed for me
Return to the safety of disbelief

[Chorus 1]
I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
Return to the safety of disbelief

[Chorus 2]
I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
Return to the way that you bleed for me
Return to the safety of disbelief

[Outro]
For you and all your dreams
I feel nothingEmbed The Safety of Disbelief Revival Light The Torch metalcore
