Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Where is the time goin' again?
I lost a home, I lost a friend
Love's an ocean whether you sink or swim
I gave you my best, was it enough?
Maybe the past is holdin' me up
I keep the memories with me, replay what was

[Pre-Chorus]
So long, baby, did you know you saved me?
Silver line faded, but you know I'll keep waiting

[Chorus]
'Cause when I think of us, I always seem to smile
'Cause I was happy for a while, I was happy for a while, yeah
And sometimes, love will leave you even when it's right
But I was happy for a while, and I don't know how I'll smile again

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Remember your face like it was here
I'm getting used to all of the tears
And I'm getting used to forever without you here
And I don't know how I'll smile again
Ask if I'm good, I gotta pretend
I'm holdin' on to three words I should've said

Silver line faded, but you know I'll keep waiting

[Chorus]
'Cause when I think of us, I always seem to smile
'Cause I was happy for a while, I was happy for a while, yeah
And sometimes, love will leave you even when it's right
But I was happy for a while, and I don't know how I'll smile again

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause I was happy for a while
And I don't know how I'll smile again5Embed smile again everything means nothing blackbear electro
