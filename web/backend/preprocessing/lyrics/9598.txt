Damn
Heh heh
Okay, okay like who 'dat
Lookin' at you feel like a relapse
Lookin' at you can barely relax
I'm a landlord needin' a revamp
I mean that, I'm with no hoes, I'm meaning I've got more dough
Than a baker in the zone, concede I'm solo like Caesar but, though
I'm needing, breathing, you're leaving so just know [hey], I need a reason to be here, you been my reason but so [yo]
I'm feeling lonely, another night off the Goldie I'm chillin'
Look, tell my homies these villains have got me reelin' no more
Hold up, I've got to see this [see this], new man I hope he's decent yes
My friend? Yeah she's recent, just friends but not this weekend
Her gram has got my feature
Her man ain't home to see this [no way]
I know that you gon' read this
So take the L like he did [heh heh]

[Conor Gardiner: Chorus]
So I don't need you to follow me
Got me chasin' that good time you be gone with no goodnight
I don't know why you can't be mine, mine
Said I don't need you to follow me
Got me chasin' that good time you be gone with no goodnight
I don't know why you can't be mine, mine (yeah)

Yuh, just take what you need
OT, but feelin' OD
Low key but starin so deep
Postin' by liking my feed
Heightening my psyche
Psych, I'm showin' my emotions
I'm Hoping it's kosher, your motive got me feeling emotions, ayy
See the hills, see the plains, takin' pills for my pain
Shit will never change emotions made me levitate
Busy testing fate until my resting date, there's the way it is, that's the way y'all live, constantly in bliss

[Conor Gardiner: Chorus] x2
So I don't need you to follow me
Got me chasin' that good time you be gone with no goodnight
I don't know why you can't be mine, mine
Said I don't need you to follow me
Got me chasin' that good time you be gone with no goodnight
I don't know why you can't be mine, mine (yeah)
Said I don't need you to follow me
Got me chasin' that good time you be gone with no goodnight
I don't know why you can't be mine, mine (yeah)
Said I don't need you to follow me
Got me chasin' that good time you be gone with no goodnight
I don't know why you can't be mine, mine (yeah)3Embed Follow Me Follow Me Rella;Conor Gardiner emo
