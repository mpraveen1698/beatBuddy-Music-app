Well, it's midnight, damn right, we're wound up too tight
I've got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just bit me
Oh
That shit makes me bat shit crazy
We've got no fear, no doubt, all in, balls out

[Chorus]
We're going out tonight (Hey!)
To kick out every light (Hey!)
Take anything we want (Hey!)
Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 2]
We're screaming like demons, swinging from the ceiling
I got a fist full of fifties, tequila just hit me
Oh
We got no class, no taste, no shirt, and shit faced
We got it lined up, shot down, firing back straight crown

[Chorus]
We're going out tonight (Hey!)
To kick out every light (Hey!)
Take anything we want (Hey!)
Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooh
Ooh

Tickin' like a time bomb, drinkin' till the nights gone
Well, get your hands off of this glass, last call my ass
Well, no chain, no lock, and this train won't stop
We got no fear, no doubt, all in, balls out

[Chorus]
We're going out tonight (Hey!)
To kick out every light (Hey!)
Take anything we want (Hey!)
Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooh
We're going out tonight (Hey!)
To kick out every light (Hey!)
Take anything we want (Hey!)
Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight7Embed Burn It to the Ground Dark Horse Nickelback metal
