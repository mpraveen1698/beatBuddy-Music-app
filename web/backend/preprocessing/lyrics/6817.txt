1 ContributorQuarterbackin’ Lyrics(Chorus)

I'm quarterbackin' this track like Tom Brady
No quarterback sacks like Charles Haley
And I'm throwin' at corners like Deion Sanders
It's first and ten and I'm droppin' the hammer

(Verse 1)

No time for slackin' when I'm quarterbackin'
Fourth and short, it's a QB sneak
If it's first and ten then I'm throwin' it deep
I'm a weight room legend like Scott Walker
Bench press, power clean, I throw farther
Long jump, cut back, I run harder
Montana jersey in San Francisco
How 'bout Brent Jones in the back of the end  zone?
Silver and black across the bridgе though
Number twelve Stablеr, easy call
Immaculate reception like Bradshaw
Boomer got bounced by the best
But the Bengals still get my respect
My fav. triple eights are Young and Aikman
And Mark Brunell, left hand pump-fakin'
Leavin' cornerbacks with their ankles breakin'
You might also like(Chorus)

I'm quarterbackin' this track like Tom Brady
No quarterback sacks like Charles Haley
And I'm throwin' at corners like Deion Sanders
It's first and ten and I'm droppin' the hammer

(Verse 2)

I'm a New York Giant like Eli Manning
I respect the Jets, 'cuz New York's family
Cornerback coaches just can't stand me
I love the Pats, Brady's the GOAT
Foxborough or Tampa, he's cut-throat
My Dad's favorite pick is Michael Vick
Have you ever seen how he throws that quick?
A one-man show, at the Sugar Bowl
But I still gotta go, with Marino
And I'm good lookin' like Garoppolo
Brett Favre's a legend in my eyes
He threw four TD's the day his dad died
And I never throw pigskin, just cowhide
I'm like Tua rollin' with the tide
Peyton in Denver just gettin' it done
Then pluggin' my products when we won
If I'm left alone, and free to roam
I'll be in the end zone with Mahomes
If I'm left alone, and free to roam
I'll be in the end zone with Mahomes
If I'm left alone, and free to roam
I'll be in the end zone with Mahomes
(Chorus)

I'm quarterbackin' this track like Tom Brady
No quarterback sacks like Charles Haley
And I'm throwin' at corners like Deion Sanders
It's first and ten and I'm droppin' the hammer


(Verse 3)

I'm a tiger on the field like Trevor Lawrence
Sooner and later like Jalen Hurts
QB ratings I come in first
Move  around swim moves like JJ Watt
Play in Green Bay or where it's hot
In Dallas I'm the talk just like Prescott
Fold 'em like Rosen in Texas Hold 'em
Slashin' defenses like Kordell Stewart
More action than Jackson, just like Lamar
Snap me the ball and I run hard
Run the shotgun on first and ten
Stand tall in the pocket just like Big Ben
Superman like Cam giving balls to kids
Giving back to youth, that's how I live
I can scramble like Randall or Warren Moon
Tell the end zone I'm coming soon
O-line, like the Great Wall of China
No move you can do, to get behind 'em
On the depth chart I'm number one
No need for back-ups, 'cuz I'm that one!
(Chorus)

I'm quarterbackin' this track like Tom Brady
No quarterback sacks like Charles Haley
And I'm throwin' at corners like Deion Sanders
It's first and ten and I'm droppin' the hammerEmbed Wahran Wahran RANDALL electronic
