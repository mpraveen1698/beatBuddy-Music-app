When it comes to drugs, pill-pushers and takers (Lil Peep)
We are a country virtually out of control (Cold Hart) (Lil Peep)
If you're feeling depressed, to get relief, take a pill (Baby)
Most of us are addicts

[Verse 1: Lil Peep & Cold Hart]
Life gets hard sometimes, I know
So I be leanin', I be smoking my dope
I see your face everywhere that I go
It's the only thing that remind me of home
I be with my team racing whips on the road (Skrrt)
Rolling off a bean that I took at the show
Young limousine, I'm a backseat rider
She only call my phone when she think that I'm dyin'
Baby, you're the one for me, that's fo' sho'
I just need your company, so ride slow
This ain't what you want from me, so cold
You're the only one for me, I know (Ohh)

[Chorus: Cold Hart]
You're the only one that I love (I love)
And I can't name one person I trust
But if you're on one, then I'm on one too (One too)
And if you're leaving, then I'll go with you (I'll leave with you)
You're the only one that I love (I love)
And I can't name one person I trust
And if you're on one, then I'm on one too (One too)
If you're leavin', then I'll leave with you
You might also like[Bridge: Cold Hart]
I'll leave with you (Ohh)
I'll leave with you
Cold Hart, baby

[Verse 2: Cold Hart]
Yeah she asking me, "What are we?"
I'm like, "What you mean?" (What you mean?)
I'm smoking gasoline with my team
GBC, they'll be there with me
And I know I ain't shit, but you a masterpiece
Kurt Cobain jeans, you my Courtney Love
Thraxxl Rose how I got the club going up
Taking bars for anxiety
Smoking kush is my therapy

[Chorus: Cold Hart]
You're the only one that I love (I love)
And I can't name one person I trust
But if you're on one, then I'm on one too (On one too)
And if you're leaving, then I'll go with you
You're the only one that I love (I love)
And I can't name one person I trust
And if you're on one, then I'm on one too (On one too)
If you're leaving, then I'll leave with you
Yeah, I'll leave with you
[Outro: Godfrey Cambridge]
Other people have seen their friends die
I don't want anyone to see any of their friends die anymore23Embed Dying The OC Season 3 Cold Hart;Lil Peep emo
