Legs are tired, these hands are broken
Alone, I try with words unspoken
Silent cry, my breath is frozen
With blinded eyes, I fear myself

[Chorus]
It's burning down, it's burning high
When ashes fall, the legends rise
We burned it out a mile wide
When ashes fall, the legends rise

[Verse 2]
My throat is dry, my vision's fading
I'm paralyzed and left here waiting
Taking time, just one step forward
Won't lose my mind, I'm here to stay

[Chorus]
It's burning down, it's burning high
When ashes fall, the legends rise
We burned it out a mile wide
When ashes fall, the legends rise

[Bridge]
Whoa
Legends rise
Whoa
Legends rise (Legends rise, rise, rise)
Legends rise (Rise, rise, rise, rise)
You gonna do somethin' about it
Or just stand there and bleed?
