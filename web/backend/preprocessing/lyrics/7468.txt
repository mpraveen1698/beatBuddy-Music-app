16 ContributorsDarkness Settles In Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another sun sets down behind me
Another day comes crashing in
There's a whispering wind that's blowing
There's a storm that's closing in
I can hear the trains, they're rolling
To a place I've never been
And I can feel her breath beside me
With an empty glass of gin
As the darkness settles in
I can hear her voice again
I can hear your voice again

[Chorus]
Waiting for someone to save me
But everyone just runs away (Runs away)
Waiting for someone to change me
But no one ever comes
I'm breaking down the walls that cage me
But nothing ever falls in place (Falls in place)
Waiting for the end to take me
Blinded by the sun

[Verse 2]
All the ghosts that live inside me
Always waiting in the wind (Wind)
I can see through my reflection
What I've become and what I've been (Been)
You see, your Heaven doesn't want me
And your Hell won't let me in (In)
It's like I'm holding all the aces
But that I know I'll never win (Win)

Waiting for someone to save me
But everyone just runs away (Runs away)
Waiting for someone to change me
But no one ever comes
I'm breaking down the walls that cage me
But nothing ever falls in place (Falls in place)
Waiting for the end to take me
Blinded by the sun

[Post-Chorus]
You can take it away, tear it all down
Spit in my face, pushed to the ground
Look what I've become
I've fallen from grace, bloodied and bound
Taking up space, lost and I'm found
Look what I've become

[Bridge]
I can hear the snakes, they're winding
Singing songs of pain and sin
There's an anger overflowing
From this empty glass of gin
As the darkness settles in
And the darkness settles in
[Chorus]
Waiting for someone to save me
But everyone just runs away (Runs away)
Waiting for someone to change me
But no one ever comes
I'm breaking down the walls that cage me
But nothing ever falls in place (Falls in place)
Waiting for the end to take me
Blinded by the sun

[Outro]
(You can take it away)
And the darkness settles in
(You can take it away)
And the darkness settles in
(You can take it away)
