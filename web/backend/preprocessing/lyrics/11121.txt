78 ContributorsHOLD ME TIGHT OR DON’T Lyrics[Intro]
Oh na na na na na na na na na na

[Verse 1]
I never really feel a thing, I'm just kinda too froze
You were the only one, that even kinda came close
I just pinch myself, no longer comatose
I woke up, no luck, I woke up, no luck

[Pre-Chorus]
And when your stitch comes loose, I wanna sleep on
Every piece of fuzz and stuffing that comes out of you
You, I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down

[Chorus]
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no, this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't

[Post-Chorus]
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na

I got too high again, realized I can't not be with you
Or be just your friend, I love you to death, but I just can't
I just can't pretend, we were lovers first
Confidants but never friends, were we ever friends?

[Pre-Chorus]
But when your stitch comes loose, I wanna sleep on
Every piece of fuzz and stuffing that comes out of you
You, I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down

[Chorus]
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no, this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't

[Post-Chorus]
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Hold me tight, or don't

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm past the limits
The distance between us, it sharpens me like a knife
Past the limits
The distance between us, it sharpens me like a knife
[Chorus]
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
I'm pretty sure that this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight, hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't

[Post-Chorus]
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na50Embed HOLD ME TIGHT OR DON’T MANIA Fall Out Boy emo
