17 ContributorsDavidian Lyrics[Verse 1]
Blind man, ask me forgiveness
I won't deny myself
Disrespect you have given
Your suffering's my wealth
I feed off pain, force fed to love it
And now I swallow whole
I'll never live in the past

[Refrain]
Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast

[Verse 2]
Burn my fist to the concrete
My fear is my strength
Power, rage unbound because
Been pounded by the streets
Cyanide blood burns down the skyline
Hatred is purity
The bullet connects at last

[Refrain]
Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast

Scarred
Scarred
Scarred
Scarred
Scarred (Pour the salt in the wound)
Scarred (Pour the salt in the wound)
Scarred (Pour the salt in the wound)
Unscarred
