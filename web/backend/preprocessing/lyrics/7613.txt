I gotta find my way back
Back to summer paradise
Sean Paul, Simple Plan

[Verse 1: Pierre Bouvier & Sean Paul]
My heart is sinking as I'm lifting
Up above the clouds away from you
And I can't believe I'm leaving
Oh I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do
But someday
I will find my way back to where
Your name is written in the sand (Stay in my brain)

[Chorus: Pierre Bouvier & Sean Paul]
'Cause I remember every sunset
I remember every word you said
And we were never gonna say goodbye (Yeah)
Singing la-da-da-da-da
Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
(Quick time, quick time girl) Oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat
(Quick time, quick time girl) Oh-oh

My soul is broken
Streets are frozen
I can't stop these feelings melting through
And I'd give away a thousand days, oh
Just to have another one with you (Baby girl)
Well, real life can wait (It can wait)
We're crashing like waves (Yeah)
We're playing in the sand (Me and you girl)
Holding your hand (Make some noise)

[Chorus: Pierre Bouvier & Sean Paul]
'Cause I remember every sunset (Well, I remember)
I remember every word you said
And we were never gonna say goodbye (Yeah)
Singing la-da-da-da-da
Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you (Yeah)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
(Quick time, quick time girl) Oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat
(Quick time, quick time girl) Oh-oh

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]
Because mi sit down inna di tour, but I freeze
Thinking about the sunshine under trees
Summertime on the beach
So fine, oh you know say that I'm in dem trees
Baby girl, you really got what mi need
It's three o'clock, and we deh deh anytime that you need
In a heartbeat, girl, sex on the beach
Just say the word, SP a go reach
Loving increase, put it upon repeat
[Bridge: Pierre Bouvier & Sean Paul]
Someday
I will find my way back
To where your name
Is written in the sand
(Bring it back, bring it back, rewind, rewind)

[Chorus: Pierre Bouvier & Sean Paul (Both)]
'Cause I remember every sunset (Well, I remember)
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye (No way)
Singing la-da-da-da-da
Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you (Yeah)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat

[Outro: Pierre Bouvier & Sean Paul]
I remember where we first kissed (I remember)
And how I didn't wanna leave your lips
And how I've never ever felt so high (So high)
Singing la-da-da-da-da
So tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you (Yeah)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
(Quick time, quick time girl) Oh-oh
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
(Quick time, quick time girl)  Oh-oh
Summer paradise, baby
