10 ContributorsDo Ya Wanna Taste It Lyrics[Intro]
Do you really wanna, do you really wanna taste it

[Verse 1]
(Get it on, get it on top) Make a move extreme
Make a pose shortcut to your dreams
A float straight to the stars on that flying thing
(Getting high, getting brave) Getting snowblind game
(Set, go) Pick a tune, chick harpoon in a world beyond
Get a beat, got a heat on a phony string
Tear your world apart
Once the magic starts

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna, do you really wanna taste it
What's going up must come down
Do you really wanna, do you really wanna taste it
Baby you're losing ground
Blind to what you'll soon become
The mirror lies, the whole world's wrong
But you dancing with blinkers on
Throw your dog the invisible bone

[Verse 2]
(Say I do, say I will) and put your jet in gear
Anything to get you out of here
Gotta go hit that ride to the setting sun
(Pack it up, get ahead) Gotta leave this mess
Behind, gotta cruise from the blues got a life to find
What you need's, there to read on the dotted line
Kill your selfcontrol
Welcome to the show
You might also like[Chorus]
Do you really wanna, do you really wanna taste it
What's going up must come down
Do you really wanna, do you really wanna taste it
Baby, you're losing ground
Blind to what you'll soon become
The mirror lies, the whole world's wrong
But you dancing with blinkers on
Throw your dog the invisible bone

[Bridge]
Poison to your mind
Devil in disguise

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna, do you really wanna taste it
What's going up must come down
Do you really wanna, do you really wanna taste it
Baby, you're losing ground
Blind to what you'll soon become
The mirror lies, the whole world's wrong
But you dancing with blinkers on
Throw your dog the invisible bone
Do you really wanna, do you really wanna taste it
What's going up must come down
Do you really wanna, do you really wanna taste it
Baby, you're losing ground
Blind to what you'll soon become
The mirror lies, the whole world's wrong
But you dancing with blinkers on
Throw your dog the invisible bone4Embed Do Ya Wanna Taste It Non Stop Rock'n Roll Wig Wam metal
