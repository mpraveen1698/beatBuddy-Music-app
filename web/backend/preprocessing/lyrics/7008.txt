I been tryin' hard, you've been layin' low (Low)
I've been movin' mountains, pushin' through the snow
I can't feel my fingers, I can't feel my toes
Love won't be my savior, I should let it go
She's got these eyes, jaded, she's a gem
I might fall in love, I might break my heart again
Love it when she laughs
Fuck, I love it when she breathes
I get dizzy when she speaks 'cause she's exactly what I need (Woah)

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't wanna waste your time (Time)
I just wanna give you mine (Mine)
And I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna give you mine

[Verse]
I think it might be best for me to let you go
But if you ever love me you should let me know
I know you really want him, guess I'm fine with that
Be careful with your heart 'cause I'm not good at that
Picking up the pieces
Does he hold you while you're sleepin'?
Heard he loves you, does he mean it?
Does he care about your dreams and all your goals and how you'll meet 'em?
Does he call you every evening?
Is he making sure you're eating?
Do you love him how he loves you, is it even fucking even?

I won't wait around for him to break your heart
I can't mend your soul, I don't know where I'd start
I don't wanna fight again, I know it gets hard
I don't wanna fight again, I know it gets hard

[Chorus]
I been tryin' hard, you've been layin' low (Low)
I've been movin' mountains, pushin' through the snow
I can't feel my fingers, I can't feel my toes
Love won't be my savior, I should let it go
She's got these eyes, jaded, she's a gem
I might fall in love, I might break my heart again
Love it when she laughs
Fuck, I love it when she breathes
I get dizzy when she speaks 'cause she's exactly what I need (Woah)

[Outro]
And I don't wanna waste your time (Time)
I just wanna give you mine (Mine)
And I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna give you mine36Embed jaded jaded sadeyes emo
