2 Contributors626 Lyrics[Part 1 - "The 626"]
Instrumental: Snoop Dogg & Wiz Khalifa - "Young, Wild & Free" (feat. Bruno Mars)

[Chorus: Jason Chen]
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good
In the SGV
So what we eat late
That's how it’s supposed to be
6-2-6, young, wild, and free
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good
In the SGV
So what we eat late
That's how it's supposed to be
6-2-6, young, wild, and free

[Verse 1: Andrew]
Hey, let me tell you about a place out east
Just Fifteen minutes from the LA streets
Hollywood doesn’t even know we exist
Like it's a mystical land, filled with immigrants
The food's authentic, the price is perfect
Where restaurants focus on the taste not service
Be ready to share 'cause it's family style
Time with the fam, makes granny proud!
You might also like[Verse 2: David]
We're far enough from LA where nobody's actin' phony!
Except maybe on our taxes, it’s cash only!
Tell the health department stop hating
’Cause a B rating stands for better tasting
Where kids drink more milk tea than liquor
And they roast more duck than Swishers
It's the 6-2-6, man check the address
Home of Sriracha and Panda Express

[Chorus: Jason Chen/Andrew]
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good
In the SGV
So what we eat late
That’s how it's supposed to be
6-2-6, young, wild, and free
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good
In the SGV
So what we eat late
That's how it's supposed to be
6-2-6, young, wild, and free (haha, hey, yo)
[Verse 3: Andrew & David]
Sometimes I wonder, am I still in America
How come there’s still a language barrier?
If you need help, read Yelp, check the reviews
My Elite friends make it easy to choose
There's traditional rivalries between high schools
They started back when there was still some white dudes
No matter where you go they can't match the price
So you're always coming back to the Cafe Life
If J-Town's got sake and K-Town soju
What do we have? Oh yea we got bobas
Hot spots to get some, hot pot and dim sum
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
From Shanghai to Saigon, Tokyo to Taiwan
Beijing to Hong Kong something to bite on
Valley, Atlantic, Garvey, I drive on
3 in the morning, cafes got their lights on

[Chorus: Jason Chen]
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good
In the SGV
So what we eat late
That's how its 'sposed to be
6-2-6, young, wild and free

[Verse 5: David]
I eat so much shop owners really love me
Girl friends wanna hug me
What's twenty to a playa like me
Can you please unplug me
What's good Latinos, I'm that Chino
Fancy chick, San Marino
MPK, Arcadia, El Monte all my people

[Verse 6: Andrew]
She wanna hit Santa Anita mall
After we eat out in Monterey Park
She Chinese but her mom from Vietnam
This food out here is so good, nom
