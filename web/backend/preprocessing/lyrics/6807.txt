29 ContributorsKILL CUPID Lyrics[Intro: Dro Kenji]
Ooh, no
Hey
I'm tellin' her, "Hey"
I'm tellin' her, "Hey"

[Pre-Chorus: Dro Kenji]
I'm tellin' her, "Hey, hey, can you be mine?"
Just seen you at the party and you look so fine
My thoughts get wrapped around, I'm stuck inside my head
I know that's over now, but I still want you in my bed

[Chorus: Dro Kenji]
I'm falling flat on my face
Fallin' down 'cause I'm over love
Tell me, how are you not over love?
Protectin' my heart with like all that I have
New Gucci duffel, lil' stick in this bag
I see that boy Cupid, put one in his back
I'm falling flat on my face
Fallin' down 'cause I'm over love
Tell mе, how are you not over love?
Protеctin' my heart with like all that I have
New Gucci duffel, lil' stick in this bag
I see that boy Cupid, put one in his back

Ride around, ride around my town, now go
Ride around, ride around my town, now go
Fallin' down, choppers with the extendos
Broken heart, all the pieces on the floor
There's blood in my eyes
From the top and I seen all of your lies
Yeah, fuck everything on my mind
No, think about all of the time
All time that we shared from the start (Yuh)
Made love in the dark (Woah)
Let it off, you a star (Woah), and I know you are

[Pre-Chorus: Dro Kenji]
I'm tellin' her, "Hey, hey, can you be mine?"
Just seen you at the party and you look so fine
My thoughts get wrapped around, I'm stuck inside my head
I know that's over now, but I still want you in my bed

[Chorus: Dro Kenji]
I'm falling flat on my face
Fallin' down 'cause I'm over love
Tell me, how are you not over love?
Protectin' my heart with like all that I have
New Gucci duffel, lil' stick in this bag
I see that boy Cupid, put one in his back
I'm falling flat on my face
Fallin' down 'cause I'm over love
Tell me, how are you not over love?
Protectin' my heart with like all that I have
New Gucci duffel, lil' stick in this bag
I see that boy Cupid, put one in his back
[Verse 2: Dro Kenji]
I never took her for the party type
Smokin' OG strong, got my lungs tight
Had to ask that lil' bitch what her tongue like
Pretty brown skin women is my kryptonite
She way up here, we walkin' on a cloud
I'll walk off a cliff for a bitch that would try to drag me down
But it's still "Fuck love" in the air
And I mean that shit with my heart and my head
Smoke two Backwoods of the Sticky
I be thinkin' 'bout why you ain't with me
Faded, oh, floatin' away (Float away right now)
Yeah, no

[Pre-Chorus: Dro Kenji]
I'm tellin' her, "Hey, hey, can you be mine?"
Just seen you at the party and you look so fine
My thoughts get wrapped around, I'm stuck inside my head
I know that's over now, but I still want you in my bed

[Chorus: Dro Kenji]
I'm falling flat on my face
Fallin' down 'cause I'm over love
Tell me, how are you not over love?
Protectin' my heart with like all that I have
New Gucci duffel, lil' stick in this bag
I see that boy Cupid, put one in his back
I'm falling flat on my face
Fallin' down 'cause I'm over love
Tell me, how are you not over love?
Protectin' my heart with like all that I have
New Gucci duffel, lil' stick in this bag
I see that boy Cupid, put one in his back
I'm falling flat on my face
Fallin' down 'cause I'm over love
Tell me, how are you not over love?
Protectin' my heart with like all that I have
