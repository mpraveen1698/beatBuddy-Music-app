60 ContributorsNo Rain Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watching the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane
It's not sane

[Chorus]
I just want someone to say to me, oh
"I'll always be there when you wake" yeah
You know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made (I'll have it made)

[Verse 2]
And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain that there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
Escape
Escape
Escape

Oh yeah
Ooh

[Bridge]
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
You don't like my point of view
You think that I'm insane
It's not sane
It's not sane

[Chorus]
I just want someone to say to me, no oh oh oh
"I'll always be there when you wake"
You know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made
