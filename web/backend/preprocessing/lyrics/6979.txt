15 ContributorsMore Than Friends Lyrics[Verse 1]
I often tell myself that we could be more than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon it will all end
I live in misery when you're not around
I won't be satisfied till we're taking those vows

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go

[Verse 2]
I often fantasize the stars above are watching
They know my heart, it speaks to yours like only lovers do
If I could wear your clothes I'd pretend I was you
And lose control
You might also like[Bridge 1]
There'll be some love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin' love
Love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin'

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
(Hold me tight and don't let go)

[Bridge 2]
Runnin' in and outta life
Has got me so confused
We gotta make a sacrifice
Somebody's gotta choose
We can make it if we try
For the sake of you and I
Together we can make it right

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
What's it gonna be?4Embed More Than Friends More Than Friends James Hype;Kelli-Leigh deep-house
