Ah, yeah, na-na, na-na, yeah
Na, na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na (Ahh)
Damn, Aidan, what you up to, bro?
What you been up to, Aidan? Yo, yeah, I been

[Chorus]
Dancing in my room, swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue, you're the one that I need
Dancing in my room, swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue, you're the one that I need (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
And baby, yeah, you give me reasons
Just to fight all of my demons
Yeah, I love it when you're speaking
'Cause you silence all my feelings
That feeling that I'm not okay
And everyone will run away
And lеave me in my room (Room)
Alone for just anothеr day
I'm sippin' on some lemonade
I wonder if you'll ever change
Fuck it, I don't even care
Baby, just go and ride my wave
You might also like[Chorus]
Dancing in my room, swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue, you're the one that I need (I been)
Dancing in my room, swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue, you're the one that I need
Dancing in my room, swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue, you're the one that I need (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
She's a very pretty girl
In a very shitty world
She got records on the wall
And a necklace made of pearls
She's an angel to my nightmares
Passage through my night scares
Whenever you are down (Down, down)
Just know that I'll be right there

[Chorus]
Dancing in my room, swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue, you're the one that I need
Dancing in my room, swaying my feet
Tryna give you love and a kiss on the cheek
Cotton candy skies like I'm stuck in a dream
And I've been feeling blue, you're the one that I need11Embed Dancing in My Room Dancing in My Room 347aidan sad
