7 ContributorsThe Outsider Lyrics[Verse 1]
Does it feel like there’s somebody missing at the party
Or is everybody fine where they are? (Without me)
Do you even care that I'm the only one not there
Or was forgetting me not really that hard?

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I hate missing out?
Or hate the thought of you not missing me?
Missing me?
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
See it still when I close my eyes
I go back to those summer nights
Driving fast down a dead-end road
Staying out past the afterglow
Now you're laughing with someone new
Doing things that we used to do
And I'm just someone you used to know
The outsider of an inside joke

[Verse 2]
So hard not to notice when you’re not around
Caught up in a memory and I can’t come down
And nobody warned me
How bad it would haunt me
To see you so happy
Out on your own

Do I hate missing out?
Or hate the thought of you not missing me?
Missing me?
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
See it still when I close my eyes
I go back to those summer nights
Driving fast down a dead-end road
Staying out past the afterglow
Now you're laughing with someone new
Doing things that we used to do
And I'm just someone you used to know
The outsider of an inside joke

[Bridge]
Is the joke on me?
Was I the only one that
Didn’t see it coming?
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Is the joke on me?
Was I the only one  that
Didn't see it coming?
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Chorus]
See it still when I close my eyes
I go back to those summer nights
Driving fast down a dead-end road
Staying out past the afterglow
Now you're laughing with someone new
Doing things that we used to do
And I'm just someone you used to know
The outsider of an inside joke
And I'm just someone you used to know
The outsider of an inside jokeEmbed The Outsider The Outsider Lyn Lapid songwriter
