Sail away (Woo-hoo)
Sometimes I really wanna sail away (Woo-hoo)
Leave all those things I did in yesterday (Woo-hoo)
Is there a place I can stay? (Ooh)
Sometimes I really wanna sail away

[Chorus]
Sail away (Woo-hoo)
Sometimes I really wanna sail away (Woo-hoo)
Leave all those things I did in yesterday (Woo-hoo)
Is there a place I can stay? (Ooh)
Sometimes I really wanna sail away

[Verse 1]
I get inside my head so much, it happens
And honestly, I'm past it
I've lost sight of the magic
I think it might be time to break some habits
Be a little less dramatic
The past was only practice

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't tell you how I'm feelin' right now
If you want me to let it go, just say so

Lately all my nights are feelin' scripted
Some things to keep me lifted
It's pain that I'm releasin'
Please tell me a lie I can believe in
And offer me some healing
Won't you please give me a reason?

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't tell you how I'm feelin' right now
If you want me to let it go, just say so

I could use a holiday (Ooh)
Just a little getaway (Ooh)
I could really use an escape (Ooh)

Been tryin' to find my paradise (Ooh)
I'm just tryin' to sail away (Ooh)
