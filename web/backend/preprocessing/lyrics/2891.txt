22 ContributorsAmarillo by Morning Lyrics[Verse 1]
Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I got is just what I've got on
When that sun is high in that Texas sky
I'll be buckin' at the county fair
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo, I'll be there

[Verse 2]
They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend, somewhere along the way
Well, I'll be lookin' for eight when they pull that gate
And I hope that judge ain't blind
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo's on my mind

[Verse 3]
Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I got is just what I've got on
I ain't got a dime, but what I got is mine
I ain't rich, but Lord, I'm free
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo is where I'll be

[Outro]
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo is where I'll beSee George Strait LiveGet tickets as low as $72You might also like7Embed Amarillo By Morning Strait From The Heart George Strait country
