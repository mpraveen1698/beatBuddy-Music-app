3 ContributorsHugging You (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1 - Tom]
You took all the lonely days and you made them sing
You turned off the alarms so they don't ring
I don't know where we are in the grand scheme of things
But I just want to be hugging you tonight

[Verse 2 - Billie]
Life did throw everything that it could throw
Your face in the morning, it just glowed
Let's get in this car, let's face the sky and go
I just want to be counting stars with you

[Verse 3 - Billie with Tom ]
Ramp it up and let's go rolling down
There's no funnier duo in this town
Just want to say I'm better now and shout it loud
I just want to be hugging you tonight

[Refrain - Tom & Billie]
I don't know if you know, but I wanna tell you so
You're the wisest, funny one that I'll ever, evеr know

[Verse 4 - Tom & Billie]
A hundred mini dreams and a healing scar
Thе secrets of the day are never far
I don't know where we're going but God it's a start
I just want to be counting stars with you

I don't know if you know, but I wanna tell you so
You're the wisest, funny one that I'll ever, ever know
I don't know about you but, oh, I love us as a two
Find me a wild road and I will name it after you

[Verse 5 - Tom & Billie]
You took all the lonely days and you made them sing
You turned off the alarms so they don't ring
I don't know where we are in the grand scheme of things
But I just want to be hugging you tonightEmbed Hugging You - Acoustic Z-Sides Tom Rosenthal;Billie Marten british
