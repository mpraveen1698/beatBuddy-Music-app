Hi! (Hi!) We're your weather girls
(Uh-huh)
And have we got news for you!
(You better listen)
Get ready all you lonely girls
And leave those umbrellas at home
(Alright)

[Pre-Chorus]
Humidity is rising (Mm rising), barometer's getting low (How low, girl?)
According to all sources  (What sources now?)
The street's the place to go (You better hurry up)
'Cause tonight for the first time (First time)
Just about half-past ten (Half-past ten)
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men (Start raining men)

[Chorus]
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Every specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She bought every angel
And rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy

[Chorus]
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!

[Bridge]
I feel stormy weather moving in
About to begin (About to begin)
Hear the thunder, don't you lose your head
Rip off the roof and stay in bed (Rip off the roof and stay in bed)

[Verse 2]
God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She bought every angel
She rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
Oh, it's raining men! Yeah
[Pre-Chorus]

Barometer's getting low (Is getting low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, is getting low)
According to all sources (According to all sources)
The street's the place to go
