22 Contributors6ix9ine - BEBE ft. Anuel AA (English Translation) Lyrics[Intro: 6ix9ine]
Making love at the same time that you touch yourself (you get)
Baby, nothing will happen, go crazy (cra-crazy, crazy)
Your boyfriend treats you bad, he doesn’t control you (no, no, no, no)
He said-

[Pre-Chorus: Anuel AA]
My lil' devil (lil' devil)
She gets pornographic alone (baby)
Her husband doesn’t value her and leaves her alone (leaves her alone)
And I'm always waiting for her with my gun (gun)
And with me she always gets wet

[Chorus: Anuel AA, 6ix9ine]
Baby girl (uah)
Your boyfriend loves you but you are unfaithful (yeh-eh)
Because you're a devil inside of a woman (oh-oh, oh-oh)
And when the sun hides you want to drink, Daughter of Lucifer

Baby girl (my baby; uah, uah )
Your boyfriend loves you but you are unfaithful (why-why-why)
Because you're a devil inside of a woman (woma-a-an)
And when the sun hides you want to drink, Daughter of Lucifer

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine, Anuel AA]
Baby, with ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
Baby, I am your criminal
Baby, with ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
Baby, your boyfriend will forget it
Baby, with ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
Baby, with me you will move
Baby, with ram-bam-bam-bam-bam
Baby, with a shot he will die (get out!)
Why, why, why (why)
Why are you going to be faithful (why)
Why, why, why
Baby, forget about him (him)
You're my lil' devil and I'm your demon
An asylum love
And if I see you with him then I hate you
She always has me in insomnia

Medusa, Versace (Versace)
We always do 69 like Tekashi (yeh-eh)
I'll break to you the whole secret, Illuminati (-nati)
She hops out with me at the disco in the Ferrari (-rrari)
Smoking Mari' (uah)
And you got your body done, baby, in R.D
And we fuck and we always cum at the same time
And I made you the love and got wrapped up in your skin
And my dick on your pussy I tatted you
Oh-oh-oh (uah)
Baby, you're mine, forget that ma-a-n
And bounce that ass dancing reggaeton on me-e-e

[Chorus: Anuel AA, 6ix9ine]
Baby girl (uah)
Your boyfriend loves you but you are unfaithful (yeh-eh)
Because you're a devil inside of a woman (oh-oh, oh-oh)
And when the sun hides you want to drink, Daughter of Lucifer (oh-oh, oh-oh; uah)

Baby girl (my baby)
Your boyfriend loves you but you are unfaithful (why?)
Because you're a devil inside of a woman (-dy)
And when the sun hides you want to drink, Daughter of Lucifer (drink; -ghter)

[Outro: 6ix9ine]
My lil' devil (my girl)
She gets pornographic, she's not timid (look at me, baby)
And her man doesn't value her and leaves her alone (leaves her alone, alone)
And I’m always waiting for him with my gun (ra-pa-pa-pa)
And she always falls in love, my lil' devilEmbed BEBE DUMMY BOY 6ix9ine;Anuel AA emo
