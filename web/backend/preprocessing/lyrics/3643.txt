9 ContributorsSay My Name Lyrics[Intro]
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
Better say my name

[Verse 1]
Every other day, I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day," but today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh, yeah, okay"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me 'Baby'
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me 'Baby'

Why the sudden?

Ain't callin' me 'Baby'

[Verse 2]
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me 'Baby'
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me 'Baby'
[Post-Chorus]
Baby

Why the sudden?

Ain't callin' me 'Baby'
Baby

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me 'Baby'
