There's a voice I always trust
Its friendly helping hand tells me leave, I must

'Cause I can't stay forever, ah
'Cause I can't stay forever, ah
By my window

[Verse 2]
Rather chase a gentle breeze
Set my thoughts by taller trees

[Refrain]
'Cause I can't stay forever, ah
'Cause I can't stay forever, ah
By my window

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't stay forever
'Cause I can't stay forever
'Cause I can't stay forever
'Cause I can't stay forever

[Verse 3]
There's a voicе I always trust
Its friendly helping hand tells mе leave, I must
