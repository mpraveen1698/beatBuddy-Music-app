I could cry an ocean to keep me afloat
But the walls won't let me
I could leave the party, no one would know
But my feet are too heavy

[Pre-Chorus]
Some say she's fickle as water
Someone's daughter
Someone's 2 AM kiss in the night
Some know nothin' about her
Why she takes cold showers
Why she's a girl tryin' to get back inside

[Chorus]
Moon, walk me home
I'm dyin' here, dyin' here
Don't leave me alone
I'm tryin' here, tryin' herе
Save me from the night
Moon, walk mе home

[Verse 2]
If they could just breathe with my lungs for a day
Then they'd finally get it
How sometimes the truth is just too much to say
So it festers there while
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Some say she's fickle as water
Someone's daughter
Someone too drunk to ask for a ride
Some know nothin' about her
Why she takes cold showers
Why she's a girl tryin' to get back inside

[Chorus]
Moon, walk me home
I'm dyin' here, dyin' here
Don't leave me alone
I'm tryin' here, tryin' here
Save me from the night
Moon, walk me home

[Drop]
Walk me home
(Walk me home when)
(Walk me home when)
Save me from a wasted wish upon a star tonight
If you wouldn't mind
Moon, walk me home
