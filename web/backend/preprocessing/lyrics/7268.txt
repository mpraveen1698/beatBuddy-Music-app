Spent a lot of time in the background
You know I spent a lot of time in the background
Every time that we together, I black out
Every time that we together, she tap out
I remember, but she part of my past now
I remember all this shit from the past now
Took a pill and we passed out
I made a deal with the devil

[Verse]
You know I got my problems (Problems)
Know you got yours too (Know you got yours too)
Hold on to my revolver (Revolver)
They ain't lookin' for you (They ain't lookin' for you)
Oh, girl, don't even bother (Bother)
Why she act brand new? (Why she act brand new?)
Take what the devil offers (Offers)
I got nothin' to lose (I got nothin' to lose)

[Bridge]
(I got my problems)

[Chorus]
Spent a lot of time in the background
You know I spent a lot of time in the background
Every time that we together, I black out
Every time that we together, she tap out
I remember, but she part of my past now
I remember all this shit from the past now
Took a pill and we passed out
I made a deal with the devil
