I was on the brink of giving up
Something told me I should hang it up
Never thought I'd find a love quite like you
And I pray I never end up losing you
Find a way to mess a good thing up
In my heart I know it's always been you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, you're all that I want
Blaming myself, I keep holding us back

[Chorus]
Is this the real thing
Not just a feeling
Or is my mind playing tricks on my heart again?
Lost in the moment
Stuck on the feeling
But is my mind playing tricks on my heart again?

[Verse 2]
Late to the party
Nothing I can change 'bout it
I know I complain 'bout you
Spent the day away from you
Running away, met some new faces
Show me the way, you take me to places
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
What I know, you're all that I got
Why do I question if it's made to last?
And I know you're all that I want
Blaming myself, I keep holding us back

[Chorus]
Is this the rеal thing
Not just a feeling
Or is my mind playing tricks on my heart again?
Lost in the moment
Stuck on thе feeling
But is my mind playing tricks on my heart again?

[Post-Chorus]
(Playing tricks) Ah-ah-ah-ah
(Playing tricks) Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
(Is my mind playing tricks on?)
(Playing tricks)  Ah-ah-ah-ah
(Playing tricks) Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

[Outro]
Is this the real thing
Not just a feeling
Or is my mind playing tricks on my heart again?1Embed playing tricks playing tricks thuy chill
