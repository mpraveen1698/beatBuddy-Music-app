5 ContributorsYes, I Will Wait Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been stuck in right and wrongs
Lost here in my [?] too long
Wide awake but eyes are closed
Wondering how I could let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I ain't no saint
But I learn from my own mistakes

[Chorus]
Yes, I will wait
For a thousand nights
And a thousand more
'Til I reach that day
Don't want to waste
Another day in vein
Wanna feel your grace shining over me
Yes, I will wait
Feel your grace shining over me
Yes, I will wait
Feel your grace shining over me
Yes, I will wait

[Verse 2]
Thinking back on purple skies
Held you close, so caught up in your eyes
I still hear the melodies
Of everything we had that used to be
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I ain't no saint
But I learn from my own mistakes

[Chorus]
Yes, I will wait
For a thousand nights
And a thousand more
'Til I reach that day
Don't want to waste
Another day in vein
Wanna feel your grace shining over me
Yes, I will wait
Feel your grace shining over me
Yes, I will wait
Feel your grace shining over me
Yes, I will

[Bridge]
Out of the darkness
We will find us a way
Somewhere in the shadows
They're out there today
I might me crazy
But we're still the same
So I will wait
[Chorus]
Yes, I will wait
For a thousand nights
And a thousand more
'Til I reach that day
Don't want to waste
Another day in vein
Wanna feel your grace shining over me
Yes, I will wait
'Cause I wanna feel your grace shining over me
Yes, I will wait (ohhh)
Feel your grace shining over me
Yes, I will waitEmbed Yes, I Will Wait Yes, I Will Wait Victor Crone swedish
