'Cause It's a bitter sweet symphony, this life
Try to make ends meet
You're a slave to the money, then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one might take you to the places where all the [?} meet, yeah
[Chorus]
No change I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould
I am here in my mould
But I'm a million diffrent people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould
No-no
No-no-no
[Bridge]
'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony this life
'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony this life
[Verse 2]
But I never prayed but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some songs that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airways are clean
And theire's nobody singin' to me now
[Chorus]
No change I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould
I am here in my mould
But I'm a million diffrent people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould
No-no
No-no-no
[Outro]
