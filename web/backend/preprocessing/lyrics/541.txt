(Then I woke up in love, woke up in love)
(Then I woke up in love)

[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been losin' these nights
One more heartbreak and I'm done with this
Shadows on the ceilin', they don't fight
But I still argue for the hell of it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tryin' my hardest now, I feel you reachin' out
I don't wanna be the one that's always on the edge

[Chorus]
You found me all messed up
You found me down on my luck, so lost
But then I woke up in love
When I was chasin' highs
You went and saved my life
You picked me up
Thank God I woke up in love
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love
You might also like[Drop]
Then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love

[Verse 2]
Sometimes all those dark days, well, they try to find me
But that's when I lean on you
Whatever happens, my trouble's behind me
'Cause your love's gonna see me through

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing can bring me down, I feel you reachin' out
You're pullin' me back when I'm about to reach the edge

[Chorus]
You found me all messed up
You found me down on my luck, so lost
But then I woke up in love
When I was chasin' highs
You went and saved my life
You picked me up
Thank God I woke up in love
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love
[Drop]
Then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love

[Chorus]
You found me all messed up (All messed up)
You found me down on my luck, so lost
But then I woke up in love (Then I woke up in love)
When I was chasin' highs
You went and saved my life
You picked me up
Thank God I woke up in love (Woke up in love)
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love (Woke up in love)
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love1Embed Woke Up in Love Woke Up in Love Kygo;Gryffin;Calum Scott house
