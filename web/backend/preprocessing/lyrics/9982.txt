Something inside me
It is coming out
I feel like killing you
Let loose of the anger, held back too long
My blood runs cold
Through my anatomy dwells another being
Rooted in my cortex, servant to its bidding

[Chorus]
Brutality now becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
Sledge's my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead

[Verse 2]
Eyes bulging from their sockets
Every swing of my mallet
Smash your fucking head until brains seep in
Through the cracks, blood does leak
Distorted beauty, catastrophe
Steaming slop, splattered all over me
Lifeless body, slouching dead
Lecherous abscess where you once had a head
Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust
You will never live again, soon your life will end
I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face
Facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half

[Verse 3]
Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes
Squeezing them in my hands, nerves are incised
Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon
Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions

[Bridge]
Suffer, and then you die
Torture (Torture), pulverized

[Verse 4]
At one with my sixth sense, I feel free
To kill as I please, no one can stop me
Created to kill, the carnage continues
Violently reshaping human facial tissue

[Chorus]
Brutality becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
Sledge's my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead12Embed Hammer Smashed Face Tomb Of The Mutilated Cannibal Corpse death-metal
