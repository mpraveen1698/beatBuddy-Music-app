3 ContributorsIt Is Well (Live) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Grander earth has quaked before
Moved by the sound of His voice
Seas that are shaken and stirred
Can be calmed and broken for my regard

[Chorus]
And through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
And through it all, through it all
It is well
And through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
And it is well, with me

[Verse 2]
Far be it from me to not believe
Even when my eyes can't see
And this mountain that's in front of me
Will be thrown into the midst of the sea

[Chorus]
And through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
And through it all, through it all
It is well
And through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
And it is well
It is well

So let go my soul and trust in Him
The waves and wind still know His name
So let go my soul and trust in Him
The waves and wind still know His name!
So let go my soul and trust in Him
The waves and wind still know His name
The waves and wind still know His name

[Post-Bridge]
And it is well with my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
Oh, it is well with my soul
Oh, it is well with my soul
It is well with my soul!
It is well, it is well with my soul!
It is well, it is well with my soul!
It is well, it is well with my soul!

[Chorus]
And through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
And through it all, through it all
It is well
And through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
And it is well, with meEmbed It Is Well - Live You Make Me Brave (Live) Bethel Music;Kristene DiMarco ambient
