3 ContributorsHeartless Madness Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just close your eyes
Blind yourself to truth
Turn before you realize
The wisest things to choose

You want to see the world in awe
To marvel, to embrace
With logic you will lose it all
Let emotion guide this race

[Pre-Chorus]
We see the world as we choose
Close your eyes before you

[Chorus]
Take me
Although you hate me
For in heaven
There is no heartless madness
Blind me
Before the truth hurts
Show me heaven
I need your heartless madness

[Verse 2]
I'll slow your fall
Shield you from all shame
We dream until we forget all
Of life's eventual pain
You might also likeSee me just the way you want
Veil my wound and scars
Before the image falls apart
Let us walk among the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
With nothing left, we cannot lose
Close your eyes
Together we see the world as we choose
Close your eyes before you

[Chorus]
Take me
Although you hate me
For in heaven
There is no heartless madness
Blind me
Before the truth hurts
Show me heaven
I need your heartless madness

Show me heaven
I need your heartless madness

Take me
Although you hate me
For in heaven
There is no heartless madness
Blind me
Before the truth hurts
Show me heaven
I need your heartless madness

[Outro]
I need your heartless madness
I need your heartless madness
I need your heartless madness
