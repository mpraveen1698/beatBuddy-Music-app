"And who are you?," the proud Lord said
"That I must bow so low"
Only a cat of a different coat
That's all the truth I know
In a coat of gold or a coat of red
A lion still has claws
And mine are long and sharp, my lord
As long and sharp as yours

[Chorus]
And so he spoke, and so he spoke
That Lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
And not a soul to hear

[Verse 2]
"And who are you?," the proud Lord said
"That I must bow so low"
Only a cat of a different coat
That's all the truth I know

[Chorus]
And so he spoke, and so he spoke
That Lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
And not a soul to hear

[Chorus]
And so he spoke, and so he spoke
That Lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
And not a soul to hear
And so he spoke, and so he spoke
That Lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
And not a soul to hear
And not a soul to hearEmbed The Rains of Castamere Game Of Thrones: Season 8 (Music from the HBO Series) Ramin Djawadi;Serj Tankian german
