17 ContributorsTouch, Peel and Stand Lyrics[Verse 1]
Since I know how low to go
I won't let it show
Won't you touch me, touch me?
I won't let it go

And now I stand
And I peel for more
Won't you touch me, touch me?
I won't let it go

[Chorus]
Yes, I've finally found a reason
I don't need an excuse
I've got this time on my hands
You are the one to abuse

Yes, I've finally found a reason
I don't need an excuse
I've got this time on my hands
You are the one to abuse
One to abuse

[Verse 2]
You're always talking back to me
You won't let it be
Won't you touch me, touch me?
It never bothered you before
Now I stand, and I peel for more
Won't you touch me, touch me?
I won't let it go

Yes, I've finally found a reason
I don't need an excuse
I've got this time on my hands
You are the one to abuse

Yes, I've finally found a reason
I don't need an excuse
I've got this time on my hands
You are the one to abuse
One to abuse

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Yes, I've finally found a reason
I don't need an excuse
I've got this time on my hands
You are the one to abuse

Yes, I've finally found a reason
I don't need an excuse
I've got this time on my hands
You are the one to abuse

[Outro]
Yes, I've finally found a reason
I don't need an excuse
I've got this time on my hands
I've got this time on my hands
I've got this time on my hands
I've got this
You are the one to abuse
I've got this time on my hands
I've got this, I've got this
I've got this time on my hands
I've got this
You are the one to abuse
One to abuse
You are the one to abuse
