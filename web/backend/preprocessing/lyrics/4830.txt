We're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight
We're gonna chug-a-lug and shout
We're gonna cause talk and suspicion
Give an exhibition
Find out what it is all about

After midnight
We're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight
Gonna shake your tambourine
After midnight
It's gonna be peaches and cream, hm
We're gonna cause talk and suspicion
Give an exhibition
Find out what it is all about
After midnight
We're gonna let it all hang out

We're gonna cause talk and suspicion
Give an exhibition
Find out what it is all about

After midnight
We're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight
We're gonna let it all hang outYou might also likeEmbed After Midnight Naturally J.J. Cale blues
