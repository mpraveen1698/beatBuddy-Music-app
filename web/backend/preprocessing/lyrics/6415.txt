18 Contributorsâ€‹deep fake Lyrics[Verse 1: Sam Carter]
We, we wanna swim the deepest depths of oblivion (Oblivion)
We wanna know that the gods have us in control

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Carter]
We see the cards and we go to fold
We play along but it soon grows old (Soon grows old)
They took the ark and sold it all for parts

[Chorus: Sam Carter]
They've got a fist full of fucking gold
A return on the souls they sold (Souls they sold)
Do you remember who we are?
These tyrants will build an abyss
But the rest of us wish to exist (Wish to exist)
We're hiding like a shadow in the dark (In the dark)

[Post-Chorus: Sam Carter]
In the dark

[Verse 2: Sam Carter & Josh Middleton]
Be the change that you wanna see (No, not like that)
It's a risk, we can all agree (Fuck the fucking facts)
But it bleeds right in front of me (We're under attack)
Yeah, we all know that these rights are holy

We see the cards and we go to fold
We play along but it soon grows old (Soon grows old)
They took the ark and sold it all for parts

[Chorus: Sam Carter]
They've got a fist full of fucking gold
A return on the souls they sold (Souls they sold)
Do you remember who we are?
These tyrants will build an abyss
But the rest of us wish to exist (Wish to exist)
We're hiding like a shadow in the dark

[Bridge: Sam Carter]
We're never gonna leave this shell
Let's hope your gold don't fail you now
Save us a special place in hell
You're the reason that our hearts ache
Deep fake

[Breakdown: Sam Carter]
(We are one and the fucking same)

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Carter]
We see the cards and we go to fold
We play along, but it soon grows old (Soon grows old)
We took the ark and sold it all for parts
[Chorus: Sam Carter]
They've got a fist full of fucking gold
A return on the souls they sold (Souls they sold)
Do you remember who we are?
These tyrants will build an abyss
But the rest of us wish to exist (Wish to exist)
We're fighting with a shadow in the dark
