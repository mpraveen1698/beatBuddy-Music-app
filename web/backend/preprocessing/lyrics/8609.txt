Ba-ba
Da-da-da, da-da-da
Just writing songs
It was like
Yeah

[Chorus]
Daisy, I think you're a star
I know you think I'm crazy but that's just who you are
Say we go get famous, we could play the part
I've been having daydreams, thinkin' 'bout what's ours

[Verse]
What am I?
Just a boy with a dream, my head held high
Like a movie scene where the boy gon' chase forever
To your heart, my head is tethered
Just can't lie
She ain't paying rent in my mind
I got no regrets as long as you're around
You're the most beautiful flower I found
So stay out, paint a picture, take my breath away
You leavе me lost for words, I think of what to say
So stay out, paint a picture, take my brеath away
You leave me lost for words, I think hard on what to say, so
You might also like[Chorus]
Daisy, I think you're a star
I know you think I'm crazy but that's just who you are
Say we go get famous, we could play the part
I've been having daydreams, thinkin' 'bout what's oursEmbed daisy age tape 1 Arden Jones sad
