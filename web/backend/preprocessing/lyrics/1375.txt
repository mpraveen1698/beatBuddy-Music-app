[Intro: Luciano]
(Geenaro) Yeah
(So, I'm goin' to Ghana) Yay, ah

[Hook: Luciano & Central Cee]
Denn mein Check heut groß (Brr)
Boss, denn ich mach' Million'n, ah (Mwuah)
Und mein Flow hardcore
Guck, Big RS four-door, ah (Ih-yay)
Loco kommt hardcore
Connect London-West, ah (Dü-dü)
VVS-Diamond, grr-duh, Loco macht Scheine
Yo, we ain't ever been Berlin
But all of the whips German
They said, "Early bird gonna get the worm"
I'm hittin' them up when the birds chirpin'
Tell the young Gs, "Gotta keep workin'"
Crocodile teeth like Steve Irwin
Watch for the snakes, watch for the vermin
This weren't a mistake, did it on purpose

[Part 1: Luciano & Central Cee]
Energie black, voller Stacks
Criminal Shots, dеine Mama ist sad
Straight aus Block, hol' mir mein Cash
Bis zum End, guck, ich trag' Baguettеs
Fuck the media and the journalists
I don't want nothin' to do with the press
Fuck the Metropolitan Police
I don't want nothin' to do with the feds
Asmara, Asmara, guck, mein Girl ist hot, ja
Guck, heut groß (Ah) wie Zirkzee, Joshua
Joshua, Joshua, kick' Ghost wie Maradona (Ah)
Guck, bleib' Don (Ah), Berlin-Block, my city
He was on cloud nine, he was over the moon
Till I ruined his mood and his bubble got burst
Diamond in the rough, but I come out the mud
Head first, whole body was covered in dirt
You see the results when you put in the work
Put me anywhere on God's green earth
I triple my worth and you ain't hit hove?
Money on my mind since six years old

Viel Geld, mach' Geld on top, real boss, real Turk, I'm rich (Yay)
Hotel, Five Stars, Room-Check, guck, guck, viel Geld am Tisch (Dü-dü-dü)
Bad Gyal, mein Chick, laughin', oh wow, I want no bitch
Viel Geld, mach' Geld on top (Yeah), real boss, real Turk, I'm rich (Yay)

Yo, we ain't ever been Berlin
But all of the whips German
They said, "Early bird gonna get the worm"
I'm hittin' them up when the bird's chirpin'
Tell the young Gs, "Gotta keep workin'"
Crocodile teeth like Steve Irwin
Watch for the snakes, watch for the vermin
This weren't a mistake, did it on purpose

[Part 2: Luciano & Central Cee]
Shepherd's Bush, ah, pull up G-Wagon, ah
Kämpf' heut every day, mach' mein Cash, sipp' mein'n Hennessy
Shorty said she want diamonds, she don't want Pandora or no Tiffany
One billion streams, I don't even do punchlines, I don't do similes
Dropped one album and copped ten houses
I need to get more than residual income
Everythin' they do, we been done that
Their blueprint lookin' a little bit similar
Took man's flow, I don't mind, he can hold that
They can't chat to my monthly listeners
Fraud man sat in the internet caf'
He's on the same ting as the Tinder Swindler
Shepherd's Bush, ah, pull up G-Wagon, ah
Kämpf' heut every day, mach' mein Cash, sipp' mein'n Hennessy
Nhna bhansae, ich und mein Team machen Geld, ja
Wieso redest du Trap von Erfolg, lan? Immer noch broke (Ja)
West twelve, West twelve, Loco-Squad, Babe, guck, West twelve
Oh Boy, oh Boy, rede nicht viel, denn du kriegst ein'n Shot, ja (Du-rru)
UK-Germany-Connect am Block, ja (Hah)
Rede nicht viel, denn du kriegst ein'n Shot, ja (Bow)
