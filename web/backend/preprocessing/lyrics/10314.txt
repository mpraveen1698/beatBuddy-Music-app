Baby please, it's the way you speak
Forming words so easily
And I think of the way you think
It keeps me from falling asleep
In that grave I call a bed
Until you called me up and said:

[Verse 2]
"I haven't stopped crying
My father's been drinking
I need a place to stay
I don't want to be here
He's saying the words that
He promised he would never say
That liquid he consumes
Makes him speak the truth"

[Chorus 1]
And I said, "No, It's not that at all
It's that bottle of lies for a troubled heart
It's standing on the edge of a mountain top
Screaming anything he wants like
"Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Because I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist, I exist"

I remember the way you shook
It's a shame that we're not soul mates
Because if I didn't know better
I'd say this feels pretty good
And how could I be scared
When I stretch and feel you're there
So shut your mouth
Because these words will speak themselves
I can feel them in these blankets
And they're surrounding your figure
Embraced in the quilts
And I can't help but think
You're my missing puzzle piece

[Bridge]
I wake up in the hallway, I'm looking for sunlight
With the rays that will cure me of the pain that keeps my lungs tight
Ignoring the voices and feelings that tell me
To get out of this house
I can't make them stop
I'm just like my mom

[Chorus 2]
And you said, "No, these demons will fall
You're so precious to us all"
And I said, "I, I can't do this alone
I still need you to hold
So don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Because I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid"12Embed I Exist I Exist I Exist Scotland, I Wish You Had Stayed. Flatsound emo
