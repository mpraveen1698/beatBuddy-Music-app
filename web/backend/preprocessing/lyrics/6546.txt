It's getting cold, baby
I want your hot hands on me
It's getting cold, baby
I want your hot hands on me

[Chorus]
Hot hands, I need your hot hands on me
Hot hands, I need your hot hands on me

[Verse 1]
Our love is sweet, it might be pure
But there are some days I can't endure
Too lonely, cold, honestly
Give me those hot hands that I crave

[Chorus]
Hot hands, I need your hot hands on me
Hot hands, I need your hot hands on me
Hot hands, I need your hot hands on me
Hot hands, I need your hot hands on me

[Verse 2]
Hot hands on me
I need your hot hands on me
Hot hands on me (Hands, hands)
Hot hands on me (Hands, hands)
(Hands, hands)
(Hands, hands)
Hot hands on me, I need your hot hands on me

Hot hands, I need your hot hands on me
Hot hands, I need your hot hands on me

Hot hands on me
I want your hot hands on me
Hot hands on me
I want your hot hands on me2Embed Hot Hands Romance Darius disco
