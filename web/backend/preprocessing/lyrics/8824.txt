64 ContributorsNever Meant Lyrics[Intro]
Are we ready? (I am ready)
We- We can keep that one, right?
Ready?
One, two
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Let's just forget everything said
And everything we did
Best friends and better halves
Goodbyes
And the autumn night when we realized
We were falling out of love

[Chorus]
(There were some things that were said that weren't meant)
(There were some things that were said that weren't meant)
(There were some things that were said that weren't meant)
(There were some things that were said that weren't meant)
(There were some things that were said that weren't meant)
(There were some things that were said that weren't meant)
(There were some things that were said that weren't meant)
(There were some things that were saidâ€”) But we never did

[Verse 2]
Not to be overly (Overly)
Dramatic
I just think it's best
'Cause you can't miss what you forget
So, let's just pretend
Everything and anything
Between you and me
Was never meant
