Clap your hands in the air
And follow the music man

I am the music man
I come from down your way and I can play
What can you play?
I play the piano
Pia-pia-piano, piano, piano
Pia-pia, piano, pia-piano

I am the music man
I come from down your way and I can play
What can you play?
I play the trombone
Oompa-oompa-oompapa, oompapa, oompapa
Oompa-oompa-oompapa, oompa, oompapa

Piano
Pia-pia-piano, piano, piano

I am the music man
I come from down your way and I can play
What can you play?
I play the bagpipes
