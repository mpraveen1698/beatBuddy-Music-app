7 ContributorsPvP Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sign me up - domination
A taste what's to come
This clash is my life
And the stake is my soul
Detonate the demolition
Competition undone
I dictate this game
Like this game is my own

[Pre-Chorus]
As I make contact
One shot to master the zone
A god made flesh and
I am infinity personified
No concession
One bullet to settle the score
A grand collision
I will set it on fire

[Chorus]
We let the fates decide
It's like a bang! - Headshot
Right bеtween the eyes
(PvP)
High I risе
To my supremacy
Invincibility

[Verse 2]
Eradicate the opposition
My life for the horde
To this force I'm addicted
Goes right through my bones
Survive the simulation
The thrill is my reward
This blaze is my crown
And the stage is my throne

[Pre-Chorus]
And I make contact
One shot to master the zone
A godlike vision
I'm divinity personified
No concession
One bullet to settle the score
A grand collision
I will set it on fire

[Chorus]
We let the fates decide
It's like a bang! - Headshot
Right between the eyes
(PvP)
High I rise
To my supremacy
Invincibility

[Bridge]
All out attack
Never look back
Digging the trigger, the bigger my vigor is getting, consider, I'm cutting you slack
Just face the fact
Before you react
Sickening, second to none, in aggression
I just sick sack, hit back

[Reprise]
(Sign me up - domination)
(My life for the horde)
(This blaze is my crown)
(And the stage is my throne)

[Chorus]
We let the fates decide
It's like a bang! - Headshot
Right between the eyes
(PvP)
High I rise
To my supremacy
Invincibility
Fates decide
It's like a bang! - Headshot
Right between the eyes (between the eyes)
High I rise
To my supremacy
Invincibility
PvP
