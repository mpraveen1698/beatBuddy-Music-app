7 ContributorsFrom Gold Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll hold, so near and cold
You've exhumed my love
And I'm sold, and our story will grow old

[Verse 2]
And I'll know that your heart was once like mine
Watch the flaws unwind
And I'll throw my love to the ground
And I'll tear you outSee Novo Amor LiveGet tickets as low as $415Embed From Gold Woodgate, NY Novo Amor ambient
