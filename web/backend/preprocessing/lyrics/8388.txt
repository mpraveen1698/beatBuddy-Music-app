Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...

[Verse 1]
There will be highs, and lows... thank God I remain ok
How can I prove them how hourglasses drive me insane
And I'm amazed, when I think about how lucky I am
Not to wake up in a country full of bombings
Killings, 'side of them I got no fucking problems
Glad you never tried to put me down
Oh too many times I did you wrong
Diggin' in my inner me, then I found the enemies, how the fuck them niggas were too strong
And I kept those diamonds in my mind too long, no, they don't believe me 'cause I look too young
Keen everytime I see the beauty, bitter taste coming too quickly 'cause I'm always looking for what's wrong

[Chorus]
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...

[Verse 2]
Thank God I was dead, I came back three years ago
Body in the air, like they say it in these shows
You put me back in it, just to teach them what I know
Then I'll have to go
I gotta go, and see, all the shit that was in my mind
Thank God I do not live where Trump came after Obama
All my strength for the mamacitas, my brothers, sisters, never give up
Beginning of a new world that nobody wants, believe it or not I still do trust in us now

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah I know, I know, I know
Rose got thorns and I got a long way to go
Plus I told ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
No matter what happens we're never down, down, down

[Chorus]
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...19Embed THANK GOD WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE (Deluxe) Ril√®s french
