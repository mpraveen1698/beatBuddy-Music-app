48 ContributorsStupid for You Lyrics[Chorus]
Hey, tell me what you want me to say
You know I'm stupid for you
Hey, can you come-a come out and play?
You know I'm stupid for you

[Verse 1]
I'm color-coding my moods
You're yellow, I'm natural blue
Let's get together and be green like my insides
At least I'll match your eyes
Jealous and hypnotized
Let's match our faces and be equally in love

[Chorus]
Hey, tell me what you want me to say
You know I'm stupid for you
Hey, can you come and come out and play?
You know I'm stupid for you

[Verse 2]
Let's trash our whole afternoon
Reciting recycled news
Until we melt and go back to your hotel room
I'll be your new favorite tune
I'll be your black cloud by June
But only when you miss the rain like I miss you
You might also like[Bridge]
Just double dare me
And I promise now that I'll stay
It's not like you're married but I still got carried away

[Chorus]
Hey, tell me what you want me to say
You know I'm stupid for you
Hey, can you come and come out and play?
You know I'm stupid for you

[Chorus 2]
You're playing ring around my head
I wear you like a halo
You're a symphony, I'm just a sour note
I'll take what I can get
The best is hard to grip when everybody wants you
And everybody wants you
You're playing ring around my head
I wear you like a halo
You're a symphony, I'm just a sour note
I'll take what I can get
The best is hard to grip when everybody wants you

[Chorus]
Hey, tell me that you want me to stay
You know I'm stupid for you
Hey, can you come-a come out and play
You know I'm stupid for you
[Chorus 2]
You're playing ring around my head
I wear you like a halo
You're a symphony, I'm just a sour note
I'll take what I can get
The best is hard to grip when everybody wants you
And everybody wants you

And everybody wants you
And everybody wants you
And everybody wants you
And everybody wants you
And everybody wants you12Embed Stupid for You Double Dare Waterparks punk
