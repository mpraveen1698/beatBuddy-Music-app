18 ContributorsThrill Lyrics[Intro]
(How's your love life?)
Yo, look

[Verse 1]
Me and bro might hop out the four by four, we don't care about law, with the mask and gloves
Young bad boys, we're the realest ones, got the bad B showin' the whole gang love
Got more drinks than a bartender, G, I can't render when the vodka does
No sleep, fuck up the rave right now, got the girls all 'round tryna feel this buzz
Yo, got the girls all 'round tryna feel this wave
Never looked back when I saw that grave
No face, no case if you felt that brave
I can't lack, so I don't take train
And I can't see bro, can you feel this pain?
No stand up on the laughin' onе, tell her laugh off my back, that past in vain

[Chorus]
You don't know me, but you know my facе
And the whole gang fly like a paper plane
She loves the way I make her feel
Told bro, "Step on the gas, allez"
Blue lights at the back of the car, no way
But she loves the thrill
You don't know me, but you know my face (You don't know me, but you know my face)
And the whole gang fly like a paper plane
She loves the way I make her feel
Told bro, "Step on the gas, allez" (Told bro, "Step on the gas, allez")
Blue lights at the back of the car, no way
But she loves the thrill (But she loves the thrill, but she loves the thrill)

I got English girls and the Irish ones, G, I got more than three times two
Bad girls try show love to the crew then back their bumper, shit, they half get rude
And my bro got packs of the zoots, he's wrappin' up food like he's boxin' shoes
No cap rap, I'm a humble dude, but bro, he gets loose when the opps try move
I got lost in my brain back then, had to tame my pen, now the pad gets fried
Got no time for no vacant friends, I don't care about them, for my bros, I'll ride
He got nabbed when he thought he'd trialed and porky pies, we don't fuck with lies
I'm straight back in my feelings 'cause, yeah, I love this buzz 'til the day I die

[Bridge]
Et quand mon frère vendait la drogue, il me disait gros c'est la vie
Je fais que boire, je fume mes clopes et je pense aux belles mélodies
Et je te promets tous mes potes et tous mes frères ils m'ont dit
Qu'un jour je ferai le tour du monde, pour toute ma clique, ma famille

[Chorus]
You don't know me, but you know my face
And the whole gang fly like a paper plane
She loves the way I make her feel
Told bro, "Step on the gas, allez"
Blue lights at the back of the car, no way
But she loves the thrill
You don't know me, but you know my face (You don't know me, but you know my face)
And the whole gang fly like a paper plane
She loves the way I make her feel
Told bro, "Step on the gas, allez" (Told bro, "Step on the gas, allez")
Blue lights at the back of the car, no way
But she loves the thrill (But she loves the thrill, but she loves the thrill)
[Outro]
