That there
That's not me
I go
Where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey

[Chorus]
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

[Verse 2]
In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone

[Chorus]
And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

Strobe lights
And blowing speakers
Fireworks
And hurricanes

[Chorus]
I'm not here
This isn't happenin'
I'm not here
I'm not here
