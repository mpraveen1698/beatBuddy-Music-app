Woo! Woo

[Verse 1]
I'm ahead, I'm a man
I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah
I'm at peace with my lust
I can kill 'cause in God I trust, yeah

[Hook]
It's evolution, baby, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm at peace, I'm the man
Buyin' stocks on the day of the crash, yeah
On the loose, I'm a truck
All the rollin' hills, I'll flatten 'em out, yeah

[Hook]
It's herd behavior, uh huh
It's evolution, baby! Yeah

[Chorus 1]
Yeah
Admire me, admire my home
Admire my son, he's my clone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This land is mine, this land is free
I'll do what I want but irresponsibly

It's evolution, baby! Hey!

[Bridge]
I'm a thief, I'm a liar
There's my church, I sing in the choir:
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Chorus 2]
Admire me, admire my home
Admire my son, admire my clones
'Cause we know, appetite for a nightly feast
Those ignorant Indians got nothin' on me
Nothin', why? Because

[Hook]
It's evolution, baby!
Oh! Hey!

[Verse 3]
I am ahead, I am advanced!
I am the first mammal to make plans, yeah!
I crawled the earth, but now I'm higher
2010, watch it go to fire
[Hook]
It's evolution, baby! Ah!
It's evolution, baby! Hey!

[Outro]
Do the evolution!
Come on!
Come on, come on! Uh!
Uh!
