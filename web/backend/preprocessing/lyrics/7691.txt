8 ContributorsNeon Lyrics[Verse 1: Nico Sallach]
First sight, hard crush
Your touch, I wanna feel it day and night
Messed up too much
Thought about our first touch

[Chorus: Nico Sallach]
We were ready to fly
We were nothing but close to the sky
(Tell me)
Tell me the reason why you decide to push me away
Ready to fly
We were nothing but close to the sky
Ready to fly
Nothing but close to the sky

[Verse 2: Nico Sallach]
Break up, hard stuff
Fucked up
I wanna leave it all behind
New town, unknown
Restart and now I'm living on my own

[Chorus: Nico Sallach]
We were ready to fly
We were nothing but close to the sky
(Tell me)
Tell me the reason why you decide to push me away
We're ready to fly
We were nothing but close to the sky
Ready to fly
Nothing but close to the sky

We can't go back to
The time where it began
But I love to thank you
For the memories we share
Oh baby, we save the moments
The good, the bad ones
Remember you and me
Oh baby, we can't go back
No, I can't forget
That we were nothing but close to the sky

[Outro: Nico Sallach]
We can't go back to
(All I wanted was to be with you)
The time where it began
(No matter what you've put me through)
But I love to thank you
(All I wanted was to be with you)
That we were nothing but close to the sky

We can't go back to
(All I wanted was to be with you)
The time where it began
(No matter what you've put me through)
But I love to thank you
(All I wanted was to be with you)
That we were nothing but close to the sky
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ohEmbed Neon TEKKNO Electric Callboy metalcore
