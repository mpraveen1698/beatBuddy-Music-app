5 ContributorsShow Me Some Love LyricsI been around the block couple times
Yeah, film me when I walk in
Push in like a bass bin
I'm a whole vibration
Quake that earth
Gon' shake you down

This ain't no drill
This ain't no walkthrough for the groove
Give me your voodoo
Came on up from LA
Now I got honeys in the UK (Ooh)

Tell me how I don't miss
Tell me you can't handle it
Tell me that, that
That you need me
That you need me (Yeah)

The Jimmy Choo is what I choose
Can't be taboo
When I walk through
Oh girl

Show me some love
I ain't here for the drugs
Better show me some love
Yah
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
Better show me some love
(Diddle-diddle)

(Din-din, din-din)

Show me some love
I ain't here for the drugs
Better show me some love
Yah
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
Better show me some love
(Diddle-diddle)

Tell me that you exist (Tell me that you exist)
Tell me that you are opulent (Tell me that you are opulent)
Tell me that, te-te-
Tell me that
Ooh

Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
Better show me some love
The Jimmy Choo is what I choose
Can't be taboo
When I walk through (Din-din)
Oh girl
Show me some love
You better show me some love
