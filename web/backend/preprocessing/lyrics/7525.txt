1 ContributorEasy Lyrics[Chorus: Connor Price]
Drivin' on a sunset, top down
Stickin' to the old route uptown
If you're goin' my way, slow down
Easy, yeah
Drivin' on a good time, hop out
I know you've been cooped up, locked down
If you're goin' my way, slow down
Just take it easy, yeah

[Verse 1: Connor Price]
Notice how the best days always had no plans
And we don't need to trip to Rome for the romance
Make the most at home, cell phones closed, just hold hands
Lookin' for a food truck, maybe split a cold can of Pepsi
Ooh, you so refreshing
Glass half-full 'cause with you I'm never empty
Say it how it is so with you I'm never guessing
Ooh, I've been obsessing, hope you're in my story at the еnding
Hopin' that you'll be around, this is not a quick fling
This is not a rebound, this is not a quick thing
This is somethin' deep down, rеally, it's an instinct
Gotta keep it goin', is you with me?

[Chorus: Nic D]
Drivin' on a sunset, top down
Stickin' to the old route uptown
If you're goin' my way, slow down
Easy, yeah
Drivin' on a good time, hop out
I know you've been cooped up, locked down
If you're goin' my way, slow down
Just take it easy (Yeah)

And we don't gotta force it, watch your step, don't crease the Forces
We joined teams, we joined forces
This is not a home, less a castle, this is not a castle, this a fortress
Car might be domestic but the wine is still imported
Got you five hundred flowers, girl, I had to match the horses
You always put other people before ya
And you're always so supportive
It's only two doors, but I got that door for ya
I like what I like, baby (Oh-oh-oh)
I hope that's alright, baby (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm freein' you tonight, baby, yeah
I'm freein' you tonight, baby (Oh-oh-oh)
And I've been doin' front flips off the back porch
Go ahead and toss a ball off the backboard
And I'll take you anywhere that you ask for
Go ahead, pack a bag, get a passport

[Chorus: Connor Price & Nic D]
Drivin' on a sunset, top down
Stickin' to the old route uptown
If you're goin' my way, slow down
Easy, ee
Drivin' on a good time, hop out
I know you've been cooped up, locked down
If you're goin' my way, slow down
Just take it easy, yeahEmbed Easy Easy Connor Price;Nic D sad
