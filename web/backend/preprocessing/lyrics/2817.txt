Open Sesame (We've places to go)
We've people to see (Let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes that I bet you can make
When you want to escape, say the word

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you, I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie, but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move
And you'll probably be leaving soon, so I'm telling you

[Chorus]
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you

[Verse 2]
Eyes the colour of (Water left in mud)
Icing sugar dust (Crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?

[Chorus]
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie, and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both oughta put 'em on hold and I know you agree

[Chorus]
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
