5 ContributorsSame Place LyricsIt's the middle of the night, why don't you come through
Made a promise to myself that I wouldn't get back here with you
But things don't always work out how you want them to

So take me higher than the ceiling, oh
Just get me to that feeling, oh
Need that special healing, oh
Are you gonna come around
And now we're back at it again
I shouldn't have fallen so hard
Got me falling for the same things again
We're back here at the start
And now we're stuck here in the same place, we've already been here
Let's get back to my place, I don't want to be here
Don't wanna be alone tonight
You know that I hate being on my own
I know you know
Baby I wanna take you home, come on let's go
I don't wanna stay here

What happened to our situation
Been honest without a single conversation
And I'll admit you still bring me temptations

So take me higher than the ceiling, oh
Just get me to that feeling, oh
Need that special healing, oh
Are you gonna come around
And now we're back at it again
I shouldn't have fallen so hard
Got me falling for the same things again
We're back here at the start
And now we're stuck here in the same place, we've already been here
Let's get back to my place, I don't want to be here
Don't wanna be alone tonight
You know that I hate being on my own
I know you know
Baby I wanna take you home, come on let's go
I don't wanna stay hereYou might also likeEmbed Same Place Same Place JOY. electro
