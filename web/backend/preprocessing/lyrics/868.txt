Let's go, girls
Come on

[Verse 1]
I'm goin' out tonight
I'm feelin' alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise
Really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout

[Verse 2]
Ah, no inhibitions
Make no conditions
Get a little outta line
I ain't gonna act
Politically correct
I only wanna have a good time

[Pre-Chorus]
The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, go totally crazy
Forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh-oh-oh, really go wild, yeah
Doin' it in style
Oh-oh-oh, get in the action
Feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh-oh-oh, I wanna be free, yeah
To feel the way I feel
Man, I feel like a woman
