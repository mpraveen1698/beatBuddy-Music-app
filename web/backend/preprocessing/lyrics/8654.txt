I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now
Most of my days I spend alone
A thousand miles
From the place I was born
But when she wakes me
She takes me back home

[Verse]
Now, most days
I spend like a child
Who's afraid of ghosts in the night
I know there ain't nothing out there
I'm still afraid to turn on the lights

[Chorus]
I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now
Most of my days I spend alone
A thousand miles
The place I was born
When she wakes me
She takes me back home

[Verse]
A thousand miles
From the place I was born
When she wakes me
She takes me back home

Most of my days I spend alone
A thousand miles
From the place I was born
When she wakes me
She takes me
Yeah, when she wakes me
She takes me back home
When she wakes me
She takes me back homeEmbed Arms Of A Woman Amos Lee Amos Lee acoustic
