Lord, I come, I confess
Bowing here, I find my rest
Without You, I fall apart
You're the One that guides my heart

[Chorus]
Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

[Verse 2]
Where sin runs deep, Your grace is more
Where grace is found is where You are
And where You are, Lord, I am free
Holiness is Christ in me

[Chorus]
Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

[Bridge]
So teach my song to rise to You
When temptation comes my way
When I cannot stand, I'll fall on You
Jesus, You're my hope and stay
