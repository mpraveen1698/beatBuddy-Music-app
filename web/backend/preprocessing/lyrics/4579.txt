[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Pour out the bottle I wanna level up
When I'm with you, I never get enough
Slow whine I'm not in a rush
I can hear music when you're here
Tonight, we're rolling, party 'til closing
Since I put the ring on her finger it's still frozen
Love in slow motion
I wanna feel you over me, yeah
Somethin' magic in your eyes (eyes)
Girl, I love the way you ride it (ride it)
And it happens every time you arrive, that's right
Girl, I want you in my life (my life)
If there's a heaven then it's right here (right here)
I will never leave your side, stay tonight, tonight (tonight)

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
When you want see me, when you want see me
I'm in West London this evening
Givin' me the feelings, no I'm not leavin'
Until I fly LA next weekend
Peru, nah, girl, I'd rather go find somewhere quiet
You'll glow, and I'll get lost here in your eyes
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Omoge no be so
Girl, you just capture my soul
Omoge no be so
Make me wanna just take you home
Peru para, peru, peru para
I'm loo, even peru don dey para
(Peru para, peru, peru para)
(I'm loo, even peru don dey para)
(Peru para, peru, peru para)
(I'm loo, even peru don dey pa)Embed Peru - R3HAB Remix Peru (R3HAB Remix) Fireboy DML;Ed Sheeran;R3HAB dancehall
