We had a great day
Even though we forgot to eat
And you had a bad dream
And we got no sleep
'Cause we were kissing

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
I had a fever
Until I met you
Now you make me cool
But sometimes I still do
Somethin' embarrassing

[Chorus: All]
I never said I'd be alright
Just thought I could hold myself together
When I couldn't breathe, I went outside
Don't know why I thought it'd be any better
I'm fine now, it doesn't matter
I didn't wanna be this guy
I cried at your show with the teenagers
Tell your friend I'll be alright
In the morning, it won't matter
I wanna be emaciated
I wanna hear one song without thinkin' of you
I wish I was on a spaceship
Just me and my dog and an impossible view
