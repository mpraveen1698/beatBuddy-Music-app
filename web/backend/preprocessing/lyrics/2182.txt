6 ContributorsSomebody Like That Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've seen pick-up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance
I've seen happy hour two-for-ones turn to one-night stands
I've seen neon rebounds
And late-night drunk dials

[Verse 2]
I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke
I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke
The real thing won't be easy
Yeah, it might take a while

[Chorus]
But I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what, if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

[Verse 3]
I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile, "That's my girl right there"
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth is
You might also like[Chorus]
To get to that that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what, if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

[Bridge]
I've had some real close calls, a couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not

[Chorus]
And I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what, if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that

[Outro]
Somebody like that
Mm, somebody like that
Love somebody like thatEmbed Somebody Like That Love, Heartbreak, & Everything in Between Tenille Arts country
