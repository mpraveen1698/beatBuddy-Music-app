Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams, become a taboo
I don't want to be afraid, the deeper that I go
It takes my breath away, soft hearts, electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes, is this taboo?

[Chorus]
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place, in your house of memories

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I think of you from time to time more than I thought I would
You were just too kind and I was too young to know
That's all that really matters, I was a fool
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Those thoughts of past lovers, they'll always haunt me
I wish I could believe you'd never wrong me
Then will you remember me in the same way as I remember you?

[Chorus]
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories
[Post-Chorus]
