Crybaby, serial heartbreaker
Don't blame me, it's just the way God made her

[Verse 1]
So many questions
That's too many for me
So many lessons
So many girl-of my-dreams
'Cause I tend to overcomplicate
I overlove, I underplay
I get myself in situations
Different people, different places
Sensitive, but not enough
I'm not the best at breakin' up
Too soon to rip the Band-Aid off
A sucker for the fuck me up

[Chorus]
Crybaby, serial heartbreakеr (Ah)
Don't blame me, it's just the way God madе her (Ah)
(Woah) Serial heartbreaker
(Oh) It's just the way, it's just the way God made her

[Verse 2]
I like my alone time
But I want somebody to hold
I get what I want, I
I keep it for a minute, then I let it go
'Cause I tend to contradict a lot
I love you more, I love you not
I hate it when you're there for me
I like it when you hit the spot
And every time I share too much
You get in close and I give up
So hurry, rip the Band-Aid off
Hurry, baby, fuck me up
