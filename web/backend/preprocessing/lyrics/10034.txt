Dreamstate

[Verse 1]
Always told me to keep you close
The feeling's fading when you're a ghost
I dream of colors that light your face
But real life showed me it takes away

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every time I wake up
I'm waiting for a miracle
And maybe when the night comes
I'll find you in another world

[Chorus]
So how do I live in a dreamstate?
When nothing is real when I'm awake
The sun rises but I know I'm afraid
I'm living in a dreamstate

[Verse 2]
Death played victim through hide and seek
You felt its cold touch when you were weak
Your soul departed, the sky turned blue
But when I'm sleeping, I talk with you

[Chorus]
So how do I live in a dreamstate?
When nothing is real when I'm awake
The sun rises but I know I'm afraid
I'm living in a dreamstate

[Breakdown]
Cause every time I wake up
I'm waiting for a miracle

I can try but it blinds when I walk through hell
Now my dream's a reminder

I know that nothing is real
Nothing is real
Nothing is real
Nothing is real
No, the pain won't erase, I can not wake

[Chorus]
So how do I live in a dreamstate?
When nothing is real when I'm awake
The sun rises but I know i'm afraid
I'm living in a dreamstate
The sun rises but I know i'm afraid
I'm living in a dreamstate
