Turmoil at the front
Wilhelm's forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's when the dead men are marching again

[Chorus]
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again

[Verse 2]
Two combatants spar
Hindenburg against the Tsar
Move in 12 battalions large
Into a Russian counter-charge
They'll be fighting for their lives
As their enemy revives
Russians won't surrender, no
Striking fear into their foe
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And that's when the dead men are marching again

[Chorus]
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again

[Guitar solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's when the dead men are marching again

[Chorus]
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again
[Outro]
Osowiec then and again
(That's when the dead men are marching again and again)
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
(That's when the dead marched again)
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again11Embed The Attack of the Dead Men The Great War Sabaton swedish
