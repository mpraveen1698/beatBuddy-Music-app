I'm a sailor peg, and I've lost my leg
Climbing up the top sails, I lost my leg

[Chorus]
I'm shipping up to Boston, whoa
I'm shipping up to Boston, whoa
I'm shipping up to Boston, whoa
I'm shipping off to find my wooden leg

[Verse]
I'm a sailor peg, and I've lost my leg
Climbing up the top sails, I lost my leg

[Chorus]
I'm shipping up to Boston, whoa
I'm shipping up to Boston, whoa
I'm shipping up to Boston, whoa
I'm shipping off to find my wooden legSee Dropkick Murphys LiveGet tickets as low as $63You might also like16Embed I'm Shipping Up To Boston The Warrior's Code Dropkick Murphys ska
