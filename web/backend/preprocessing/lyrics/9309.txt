1 ContributorI fought the law - single version LyricsA-breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and I feel so sad
I guess my race is run
Well, she's the best girl I've ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

A-robbin' people with a six-gun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I miss my baby and-a good fun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
Well, she's the best girl I've ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law wonYou might also likeEmbed I Fought the Law - Single Version Never To Be Forgotten - The Mustang Years The Bobby Fuller Four garage
