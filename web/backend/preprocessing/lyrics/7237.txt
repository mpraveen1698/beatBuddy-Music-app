16 ContributorsI and Love and You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Load the car and write the note
Grab your bag and grab your coat
Tell the ones that need to know
We are headed north
One foot in and one foot back
It don't pay to live like that
So I cut the ties and I jumped the tracks
For never to return

[Chorus]
Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
Are you aware the shape I'm in?
My hands, they shake, my head, it spins
Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in

[Verse 2]
When at first I learned to speak
I used all my words to fight
With him and her and you and me
Oh, but it's just a waste of time
It's such a waste of time
That woman she's got eyes that shine
Like a pair of stolen polished dimes
She asked to dance I said it's fine
I'll see you in the morning time

Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
Are you aware the shape I'm in?
My hands, they shake, my head, it spins
Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in

[Bridge]
Three words that became hard to say
I and love and you
What you were then, I am today
Look at the things I do

[Chorus]
Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
Are you aware the shape I'm in?
My hands, they shake, my head, it spins
Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in

Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
Are you aware the shape I'm in? (Oh!)
My hands, they shake, my head, it spins (spins)
Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in

[Verse 3]
Dumbed down and numbed by time and age
The dreams the catch, the world the cage
The highway sets the traveler's stage
All exits look the same
[Outro]
Three words that became hard to say
I and love and you
I and love and you
I and love and you5Embed I And Love And You I And Love And You The Avett Brothers bluegrass
