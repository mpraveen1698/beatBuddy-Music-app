We could hide away in daylight
We go undercover, wait out the sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty, that's where we run

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday people do everyday things, but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind
We can do anything

[Chorus]
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Anybody's got the power
They don't see it 'cause they don't understand
Spinnin' 'round and 'round for hours
You and me, we got the world in our hands

We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you

[Chorus]
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you

[Bridge]
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light
We could be
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light
