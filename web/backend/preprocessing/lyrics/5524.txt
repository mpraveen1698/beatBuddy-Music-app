(MKAY)

[Hook]
Man these streets are cold, but the girls heart was even colder
Let's see how a next man walks if he's carrying half of my pain on his shoulders
True say that this life was hard, and that's the reason that most of us smokers
Lately, yeah my thoughts exploding hold on, can you give me a moment

[Verse 1]
See I thought that girl was golden but deep down she was cold and broken
Don't want a repeat of last time, best know that I gotta stay woke then
See this wasn't part of my plan, I looked at two years in the can
And I though fuck that, that's not who I am
I got Mumzy driving me mad and now I think back that life was just sad
That life was just fuckery
And, that life was just whack
And I can't lie I would do so many things to hug those I can't bring back
And thе moment I stepped of track I was in a T-Housе serving those cats, got to much to loose so I can't go back
Man, I swear that I won't go back
(I don't know though man like, Just got me in my feels you know what I'm sayin'?)
(Ight listen bro, Fuck that girl. I got you My guy.)
(Haha Come on)

[Verse 2]
Man I swear that I won't go back
But, I'm running and running and running again try to keep up with half a grand
And if you stop wearing half the brands, and stick to your lane, then start to plan
You might get somewhere in this broken world, where they say I can't but I can
And ever since all this love began, I've changed as a fucking man
Back day we used to rap outside council flats, go halves on a gram
And then we step to the shops in the evening, bare leaning, the zoots got us licked
Back day man that block was a heater, so flames, I gotta lay low no stitch
Fuck that girl she's frozen gold
