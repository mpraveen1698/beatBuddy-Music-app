[Verse 1]
Let me take you to the place
Where membership's a smiling face
Brush shoulders with the stars
Where strangers take you by the hand
And welcome you to wonderland
From beneath their panamas

[Chorus]
Club Tropicana, drinks are free
Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone
All that's missing is the sea
But don't worry, you can suntan

[Verse 2]
Castaways and lovers meet
Then kiss in Tropicana's heat
Watch the waves break on the bay
Oh, soft white sands, a blue lagoon
Cocktail time, a summer's tune
A whole night's holiday

[Chorus]
Club Tropicana, drinks are free
Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone
All that's missing is the sea
But don't worry, you can suntan
You might also like[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Club Tropicana, drinks are free
Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone
All that's missing is the sea
But don't worry, you can suntan

[Bridge]
Pack your bags and leave tonight
Don't take your time, gotta move your feet
Don't you miss the flight
Pack your bags and leave tonight
Don't take your time, gotta move your feet
Don't you miss the flight!
(Cool, cool, cool, cool)

[Chorus]
Club Tropicana, drinks are free
Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone
All that's missing is the sea
But don't worry, you can suntan

[Outro]
(Cool, cool, cool, cool
Cool, cool, cool, cool)3Embed Club Tropicana Fantastic Wham! synth-pop
