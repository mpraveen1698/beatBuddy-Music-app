3 ContributorsCreep Lyrics[Verse 1]
Went away before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so very special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
I went out of control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to know that
When I'm not around
I wish I was special
You're so very special
You might also like[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

[Outro]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong hereEmbed Creep Creep GAMPER & DADONI deep-house
