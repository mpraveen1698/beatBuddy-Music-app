4 ContributorsSummer&Cigarettes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Summer days and cigarettes
Say you don't have no regrets, but
You gon' regret that tomorrow
Underpaid and overstressed
Apartment clean, but life's a mess
Finding a lesson in lost hope
'Cause you been drinking out the bottle
Losing track of time
Curved just like a model
But you're always doing lines
Got your hand up on a throttle
90 in a 25
Girl, slow it down
You won't make it out alive

[Chorus]
City lights and conversations
People you don't like
Wasting nights in strangers' basements
Say you're doing fine
Pretty eyes arе always vacant
Maybe it's a sign
Just 'cause you're a star
No, it doеsn't mean you shine

Summer days and cigarettes
Say you don't have no regrets, but
You gon' regret that tomorrow
Underpaid and overstressed
Apartment clean, but life's a mess
Finding a lesson in lost hope (Oh, oh)
Staying up and sleeping late
Say you're done and leave LA
Every day, the same thing, girl
I don't think you could ever change
No, you were never mine
You belong to every guy
I see the truth, but you're blinded by the pretty lights

[Chorus]
City lights and conversations
People you don't like
Wasting nights in strangers' basements
Say you're doing fine
Pretty eyes are always vacant
Maybe it's a sign
Just 'cause you're a star
No, it doesn't mean you shine

[Chorus]
City lights and conversations
People you don't like
Wasting nights in strangers' basements
Say you're doing fine
Pretty eyes are always vacant
Maybe it's a sign
Just 'cause you're a star
No, it doesn't mean you shineEmbed summer&cigarettes summer&cigarettes sammy rash sad
