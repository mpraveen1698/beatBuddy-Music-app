10 ContributorsOvercome Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't cry victim to me
Everything we are and used to be
Is buried and gone
Now it's my turn to speak
It's my turn to expose and release
What's been killing me
I'll be damned fighting you
It's impossible, impossible
Say goodbye with no sympathy

[Chorus]
I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned, I'm numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain, I can't feel no more
I'm entitled to overcome
Overcome

[Verse 2]
Finally see what's beneath
Everything I am and hope to be
Cannot be lost
I'll be damned fighting you
You're impossible, impossible
Say goodbye with no sympathy

I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned, I'm numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain, I can't feel no more
I'm entitled to overcome
Overcome

[Bridge]
(Overcome)
You'll never know what I was thinking before you came 'round
Take a step, take a breath, put your guard down
(Overcome)
I cannot worry anymore of what you think of me
I may be crazy, but I'm buried in your memory

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned, I'm numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain, I can't feel no more

[Outro]
(Look in my eyes)
I'm entitled to overcome
(I'll fight 'til I die)
Completely stunned, I'm numb
(Look in my eyes)
I'm entitled to overcome
(I'll fight 'til I die)
Completely stunned, I'm numb
I'm entitled to overcome
I may be crazy, but I'm buried in your memory4Embed Overcome Full Circle Creed grunge
