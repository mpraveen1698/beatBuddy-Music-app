14 ContributorsFaster Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't sleep 'cause it's burning deep inside
Like gasoline on a fire running wild
No more fear 'cause I'm getting closer now
So unreal but I like it anyhow

[Pre-Chorus]
I go faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster

[Chorus]
And I can't live in a fairytale of lies
And I can't hide from the feeling 'cause it's right
And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for life
I can't live in a fairytale of lies

[Verse 2]
I can feel that you mesmerise my heart
I feel so free, I'm alive, I'm breaking out
I won't give in, 'cause I'm proud of all my scars
And I can see I've been wasting too much time

[Pre-Chorus]
I go faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster

[Chorus]
And I can't live in a fairytale of lies
And I can't hide from the feeling 'cause it's right
And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for life
I can't live in a fairytale of lies
