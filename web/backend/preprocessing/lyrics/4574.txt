Success is (Funkula), all I want

Oh-oh, mo la ka o

[Refrain: Burna Boy]

[Chorus: Burna Boy]
Mm, dem dey pray, make I fall and stagger
So I move in, cloak and dagger
Might see me in a black bandana
In a Lambo' with Jowi Zaza
Diamond teeth with a pocket full of rabba
No shirt, nigga, looking like I'm a robber
Since I start, dem dey carry my matter
No be now ,we go scatter my dada (Huhn)

[Refrain: Burna Boy]
Oti pe n'be
Shey 'be le ma sun

Yeah, yo
Thеm dey pray we go fall and stagger
Arе you mad? You know why dem man call me Baba?
To catch eye, you gon need one bigger and a taller ladder (Big one)
Just there dancing, dagger
I'm outside chilling, ragga
What's all the higgy hagger?
When I come with the Ninki Nanka (Big one)
Now my jacket was shining like Bianca
Now dem man there wish they never done that (What?)
Now everybody Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder
Niggas doing 8 mile when they hear the thunder
Make a nigga wake up, rise from your slumber
I ain't even green yet, man, I'm still on amber
Why you wanna see me fall down, see me under?
Sometimes I gotta think hard, and I ponder
They can come close, come here but they want to
Just stay far, stay there, smoke your ganja (Okay, okay, okay)
Twenty-four hours ain't enough for gangster (Nah)
No sleep, now my eyes looking like a panda
Do dem man dere really wanna pass a passer? (What?)
When we pull up, they gon' have to go and call for Jah Jah
Go and call for Yah Allah
See, me ah marga
When your time has come, nigga, don't make it harder
Can't catch him today, we gon' see tomorrow
Only witness was Tia Tamera
[Chorus: Burna Boy]
Them dey pray, make I fall and stagger
So I move in, cloak and dagger
Might see me in a black bandana
In a Lambo' with Jowi Zaza
Diamond teeth with a pocket full of rabba
No shirt, nigga, looking like I'm a robber
Since I start, dem dey carry my matter
No be now, we go scatter my dada, huh
Them dey pray, make I fall and stagger
So I move in, cloak and dagger
Might see me in a black bandana
In a Lambo' with Jowi Zaza
Diamond teeth with a pocket full of rabba
No shirt, nigga, looking like I'm a robber
Since I start, dem dey carry my matter
No be now, we go scatter my dada
