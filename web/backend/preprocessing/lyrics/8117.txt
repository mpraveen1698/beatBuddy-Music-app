Celluloid soldiers, come in from the rain
Murder my smile, but please, leave me my pain
All those good people, they don't even try
Stealing the truth while they pay for your lie
I'm about to lose the things I never saw before
You wanted me to know the ups and downs
Away we go to get another hit, the it
The blood that she's about to spit
You go your way and I guess I'll go mine
We'll both arrive at the vеry same time

[Bridge]
Pleasе, give me your tired, give me your poor
Please, lift up your lamp, walk through this door

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Kick down the doors that you don't understand
Please, don't lose sight of this generous plan
Blinded by prisms, we wind up in court
I'm folding chairs while you sold yourself short
She's about to redefine the way
Reminded me to say the other way was right
She's in a place to pray for me
And now we've got to flash the funky light-a
You've got your way and it seems I've got mine
Both gonna die at the very same time

Marry me, mama, that's someone to carry me home
Stick with me, girlfriend, I don't want to be here alone
Marry me, mama, that's someone to carry me home
