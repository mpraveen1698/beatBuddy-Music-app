3 ContributorsTomorrow Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's a cold world, but I'm alright
I got you, I got you to keep me warm like
Like a long drag off the last hit
If you're the new pack, then I just can't quit

[Pre-Chorus]
I spend too much time
All my time worryin' 'bout yesterday and
I've spent all my life
Hopin' things would stay the same

[Chorus]
Baby, everything could change
In the middle of the night, so
If we make it through today
Say you'll stay with me tomorrow
Knowing you could slip away
Is the hardest pill to swallow
So if we make it through today
Say you'll stay with me tomorrow
Tomorrow

[Verse 2]
It's that old car, it's that dark drive
Lookin' back, back on you, you're the streetlights
And if the hands turn, if they don't wait
Tell me this won't burn out when the moon fades
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I spеnd too much time
All my time worryin' 'bout yestеrday and
I've spent all my life
Hopin' things would stay the same

[Chorus]
Baby, everything could change
In the middle of the night, so
If we make it through today
Say you'll stay with me tomorrow
Knowing you could slip away
Is the hardest pill to swallow
So if we make it through today
Say you'll stay with me tomorrow
Tomorrow

[Chorus]
Baby, everything could change
In the middle of the night, so
If we make it through today
Say you'll stay with me tomorrow
Knowing you could slip away
Is the hardest pill to swallow
So if we make it through today
Say you'll stay with me tomorrow
