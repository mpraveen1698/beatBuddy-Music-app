From the eye, we're not similar
We make love anyway
Mesh well like colorway
Mm, when I'm down
Love me anyway
We take well to each other like colorway
(Mesh well, mesh well, oh-oh, mm)
Even when colors fade away
The domain's the same
Two different shades, different shades like colorway

[Outro]
(Two different shades, different shades)
(Different shades like colorway)
(Different shades)
