4 ContributorsStranger Things (Alan Walker Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight

[Verse 1]
We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out?
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We left a life
That's ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now

[Chorus]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there

Someday
Someday

[Verse 2]
I see a Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We turned our back on ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Show me the sky falling down

[Chorus]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in an ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get there
[Break]
Someday
Someday

[Outro]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in an ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get there2Embed Stranger Things (feat. OneRepublic) - Alan Walker Remix Kids in Love (Remixes) Kygo;OneRepublic;Alan Walker house
