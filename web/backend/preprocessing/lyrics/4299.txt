26 Contributors45 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Send away for a priceless gift
One not subtle, one not on the list
Send away for a perfect world
One not simply so absurd
In these times of doing what you're told
Keep these feelings, no one knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever happened to the young man's heart?
Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

[Chorus]
And I'm starin' down the barrel of a .45 (.45)
Swimmin' through the ashes of another life (Another life)
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Starin' down the barrel of a .45

[Verse 2]
Send a message to the unborn child
"Keep your eyes open, for a while
In a box high up on the shelf
Left for you, no one else
There's a piece of a puzzle known as life
Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight"

[Bridge]
Everyone's pointing their fingers
Always condemning me
And nobody knows what I believe
I believe

[Chorus]
And I'm starin' down the barrel of a .45 (.45)
Swimmin' through the ashes of another life (Another life)
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Starin' down the barrel of a .45
And I'm starin' down the barrel of a .45 (Woah)
And I'm swimmin' through the ashes of another life (Woah)
There is no real reason to accept the way things have changed (Woah)
Starin' down the barrel of a .45 (.45)
