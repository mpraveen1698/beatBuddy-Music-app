4 ContributorsRoom for you Lyrics[Caleb Hearn]
Sometimes I wake up
Can't remember how to breathe
I wish you were there with me
Sometimes I wake up
Can't remember what I dreamed
But I hope it was you and me

Can't see your face
Without wanting it too
So far away
But I keep room for you
Love ain't a place
Its the things that we do
It's pulling me right back to you

I'm not okay
But I'll be just fine
Got days to waste
If its you on my mind
I'm not afraid
I'll just follow the signs
They're pulling me right back to you

[Caleb Hearn, sad alex]
Sometimes I wake up
Can't remember how to brеathe
And I wish you were thеre with me
Sometimes I wake up
Can't remember what I dreamed
But I hope it was you and me
You might also like[sad alex]
I was a mess
Now I know what I want
That morning text
And you'll love till its gone
If I could make
Make you hold me in your arms
Holding me right next to you

Sometimes I wake up
Can't remember how to breathe
And I wish you were there with me
Sometimes I wake up
Can't remember what I dreamed
But I hope it was you and me

You and me
Ooh
You and me
Ooh
Yeah I hope it was you and me
Ooh

Can't see your face
Without wanting it too
So far away
But I keep room for you
So far away
But I keep room for youEmbed room for you room for you sad alex;Caleb Hearn indie
