23 ContributorsPsycho! Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
I might just go psycho
Too many drunk white hoes

[Chorus]
I might just go psycho
Too many drunk white hoes
Said I won't but I might though
Walking on the tight rope
Do it just in spite though
Backwoods got my eyes low
I might just go psycho
Backwoods had my eyes low

[Verse 1]
I just left in the Porsche
I'm moving too fast, I cannot slow it down
On my way to the morgue
I'm dying young if I don't slow it down
Too much cash in the bag
I'm burning it all, nothing can stop me now
Gave you one more chance
You lost that shit and you just lost a crown
Said she loved me, but she lied though (Lied though)
No evidence is severed in your lies though (Lies though)
But I knew quick, grew up, lose shit
Change my mind, I don't lose bitch
I go blind, psychic, I just knew it
I waste my time, I can't move
It's making me go blind to this new shit
I'm so clueless, saying this is old news (Old news)
But you're not new, you're old news (Old news)

Backwoods got my eyes low
I might just go psycho
Backwoods had my eyes low

[Verse 2]
Spend my money where my time goes
I got an ounce like those
Focus on my cash flowing
Enlightened feel like Osho
Up all night, I'm on the road
See me, they take photos, photos

[Pre-Chorus]
I might just go psycho
Too many drunk white hoes
[Chorus]
I might just go psycho
Too many drunk white hoes
Said I won't but I might though
Walking on the tight rope
Do it just in spite though
Backwoods got my eyes low
I might just go psycho
Backwoods had my eyes low

[Outro]
I might just go psycho
Up all night, I'm on the road
Enlightened feel like Osho
Too many drunk white hoes
I might just go psycho
I'm so psycho for you
I might just go psycho
Too many drunk white hoes
