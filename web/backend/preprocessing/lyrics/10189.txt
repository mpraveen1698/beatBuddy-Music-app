1 ContributorLosing You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me darling now how the hell
Did I let the time slip away so fast
I've been drowning in troubled waters
Trying to make a fleeting feeling last
I know that the sun gonna rise in the morning
Bringing a brand new fear to my worried mind
I don't need any sympathy
I just wanna make things right with you and I 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't tell me no lies
Girl I see through the smile you're faking
I just can't take it
(No)
And I'm well aware of it
Niggas wanna be in love for the hell of it
You're what they're chasing
I have to face it

[Chorus]
Girl, I've been up all night just
Running it through my mind, yeah
How could I be so blind lately?
Am I losing you baby?
Girl, I've been up all night just
Trying to make wrong things right
Feelings that I just can't hide lately
Am I losing you baby?

Seven-thirty, alone again
Baby girl you treat me just like a friend
I don't need an apology
Just to hide the truth under a lie again
I know that the feeling comes in a moment
Watching the whole thing crumble before my eyes
I don't need you to fight with me
I just wanna make things right with you and I 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't tell me no lies
Girl I see through the smile you're faking
I just can't take it
(Oh no)
I'm well aware of it
Niggas wanna be in love for the hell of it
You're what they're chasing
I have to face it

[Chorus]
Girl, I've been up all night just
Running it through my mind, yeah
How could I be so blind lately?
Am I losing you baby?
Girl, I've been up all night just
Trying to make wrong things right
Feelings that I just can't hide lately
Am I losing you baby?
[Bridge]
(Am I losing you baby?)
(Am I losing you baby?)
I'll take my time I'll do this right
(Am I losing you baby?)
I'll leave the lies inside my mind
(Am I losing you baby?)

[Chorus]
Girl, I've been up all night just
Running it through my mind, yeah
How could I be so blind lately?
Am I losing you baby?
Girl, I've been up all night just
Trying to make wrong things right
Feelings that I just can't hide lately
Am I losing you baby?Embed Losing You Borderline Christian Kuria chill
