20 ContributorsNever Tear Us Apart Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't ask me what you know is true
Don't have to tell you, oh, I love your precious heart

[Chorus]
I was standing, you were there
Two worlds collide
And they could never, ever tear us apart

[Verse 2]
And we could live for a thousand years
But if I hurt you, I'd make wine from your tears
Oh, I told you that we could fly
'Cause we all have wings, but some of us don't know why

[Chorus]
I was standing, you were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart, oh, oh, oh
And they could never, ever tear us apart, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I was standing, you were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart
Tear us apart, oh woah
And they could never, ever tear us apartYou might also like5Embed Never Tear Us Apart Fifty Shades Freed (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Bishop Briggs alt-rock
