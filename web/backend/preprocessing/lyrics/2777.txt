19 ContributorsNumbers Lyrics[Verse]
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say
My mind is killing me
These numbers aren't going straight up
Maybe if I talk about some things I don't really wanna talk about
I'll make some money and I'll go on tour
So I don't have to go to school anymore
Things just really aren't that bad
I got a nice mom and I got a cool dad
I just stay in my room too long
But I finally got a girlfriend and she's the bomb
