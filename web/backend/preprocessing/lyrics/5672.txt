7 ContributorsFront Porch Lyrics[Verse 1]
There are no wrong roads
And no window stays closed
And love is always sad when it fades
But glass is better stained anyways

[Chorus]
If never you find what you’re looking for
Come on back to the front porch
Say my name through the screen door
Come on back to the front porch
Whatever you’ve done, it doesn’t matter
'Cause darling we're all a little splintered and battered
But the light is on, what you waiting for?
Come on back, come on back to the front porch

[Verse 2]
We carved a story in these boards
Watching life go back and forth
You take it all for granted, then you leave
And then it takes a while to realize what you need

[Chorus]
If never you find what you’re looking for
Come on back to the front porch
Say my name through the screen door
Come on back to the front porch
Whatever you’ve done, it doesn’t matter
'Cause darling we're all a little splintered and battered
But the light is on, what you waiting for?
Come on back, come on back

I took the long way
Looking for the shortcut
To find out that this place
Was made of the best of

[Chorus]
If never you find what you’re looking for
Come on back to the front porch
Say my name through the screen door
Oh, come on back to the front porch
Whatever you’ve done, it doesn’t matter
'Cause darling we're all a little splintered and battered
But the light is on, what you waiting for?
Come on back, come on back
Oh, come on back, come on back to the front porch1Embed Front Porch Front Porch Joy Williams acoustic
