Can I, can I tell you a secret? Yeah
Girl, you brighten up my world
Say you love me like you mean it, yeah
Girl, I wanna hear you say it
Can't you tell I want you by my side?
So do you mind?
It's late, but let's take one more drive
Just you and I

[Chorus]
We're gone with the wind
Hair in your face
Put my hand on your waist
Strawberry skies all on your lips
'Cause I love how it taste
Hope that you catch me when I fall
No warning at all
When I'm not with you, I go through withdrawals
We're gone with the wind
Hair in your face
Put my hand on your waist
Strawberry skies all on your lips
'Cause I love how it taste
Hope that you catch me when I fall
No warning at all
When I'm not with you, I go through withdrawals (Oh)

Babe, you know when it gets late, yeah
I'll be fiending for your taste
I'll pull you closer, grab your waist
And never let you go

[Bridge]
Can't you tell I want you by my side?
Like, do you mind?
It's late, but let's take one more drive
Just you and I

[Chorus]
We're gone with the wind
Hair in your face
Put my hand on your waist
Strawberry skies all on your lips
'Cause I love how it taste
Hope that you catch me when I fall
No warning at all
When I'm not with you, I go through withdrawals
Oh, we're gone with the wind
Hair in your face
Put my hand on your waist
Strawberry skies all on your lips
'Cause I love how it taste
Hope that you catch me when I fall
No warning at all
When I'm not with you, I go through withdrawals
We're gone with the wind
Hair in your face
Put my hand on your waist
Strawberry skies all on your lips
'Cause I love how it taste
Hope that you catch me when I fall
No warning at all
When I'm not with you, I go through withdrawals5Embed Strawberry Skies Strawberry Skies Kid Travis chill
