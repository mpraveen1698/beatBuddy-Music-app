You know what she said to me?

[Verse 1]
She said, "You're a player, aren't you?
And I bet you got hoes"
I said, "You don't know me like that
I just go with the flow, oh, oh"
She said, "You can't fool me like that
You're gonna leave me on read"
I said, "Why don't you try me on out?
I know you wanna be friends"

[Pre-Chorus]
But friends turn into sleepovers
And sleepovers turn into love
Love turns into jealousy
And now we both fucked up

[Chorus]
'Cause we're stuck in the middle of lovers and friends
And we're losing every part of the benefits
You hurt me more than I ever knew
But it's shitty 'cause I'm doing the same to you

[Verse 2]
She said, "Are we exclusive or not?" (Exclusive or not)
I said, "What do you wanna do?
Seems like you love me a lot" (Seems like you love me a lot)
She said, "Can we stop the joking
And take me seriously?" (Take me seriously)
I said, "I'll try my very best
But we'll have to wait and see" (Let's wait and see)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause talks turn into sleepless nights
And sleepless nights turn into love (Turn into love)
Love turns into impatience
And now we both fucked up (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
'Cause we're stuck in the middle of lovers and friends (Lovers and friends)
And we're losing every part of the benefits (Losing benefits)
You hurt me more than I ever knew (Than I ever knew)
But it's shitty 'cause I'm doing the same to you

[Bridge]
Stuck in the middle
Stuck in the middle with you (Hey, hey)
Stuck in the middle (Stuck in the middle)
Stuck in the middle with you (Hey, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
Because fights turn into making up
And making up turns into love (Turns into love)
Love turns into forever (Forever)
And that scares both of us (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
'Cause we're stuck in the middle of lovers and friends (Lovers and friends)
And we're losing every part of the benefits (Hey, hey)
You hurt me more than I ever knew
But it's shitty 'cause I'm doing the same to you8Embed Stuck In The Middle TV Tai Verdes indie-pop
