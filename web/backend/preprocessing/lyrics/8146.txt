You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone

[Chorus]
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

[Verse 2]
Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please, let's forget my past
The future looks bright ahead

[Chorus]
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

[Refrain]
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of

[Verse 3]
Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
C'mon over here and love me
You know what I want you to say

And let us say "I do"
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you

[Chorus]
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

[Refrain]
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of
