Gbe mi trabaye, make you no dey shalaye
I don't want nobody to give my matter K-leg
For this life I dey, I want to be celebrated
Don't wanna waste my days, I want to spend them on enjoyment

[Post-Chorus]
It's plenty, oh, ah
Order Hennessy, oh, ah
Won ni won wa mi o, ah
Every day, party, ah

[Verse 1]
As I dey knack the gbedu
Start to dey move, start to dey move like you smoke kalaku
Just dey bounce with the groove, no carry do
If you lose guard, dem go bounce with your boo
I can vouch for my crew, I'm tellin' you
Them too dey do, lifestyle of a crook
Make you dance, no dey look
Dem go dey look, dem go dey look
Then say if it's not enough
If I do ninety-nine good e go remain one
Don't know how to show you my love without fuckin' up
But I can buy you a new AP straight from A Jewellers (Cap, zobo)

It's plenty, oh, ah

[Verse 2]
Do me like I take Tramadol
Don't want to feel nothing at all (Okay)
Be like Ojuju Calabar
Give me moral like I be bouncer
Mon para gan (Leggo)
Take me high, I don't want to land, oh
Up till now, I don't understand why
No matter what I do, it's not enough
If I do ninety-nine good e go remain one
Don't know how to show you my love without fuckin' up
Wallahi, I'm faded, just dey shake head
Forget di label
[Chorus]
Gbe mi trabaye, make you no dey shalaye (No dey shalaye)
I don't want nobody to give my matter K-leg (Give my matter K-leg)
For this life I dey, I want to be celebrated
Don't wanna waste my days, I want to spend them on enjoyment
Gbe mi trabaye, make you no dey shalaye
I don't want nobody to give my matter K-leg
For this life I dey, I want to be celebrated
Don't wanna waste my days, I want to spend them on enjoyment (Spend them on enjoyment)
