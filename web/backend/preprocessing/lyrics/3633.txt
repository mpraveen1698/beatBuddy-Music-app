13 Contributors​don’t miss me Lyrics[Intro]
Check one, check two, check one, check two
And I'm gonna start singing right now

[Verse 1]
Feelin' kinda nervous, startin' things, not really like me
Got a boyfriend, says he likes me, guess I like him, but it's funny
'Cause I'm not big on relationships, I'm more down for the flirt
All my friends say it's a problem, I'd just rather not get hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't take my feelings and I can't trust my heart
So I never take my chances 'cause I know I'll break apart

[Chorus]
Buh-duh-duh-duh, buh-duh-duh
I hate the mushy shit, and
Buh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh
I tell it how it is, and
Boom, buh-duh-duh, duh-duh
I wish that I was kiddin' but I'm not good at listening
So I don't want someone missin' me

[Verse 2]
I'm so unpredictable, onе day, I'm irresistible
The nеxt, I hate myself, never good for someone else
So I try to stay away, don't want them dealing with my brain
But suddenly he's got me folding 'cause I only want him to hold me, yuck but
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take my feelings and I can't trust my heart
So I never take my chances 'cause I know I'll break apart

[Chorus]
Buh-duh-duh-duh, buh-duh-duh
I hate the mushy shit, and
Buh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh
I tell it how it is, and
Boom, buh-duh-duh, duh-duh
I wish that I was kiddin' but I'm not good at listening
So I don't want someone missin' me
Buh-duh-duh-duh, buh-duh-duh
I hate the mushy shit, and
Buh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh
I tell it how it is, and
Boom, buh-duh-duh, duh-duh
I wish that I was kiddin' but I'm not good at listening
So I don't want someone missin' meEmbed don't miss me don’t miss me Claire Rosinkranz indie
