24 ContributorsEvil Angel Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hold it together
Birds of a feather
Nothing but lies and crooked wings
I have the answer
Spreading the cancer
You are the faith inside me

[Pre-Chorus]
No
Don't
Leave me to die here
Help me survive here
Alone
I don't remember
Remember

[Chorus]
Put me to sleep, evil angel
Open your wings, evil angel

[Verse 2]
I'm a believer
Nothing could be worse
All these imaginary friends
Hiding betrayal
Driving the nail
Hoping to find a savior

No
Don't
Leave me to die here
Help me survive here
Alone
Don't surrender
Surrender

[Chorus]
Put me to sleep, evil angel
Open your wings, evil angel

[Outro]
Fly over me, evil angel
Why can't I breathe?
