26 ContributorsNight Ride Lyrics[Verse 1]
Too soon, wanted more time
Could've held out, but your clock was tickin'
No easing in, straightened out lines
Alone with your thoughts 'cause your friends are still in

[Pre-Chorus]
Night clubs and back rooms, baggies in the bathrooms
Nothing's changed but you
Sayin' nothing's missin,' thoughts are driftin' away from you
The mornin' sun fills the void, now you see there never was a point

[Chorus]
Over and over and over again
'Til you can no longer pretend you are sane
Try but you couldn't get any more sure
And the endin' still will never change
Over and over and over again
'Til you can no longer pretend you are sane
Try but you couldn't get any more sure
And the endin' still will never change

[Bridge]
Tomorrow night'll go on without you, go on without you there
Tomorrow night'll go on without you 'til dawn an' no one will care
You might also like[Verse 2]
You can't know, it's a move in the dark
Hesitation leaves you hung on the lip
Unclench your teeth, peel off the smile
See no one there and you release your grip

[Pre-Chorus]
Night clubs and back rooms, baggies in the bathrooms
Nothing's changed but you
Sayin' nothing's missin', thoughts are driftin' away from you
Led the beast to the clear, one more step and a long way down
The morning sun fills the void, now you see there never was a point

[Chorus]
Over and over and over again
'Til you can no longer pretend you are sane
Try but you couldn't get any more sure
And the endin' still will never change
Over and over and over again
'Til you can no longer pretend you are sane
Try but you couldn't get any more sure
And the endin' still will never change8Embed Night Ride City Club The Growlers garage
