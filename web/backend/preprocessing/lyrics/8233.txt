1 ContributorBurn in Hell Lyrics[Verse 1: Dubbs]
It seems the night has exposed me as something ghostly
She didn't say it but her face was begging saying "Choke me"
Can't help loathing, just dark thoughts mostly
I'm fucking a corpse soon as I separate the roast beef
Yeah, I'm a know freak, can't get the voices out my head
Bring your boys and they'll be dead in the morning
I'll say what I mean, your statements is made up
You praise Satan? Cute, I praise the demon Satan's afraid of
I got this evil inside of me that won't subside and obviously
If you don't want your children missing listen, don't rely on me
The sickest women fine for me, I dangle 'em up high from trees
And leave 'em there to bleed out on the ground upon the lying leaves
Yeah, but I'm not bad, I wouldn't classify me as that
I won't drop that, I would steady keep your eye on the axe
Inside the belly of Hell I was born in the beast
My soul isn't holy, it's only been torn at the seams

[Chorus: Dubbs]
See, this is not a game, this is just a lot of pain
A lot of fucking craziness that's held inside my brain
They call me insane, it really doesn't change shit
Cuz once you in my basement I want you to burn in Hell with me
La lala la la
La lala la la la
I want you to burn in Hell with me
La lala la la
La lala la la la
I want you to burn in Hell

I don't care if they're innocent, rip a body to ligaments
Sinner so I don't give a shit, cook 'em up in my kitchen with
All of the proper instruments, this is 'bout to get intimate
Satisfaction is imminent, savoring the deliciousness
I ate him up, feeling crazy I drank the blood from a ladle
Feeling unstable, I label this tainted love
If you're able to make me hate you you ain't gon' be waking up
Run a cable up through your anal and maybe I'll hang you up
This blade it'll leave you mangled, beware of its fatal touch
If it grazes you at an angle your face will need stapled shut
They praising me like an angel, I say that it ain't enough
I specialize in the painful, I'll make your naval erupt
I love to see liquid dripping out incisions consistently
I'm killing these bitches, sinning, never showing no sympathy
The vision of puddles glistening is really the shit to me
It's Grew and Dubbs and The Beast, we 'bout to go on a killing spree
Come on

[Chorus: Dubbs]
See, this is not a game, this is just a lot of pain
A lot of fucking craziness that's held inside my brain
They call me insane, it really doesn't change shit
Cuz once you in my basement I want you to burn in Hell with me
La lala la la
La lala la la la
I want you to burn in Hell with me
La lala la la
La lala la la la
I want you to burn in Hell
[Verse 3: Playboy The Beast]
Yo, they say I'm sick the way I vividly depict demonic images
Victims airways get constricted and stripped from they skin down to they skeletons
Appendix and appendages dismembered
Die to vengeance if you insult my intelligence
You soft and delicate, never killed nothing devil shit
Defecate on your grave, desecrate you just for the hell of it
Been infatuated with blades, if I swing it at you, won't graze
It's kinda like Super Natural bloodbath I slash and it sprays
No matter how much you pray, you my prey and I can't be saved
My breath it wreaks of decay from the flesh I keep in my cave
Premeditated to penetrate you with six different blades
Six different needles full of viruses, die six different ways
Beast Mode Kill Shit when I say it, it ain't only a phrase
I'm sick and depraved and if you play with me I'll cave in yo face
Murderous thoughts inside my mind sent from an alien race
No saving face, I cut it off and wear it, none of y'all safe

[Chorus: Dubbs]
See, this is not a game, this is just a lot of pain
A lot of fucking craziness that's held inside my brain
They call me insane, it really doesn't change shit
Cuz once you in my basement I want you to burn in Hell with me
La lala la la
La lala la la la
I want you to burn in Hell with me
La lala la la
La lala la la la
