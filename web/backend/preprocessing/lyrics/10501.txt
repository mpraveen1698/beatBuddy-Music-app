Yeah, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
Ooh, la, la, she hella bad
I'ma hit it once, shawty, I won't hit it back
Do the dash, new Balenciaga, got a bag, get it back
Pedal to the gas, shawty, I've been livin' fast
Ooh, la, la, she hella bad
I'ma hit it once, shawty, I won't hit it back
Do the dash, new Balenciaga, got a bag, get it back
Pedal to the gas, shawty (Ay), I've been livin' fast

[Verse 1]
Whatchu' mean? Whatchu' want? What we doin'?
Pull up with a coupe, no roof, just to do it
She only talk cash 'cause she know I speak fluent
The devil in the dress, shawty, I can see through it
She know I'm a rockstar, but I know she a diva
She only send me black hearts
But she always on her knees (Haha)

[Chorus]
Ooh, la, la, she hella bad
I'ma hit it once, shawty, I won't hit it back
Do the dash, new Balenciaga, got a bag, get it back
Pedal to the gas, shawty, I've been livin' fast
Ooh, la, la, she hella bad
I'ma hit it once, shawty, I won't hit it back
Do the dash, new Balenciaga, got a bag, get it back
Pedal to the gas, shawty, I've been livin' fast

She got a cold heart but she know that
Bad lil' bitch takin' pictures off the Kodak

[Chorus]
Ooh, la, la, she hella bad
I'ma hit it once, shawty, I won't hit it back
Do the dash, new Balenciaga, got a bag, get it back
Pedal to the gas, shawty, I've been livin' fast
Ooh, la, la, she hella bad
I'ma hit it once, shawty, I won't hit it back

Pedal to the gas, shawty, I've been livin' fast

[Verse 2]
Ooh, look how she movin', she do it, okay
Baby always got a crib in LA
She only want bills with the blue on the face
She hit my DM and she beg me to stay (Yeah)
New bag, new whip, she earned it
Too bad, too late, she want it
Baby, don't stress, couple mil' in the bank
She look even better when she walk away
[Chorus]
Ooh, la, la, she hella bad

Pedal to the gas, shawty, I've been livin' fast
Ooh, la, la, she hella bad
I'ma hit it once, shawty, I won't hit it back
