Yeah

[Verse 1]
This is the end, this is the end, this is the end of me
Playin' pretend that I'm available emotionally
I'm off a Benz, goin' 'round bends could be the death of me
I'm not ready, I'm not ready

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm the best mistake you ever made
It sounds so fuckin' beautiful when you say my name
I'm praying to a God, a God I don't believe
The more I hide my scars, the easier I bleed

[Chorus]
But maybe I'm the worst, the worst you еver had
Tell you you're bеautiful, then stab you in the back
You're prayin' I'm the one, but maybe I'm a curse
The more you try to fix me, the more you make it worse
Could you love me at my worst?

[Post-Chorus]
Could you love me even though that, that it hurts?
Could you love me, could you love me?
Could you love me at my worst?

Yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't try to call, do not disturb, I do not want to speak
This is the end, demons are friends, angels are enemies
I'm just a fool stuck in the past, your worst memories
I'm not ready for you to forget me

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I'm the best mistake you ever made
It sounds so fuckin' beautiful when you say my name
I'm praying to a God, a God I don't believe
I showed you all my scars that I let nobody see

[Chorus]
But maybe I'm the worst, the worst you ever had
Tell you you're beautiful, then stab you in the back
You're prayin' I'm the one, but maybe I'm a curse
The more you try to fix me, the more you make it worse
Could you love me at my worst?

[Post-Chorus]
Could you love me even though that, that it hurts?
Could you love me, could you love me?
Could you love me at my worst?
[Bridge]
This is the end, this is the end, this is the end of me
This is the end, this is the end, this is the end of me

[Chorus]
But maybe I'm the worst, the worst you ever had
Tell you you're beautiful, then stab you in the back
You're prayin' I'm the one, but maybe I'm a curse
The more you try to fix me, the more you make it worse
Could you love me at my worst?

[Post-Chorus]
Could you love me even though that, that it hurts?
Could you love me, could you love me?
Could you love me at my worst?

[Chorus]
But maybe I'm the worst, the worst you ever had
Tell you you're beautiful then stab you in the back
You're prayin' I'm the one, but maybe I'm a curse
The more you try to fix me, the more you make it worse
Could you love me at my worst?
