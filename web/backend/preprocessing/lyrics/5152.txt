Where will you go when it's over?
Who will you know when it's over?
I know, yeah, I saw you, you know that, right?
Just know that I saw you (I saw you, I saw, I saw)
Where will you go when it's over?
Do you get lost on your own?
I know, yeah, I saw you, you know that, right?
Just know that I saw you (I saw you, I saw, I saw)

[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
Late night, zip ties
Make you wanna miss your flight
Flipping through your feelings like a Gemini
I'm staring at your dark side
So far, so gone
Standing with a white dress on
Only say you need me when your friends gone home
You're tryna get your mind right

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
But if I only get one life, this is what I wanna do
And if I only get one life, I wanna live it with you
And if I only have one night, yeah, I'd spend it with you
So if I only get one life, I wanna live it with you
I’m gonna live it with you

[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart, Emily Warren & Both]
New wave, riptide
Hoping I can change your life
If you need a second chance, you can take mine
See you in a new light (See you in a new—)
Skintight, cocaine
You don't wanna feel this way
You know I'd do anything to make you stay
I'm pulling out my best lines

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
But if I only get one life, this is what I wanna do
And if I only get one life, I wanna live it with you
And if I only have one night, yeah, I'd spend it with you
So if I only get one life, I wanna live it with you

[Outro: Andrew Taggart]
Where will you go when it's over?
Who will you know when it's over?
