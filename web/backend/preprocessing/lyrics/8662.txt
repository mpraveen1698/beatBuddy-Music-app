There's a space on the left side
You were there for the whole ride
And the rock in my glove box
It weighs me down like the taste of

[Pre-Chorus]
All the red wine
And glazed eyes
That set fire to me
Oh, the one dance
In your grasp
Is all I see
(Is all I see)
(Is all I see)
(Is all I see)
(Is all I see)

[Chorus]
91 miles to the grapevine
Still feels longer than a lifetime
We touch, I forget the bad blood
And I let it all fade away
91 miles to the grapevine
Still feels longer than a lifetime
We touch, I forget the bad blood
And I let it all fade away
