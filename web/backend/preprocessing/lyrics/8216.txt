19 ContributorsEverything I Need Lyrics[Verse 1]
Born on the wrong side of the ocean
With all the tides against you
You never thought you'd be much good for anyone
But that's so far from the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I know there's pain in your heart
And you're covered in scars
Wish you could see what I do

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, everything you are
Is everything I need
You're everything to me
Baby, every single part
Is who you're meant to be
'Cause you were meant for me
And you're everything I need

[Verse 2]
You can say I'm wrong
You can turn your back against me
But I am here to stay
(I am here to stay)
Like the sea
She keeps kissing the shoreline
No matter how many times he pushes her away
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause baby, everything you are
Is everything I need
You're everything to me
Baby, every single part
Is who you're meant to be
'Cause you were meant for me

[Bridge]
And everything happens for a reason
It's all a blessing in disguise
I used to question who I was
But now I see
The answer's in your eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, everything you are
Is everything I need
You're everything to me
Baby, every single part
Is who you're meant to be
'Cause you were meant for me
And you're everything I need4Embed Everything I Need Aquaman (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) [Deluxe Edition] Skylar Grey piano
