In the light of the sun, is there anyone?
Oh it has begun
Oh dear you look so lost, eyes are red and tears are shed
This world you must've crossed
You said

[Chorus]
You don't know me, you don't even care, oh yeah
And you said
You don't know me, and you don't wear my chains... oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Essential yet appealed
Carry all your thoughts
Across an open field
When flowers gaze at you
They're not the only ones
Who cry when they see you
Oh, you said

[Chorus]
You don't know me, you don't even care, oh yeah
Well you said
You don't know me, and you don't wear my chains... oh yeah

She said I think I'll go to Boston
I think I'll start a new life
I think I'll start it over, where no one knows my name
I'll get out of California, I'm tired of the weather
I think I'll get a lover and fly him out to Spain
Oh yeah and I think I'll go to Boston
I think that I'm just tired
I think I need a new town, to leave this all behind
I think I need a sunrise, I'm tired of the sunset
I hear it's nice in the summer, some snow would be nice
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
You don't know me, and you don't even care, oh yeah

[Outro]
Boston
Where no one knows my name
Where no one knows my name
Where no one knows my name, yeah
Boston
Where no one knows my name13Embed Boston All The Stars and Boulevards Augustana acoustic
