Bye, bye, love
Bye, bye, happiness
Hello, loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye, bye, love
Bye, bye, sweet caress
Hello, emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye, bye, my love, goodbye

[Verse 1]
There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby 'till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might've been

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, love
Bye, bye, happiness
Hello, loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye, bye, love
Bye, bye, sweet caress
Hello, emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye, bye, my love, goodbye

I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
I'm through with counting the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My lovin' baby is through with me

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, love
Bye, bye, happiness
Hello, loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye, bye, love
Bye, bye, sweet caress
Hello, emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye, bye, my love, goodbye
Bye, bye, my love, goodbye
Bye, bye, my love, goodbye
Bye, bye, my love, goodbye6Embed Bye Bye Love The Very Best of The Everly Brothers The Everly Brothers rockabilly
