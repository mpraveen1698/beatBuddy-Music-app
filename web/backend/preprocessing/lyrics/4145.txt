9 ContributorsWild Lyrics[Verse 1: John Legend]
I just bought a new car
One where the top goes down
So we can see the stars
I wanna take you so far
Out past the Saturn rings
And into my heart

[Chorus: John Legend]
I wanna drive you
Wild, wild, wild
I wanna love you
For miles and miles
We can go slow
We don't need to rush
I'll take the wheel, make you feel every touch
I wanna drive you
Wild, wild, wild

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Lay on the passenger's side
Tell me how fast you want
We'll get there tonight
Oh, oh, oh, fire
You set me on fire
I swear you're the only one
I'd take on this ride
You might also like[Chorus: John Legend]
I wanna drive you
Wild, wild, wild
I wanna love you
For miles and miles
We can go slow
We don't need to rush
I'll take the wheel, make you feel every touch
I wanna drive you
Wild, wild, wild

[Instrumental Interlude: Gary Clark Jr.]

[Bridge: John Legend]
Yeah
Wanna love you, wanna touch you, wanna drive you (Wild, wild, wild)
Oh, wanna love you, wanna touch you

[Chorus: John Legend]
I wanna drive you
Wild, wild, wild
And I wanna love you
For miles and miles
We can go slow
We don't need to rush
I'll take the wheel, make you feel every touch
I wanna drive you
Wild, wild, wild
[Outro: John Legend]
Yeah, I wanna drive you
