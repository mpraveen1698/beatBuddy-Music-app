1 ContributorSunny Day LyricsIt's a sunny day
It's so bright, so bright, so bright
It's a sunny day
It's so bright, so bright, so bright

Let's take a walk
In the woods
Take your mind off
Yeah you should
Let's take a walk
Up to the moon
Take your mind off
Yeah you should
Come on
Darlin'
Follow me
You will see
Come on
Baby
Today is a good day
