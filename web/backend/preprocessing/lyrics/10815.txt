You can't just give it away
Like it means nothing
Love isn't this game where
You win something

[Pre-Chorus: Alpines]
I'm tired of being on the outside
I wanna know what it's like
I'm tired of seeing all the sights
I wanna feel us collide

[Chorus: Alpines]
Your love washes over like a tidal wave
I feel the impact as we collide
Your love washes over like a tidal wave
I feel the impact as we collide

[Verse 2: Alpines]
All the games that we play
You're fooling nobody
If it makes you feel good
When you're hurting somebody

[Pre-Chorus: Alpines]
I'm tired of being on the outside
I wanna know what it's like
I'm tired of seeing all the sights
I wanna feel us collide
You might also like[Chorus: Alpines]
Your love washes over like a tidal wave
I feel the impact as we collide
Your love washes over like a tidal wave
I feel the impact as we collide

[Outro: Alpines]
I feel the impact as we collide1Embed Tidal Wave Torus Sub Focus;Alpines drum-and-bass
