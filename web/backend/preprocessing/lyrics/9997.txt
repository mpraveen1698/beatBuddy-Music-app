Are you, are you coming here with me
To run by my side so we can free?
Strange things do happen here
It's the time to leave
If we met at midnight at the willow tree
Are you, are you coming here with me
To run by my side so we can free?
Strange things do happen here
It's the time to leave
If we met at midnight at the willow tree
Are you, are you coming here with me
To run by my side so we can free?
Strange things d0 happen here
It's the time to leave
If we met at midnight at the willow tree
Are you (Are you), are you (Are you) coming here with me
To run by my side so we can free?
Strange things do happen here
It's the time to leave
If we met at midnight at the willow tree
Are you (Are you), are you (Are you) coming here with me
To run by my side so we can free?
Strange things do happen here
It's the time to leave
If we met at midnight at the willow tree
