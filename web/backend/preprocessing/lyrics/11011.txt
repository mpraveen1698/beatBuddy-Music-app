Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, oh, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

All my memories gather 'round her
Miner’s lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, oh, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, oh, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Oh, take me home

I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin’
I should've been home yesterday, yesterday

Take me home
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, oh, mountain mama
Take me home
Take me home, country roads
Oh, country roads, take me home
Oh, country roads, take me homeEmbed Take Me Home, Country Roads (Acoustic) Take Me Home, Country Roads (Acoustic) Music Travel Love country
