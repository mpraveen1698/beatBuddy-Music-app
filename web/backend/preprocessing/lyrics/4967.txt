[Verse]
Would you believe me when I tell you
You're the queen of my heart?
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems

[Chorus]
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse]
Would you believe me when I tell you
You're the queen of my heart?
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems

[Chorus]
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?!
