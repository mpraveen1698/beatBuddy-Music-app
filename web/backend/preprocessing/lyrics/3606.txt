I watched you walk away
Hopeless, with nothing to say
I strain my eyes
Hoping to see you again

[Chorus]
This is my curse (The longing)
This is my curse (Time)
This is my curse (The yearning)
This is my curse
There is love burning to find you
Will you wait for me?
Will you be there?

Roh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Your silence haunts me
But still I hunger for you

[Chorus]
This is my curse (The wanting)
This is my curse (Time)
This is my curse (The healing)
This is my curse
There is love burning to find you
Will you wait for me?

And still I want
And still I ache
But still I wait

[Verse 2]
To see you again
Dying, inside, these walls
Dying, inside, these walls
And I see your face in these tears
In these tears
And I see your face

[Outro]
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
