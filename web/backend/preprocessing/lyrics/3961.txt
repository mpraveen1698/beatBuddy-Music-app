Yeah, I get it you're an outcast
Always under attack
Always comin' in last
Bringin' up the past
No one owes you anything
I think you need a shotgun blast
A kick in the ass
So paranoid, watch your back
Oh my, here we go

[Verse 1]
Another loose cannon gone bipolar
Slipped down, couldn't get much lower
Quicksand's got no sense of humor
I'm still laughin' like hell

[Pre-Chorus]
You think that by cryin' to me
Lookin' so sorry that I'm gonna believe
You've been infected by a social disease
Well, then take your medicine

[Chorus]
I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here
To explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself

I'm so sick of this tombstone mentality
If there's an afterlife, then it'll set you free
But I'm not, gonna part the seas
You're a self-fulfilling prophecy

[Pre-Chorus]
You think, that by cryin' to me
Lookin' so sorry that I'm gonna believe
You've been infected, by a social disease
Well, then take your medicine

[Chorus]
I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here
To explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself

[Bridge]
Well I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here
To explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up... when you gonna wake up
And fight
[Chorus]
I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here
To explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself

[Outro]
But when you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself
But when you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself
When you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself14Embed Sound of Madness The Sound of Madness Shinedown grunge
