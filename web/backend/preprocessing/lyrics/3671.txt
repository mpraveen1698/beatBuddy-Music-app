6 ContributorsMidas Lyrics[Intro]
(If you're making love
You'll get real love, ooh babe)

[Verse 1]
It was right there in front of me
Screaming loud, I didn't want to see
His skewed desires, crushed down on me
Trying to use me up, but I never had a Midas touch

[Chorus]
(If you're making love)
You wanna chew me up
But I'm never gonna lose the love
(You'll get real love, ooh babe)
What's a goodbye?

[Verse 2]
So I cut loose violently
But when you name your price
It only heightens
I never believed what you sought in me
It's wrong, I know, it's wrong, I know, it's wrong

[Chorus]
(Oh, here I go, making love)
But if I defy you, you're only frightened
(You get real love)
What's a goodbye?
(You can't get real love, real love)
You wanna chew me up
But I'm never gonna lose the love
(You get real love, ooh babe)
So it's a goodbye?

It might be you'd have the right
To define me
It might be you'd have the dime
To entice me

What do we do?
With where we are going
Our different routes?
Maybe you should waste your life
Instead of mine, instead of mine, instead of mine

[Chorus]
(Oh here I go, making love)
You wanna chew me up
But I'm never gonna lose the love
(You get real love, ooh babe)
What's a goodbye?
(You can't get real love, real love)
But if I defy you, you're only frightened
(You can't get [?])
