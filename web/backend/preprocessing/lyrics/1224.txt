89 ContributorsFreak on a Leash Lyrics[Verse 1]
Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me, from me

[Verse 2]
Life's gotta always be messin' with me (You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain? (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

[Chorus]
Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

[Verse 3]
Feelin' like a freak on a leash (You wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release (So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free, is free

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

[Chorus]
Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

So fight, something on the ming-a-ooh
Fight, some things they fight
So, something on the ming-a-ooh
Fight, some things they fight
Fight, something off the hee-a-hoo
No, some things they fight
Fight, something on the ming-a-hoo
Fight, some things they fight
