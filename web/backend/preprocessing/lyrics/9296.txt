16 ContributorsBend & Break Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you, when you forget your name
When old faces all look the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Meet me in the morning when you wake up
Meet me in the morning, then you'll wake up

[Chorus]
If only I don't bend and break
I'll meet you on the other side, I'll meet you in the light
If only I don't suffocate
I'll meet you in the morning when you wake

[Verse 2]
Bitter and hardened heart
Oh, aching, waiting for life to start

[Pre-Chorus]
Meet me in the morning when you wake up
Meet me in the morning, then you'll wake up

[Chorus]
If only I don't bend and break
I'll meet you on the other side, I'll meet you in the light
If only I don't suffocate
I'll meet you in the morning when you wake

If only I don't bend and break
I'll meet you on the other side, I'll meet you in the light
If only I don't suffocate
I'll meet you in the morning when you wake
I'll meet you on the other side, I'll meet you in the light
If only I don't suffocate
I'll meet you in the morning when you wake1Embed Bend & Break Hopes And Fears Keane piano
