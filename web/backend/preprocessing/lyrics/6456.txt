34 ContributorsCrosstown Traffic Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
You jump in front of my car
When you, you know all the time
That ninety miles an hour, girl
Is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright
You don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to
Take you for a drive
You're just like

[Chorus]
(Crosstown traffic) So hard to get through to you
(Crosstown traffic) I don't need to run over you
(Crosstown traffic) All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town

[Verse 2]
I'm not the only soul
Who's accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can, I can see you had your fun
But uh, darling can't you see
My signals turn from green to red?
And with you, I can see a traffic jam
Straight up ahead
You're just like
You might also like[Chorus]
(Crosstown traffic) So hard to get through to you
(Crosstown traffic) I don't need to run over you
(Crosstown traffic) All you do is slow me down
And I've got better things on the other side of town

[Instrumental Bridge]
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
(Crosstown traffic)
(Yeah, look out) Look out!
Look out, baby, comin' through
(Crosstown traffic)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, look out)
(Crosstown traffic)
Yeah (Yeah, look out)
Look out, look out, baby
(Crosstown traffic)
(Yeah, look out)
What's that on the street?
Move over (Crosstown traffic)
(Yeah, look out) Yeah!
(Crosstown traffic)
(Yeah, look out)9Embed Crosstown Traffic Electric Ladyland Jimi Hendrix blues
