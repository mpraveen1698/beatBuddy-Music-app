You know I don't believe in ghosts or
Letting people close
I'm good at letting go
You kiss my lips until they're colder
Think you're in control, but
I should let you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the good guys don't always get the glory
Can't you see the warning signs?

[Chorus]
I can make your life a livin' hell
If I wanted to, wanted to
Wish this was a love you never felt
And you know it's true, know it's true
Love me, love me, trust me with that heart of yours
Feels so heavy lyin' on the bedroom floor
I can make your life a livin' hell
If I wanted to, wanted to

[Verse 2]
Chew you up and spit you out
And still you come around
So I can watch you drown
Hate when you tell me that you'll wait
Like you think that I could change
When I've always been this way
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the good guys don't always get the glory
Can't you see the warning signs?

[Chorus]
I can make your life a livin' hell
If I wanted to, wanted to
Wish this was a love you never felt
And you know it's true, know it's true
Love me, love me, trust me with that heart of yours
Feels so heavy lyin' on the bedroom floor
I can make your life a livin' hell
If I wanted to, wanted to

[Bridge]
I'm haunted by the words you say
When I can't say that I feel the same
And that you'll always be alone
And, baby, you should know
I'm only gonna ghost

[Chorus]
I can make your life a livin' hell
If I wanted to, wanted to (If I wanted to)
Wish this was a love you never felt
And you know it's true, know it's true (And you know it's true)
Love me, love me, trust me with that heart of yours (Love me)
Feels so heavy lyin' on the bedroom floor
I can make your life a livin' hell
If I wanted to, wanted to (If I wanted to)2Embed Living Hell Dolls EP Bella Poarch alternative
