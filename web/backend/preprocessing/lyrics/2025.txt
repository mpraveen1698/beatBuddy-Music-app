Whispered something in your ear
It was a perverted thing to say
But I said it anyway
Made you smile and look away

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side

[Verse 2]
When we dance in my living room
To that silly 90's R&B
When we have a drink or three
Always ends in a hazy shower scene

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side

[Bridge]
When we laugh into the microphone and sing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs
When we're laughing in the microphone and singing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs
