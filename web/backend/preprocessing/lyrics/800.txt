I'm only human
I'm only, I'm only
I'm only human
Human (Human)

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm foolis
Maybe I'm blind
Thinking I can see through this
And see what's behind
Got no way to prove it
So maybe I'm lying

[Refrain]
But I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put your blame on me (Oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Take a look in the mirror
And what do you see?
Do you see it clearer
Or are you deceived
In what you believe? (Oh-oh-oh)
