Stormin' through the party like my name was El Niño
When I'm hangin' out drinkin' in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never goin', never showin' up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearin' "act your age"

[Chorus]
I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

[Verse 2]
Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we like havin' fun at other people's expense, and
Cuttin' people down is just a minor offense, then
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn

I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

[Bridge]
Don't count on me
To let you know when
Don't count on me
I'll do it again
Don't count on me
It's the point you're missin'
Don't count on me
'Cause I'm not listenin'

[Breakdown]
Well, I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothin'
You be standin' on the corner talking all that kufuffin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffin'
'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringin' off the hook
You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion
[Chorus]
I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

[Outro]
(Waste my time with them)
Casualty of society
(Waste my time with them)
Victim of your conformity and back down29Embed Fat Lip All Killer, No Filler Sum 41 punk
