14 ContributorsUs Against the World Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh whoa
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh whoa

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm lost and numb
Cold to the touch
I pretend like I don't remember your name
Every masterpiece
Pales to blasphemy
When I close my eyes, yeah, I still see your face

[Chorus]
We were the thunder and the lightning
Burnt forests started from a spark
I would spin you just to watch you twirl
It was us against the world

You were the rain falling on my skin
Yeah, I was dying when you pulled me in
I was your rebel and you were my girl
Yeah, it was us against the world

[Buildup]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh whoa
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh whoa
I was your rebel and you were my girl
It was us against the world

(Woo!)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm pale and grey
All dust and frayed
When I call for you, all I hear back is pain
Every song must end
Even diamonds fade
When the darkness comes, I count up my mistakes

[Chorus]
We were the thunder and the lightning
Burnt forests started from a spark
I would spin you just to watch you twirl
It was us against the world
You were the rain falling on my skin
Yeah, I was dying when you pulled me in
I was your rebel and you were my girl
Yeah, it was us against the world

[Buildup]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh whoa
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh whoa
(We were, we were, we were the thunder and the lightning)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh whoa
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh whoa
I was your rebel and you were my girl
It was us against the world
[Drop]
(Hey!)
