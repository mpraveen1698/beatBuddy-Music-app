2 ContributorsThe One LyricsI've run
The fields a thousand times
This dreamâ€™s so hard to find
Still need you in my life
By My Side

Always..

She will be the one
She will be the one

Always..

She will be the one
I am coming home to

I've run
For so long in my mind
These days it's hard to find
Without you by my side
In my life

Always..

She will be the one
She will be the one
