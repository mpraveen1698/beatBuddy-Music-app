Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
(Yoshi)
(Good job, Sho!)
Met a few girls that I liked
Gorgeous hips, gorgeous eyes (Ah-ha)
They broke my heart on a sly
They didn't ride, it's fine 'cah I ain't got time for a wife (No way)
Too many girls that I've liked
Can't be wife, ain't got time
She wanna be my queen for the night
But I gotta chase dough, not chase her thighs

[Chorus: A1orFundz & J1mulla]
She wanna dance the night away
We still young, and you're just not the one
I don't wanna dance, she broke my heart
Do I still givе you a chance to─
Dance the night away
Livе your life 'cause my love ain't enough
She wanna dance, 'cah we chart
Sorry babes, I'm with the dargs
Dance the night away
We still young, and you're just not the one
I-I don't wanna dance, she broke my heart
Do I still give you a chance to─
Dance the night away
Live your life 'cause my love ain't enough
She wanna dance, cah we chart
Sorry babes, I'm with the dargs

Since she got a new boyfriend, I ain't seen her (Ah-ha)
Snapchat Sophie B, and Athena
Just playing games I don't really want either
Heart so cold from I'm keepin' it real
'Cause she need me, I don't need her (I don't)

[Pre-Chorus: A1orFundz]
Who's who?
I'ma do me, I beg you do you, you
To tango, it takes two, two
Focus on my own moves, yeah

There was Sabrina and Lucy (Grrt)
Before the rap ting, I was bookie (Mm-mm)
You would think I was Harry Styles, the way I always had Louis (Boom)
I got a brownin' looking all Asian (Ay)
Say she wanna link Wizzy and J1
Even though I got BRIT nomination, the wap come bigger than A1 (Brrah)
We can't go there, it's all long (Long)
If you don't wanna hear, you'll feel it
I got a young boy move, Jackson (Baow, baow)
Because he just wan' beat it (Ayy)
And she my babe, she's no one else then
Back your mash and just corrode them (Mm-mm)
True say I've come a long way from Feltham (Baow, baow)
She love bad man, Jesy Nelson

[Verse 4: A1orFundz]
Still young and lit
And she don't know that I just turned sixteen
'Cause I'm in charts, she thinks I'm rich
More pending checks than Burberry
Yo, she asked me to follow her socials
That's the reason I antisocial
Still dropping viral vocals
Worldwide, but I'm still so local

[Pre-Chorus: A1orFundz]
Who's who?
I'ma do me, I beg you do you, you
To tango, it takes two, two
Focus on my own moves

She wanna dance, 'cah we chart
Sorry babes, I'm with the dargs
Dance the night away
We still young, and you're just not the one
I-I don't wanna dance, she broke my heart
Do I still give you a chance to─
Dance the night away
Live your life 'cause my love ain't enough (She wanna)
She wanna dance, 'cah we chart
Sorry babes, I'm with the dargs (Dargs)
