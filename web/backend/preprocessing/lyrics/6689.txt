10 ContributorsL O V E Lyrics[Verse]
L is for the way you look at me
O is for the only one I see
V is very, very extraordinary
E is even more than anyone that you adore

[Chorus]
And love is all that I can give to you
Love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it
Take my heart but please don't break it
Love was made for me and you

[Verse]
L is for the way you look at me
O is for the only one I see

E is even more than anyone that you adore

[Chorus]
And love is all that I can give to you
Love, love, love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it
Take my heart but please don't break it
'Cause love was made for me and you
I said love was made for me and you
You know that love was made for me and youYou might also like6Embed L O V E Call Me Irresponsible (Deluxe) Michael Bubl√© jazz
