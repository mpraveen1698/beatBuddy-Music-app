You can try to act tough but I see right through you (Right through you, baby)
I know you've been through a lot, they can't walk in your shoes (Oh no)
Baby, let your guard down
World's loud, we could shut it out
You can put ya trust in me if you choose (If you choose)
Hard on your self
I know you can't help it
I'm finding myself in you

[Chorus: thuy]
How do I
Make you realize
I'ma stick around
If it's with you, you, you
Oh, I
Came to realize
That I'm finding myself in you (Baby)

[Verse 2: RINI]
Said I'm taking my time with you (Taking my time)
Never wanna put pressure on you (I don't)
But I'm just tryna make you understand (No, no)
That no man is an island
I'm ready to give you everything (No, no)
But I don't know if you're ready to do the same (Ooh)
Don't matter to me how long you take (No, it don't matter)
No one knows you like I do (I do)
