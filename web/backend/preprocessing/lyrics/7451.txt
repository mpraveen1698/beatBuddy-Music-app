14 Contributors99 Problems Lyrics[Intro]

If you're having girl problems
I feel bad for your son
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one...

[Verse One]

Tip my hat to the sun in the west
Feel the beat right in my chest
At the crossroads a second time
Make the devil change his mind
It's a pound of flesh
But it's really a ton
99 problems and a bitch ain't one

[Chorus]

If you're having girl troubles
I feel bad for your son
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
99 problems... But a bitch ain't one

[Verse Two]

Like broken glass under my feet
I can lose my mind in the sea
Looking for the prize but I don't want blood
I order one drink then I drink the flood
You can come inside, but your friends can't come
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
You might also like[Chorus]

If you're having girl problems
I feel bad for your son
99 problems and a bitch ain't one
I've got 99...
99...
99...
99...

99 ... problems
But a bitch ain't one
99...

[Outro]
