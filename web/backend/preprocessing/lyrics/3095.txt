20 ContributorsLAst dAy oN EaRTh Lyrics[Chorus]
If it was my last day on Earth, if it was my last day
If it was my last day on Earth, if it was my last day
If I close my eyes and the sun don't rise, will I be okay?
If it was my last day on Earth, if it was my last day

[Verse 1]
If it was my last day on Earth, I wouldn't be in church
I'm sorry, God, but it's my last day in this universe
I need to see birds and buzzin' bees, green grass, evergreen trees
Not seein' people who have been mean to me
And why would I waste my time?
All my favorite people need teary-eyed goodbyes
Talk, laugh, hug and give a bunch of hard high-fives
I did my best, man, I gave this thing a good try

[Chorus]
If it was my last day on Earth, if it was my last day
If it was my last day on Earth, if it was my last day
If I close my eyes and the sun don't rise, will I be okay?
If it was my last day on Earth, if it was my last day (Wait, wait, wait)

[Verse 2]
You tellin' me I got twenty-four of these sixty-minute things left?
Damn, I ain't gеt to be a billionaire yet
Fly around first-class, privatе jet, flex
Use a black Amex, get up out the duplexes
Buy a Lexus, take a road trip to a spaceship, uh
And I'ma get on
Blast up in the sky and I'ma get gone
Gave up too much just to see one more dawn
You might also like[Chorus]
If it was my last day on Earth, if it was my last day
If it was my last day on Earth, if it was my last day
If I close my eyes and the sun don't rise, will I be okay?
If it was my last day on Earth, if it was my last day

[Outro]
(Yeah-yeah)
