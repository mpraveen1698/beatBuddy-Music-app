I can hear it callin'
Loving the way you wanna talk
Touch me, tease me, feel me up
Callin', something in the way you wanna talk

[Verse 1: Lucas, Winwin]
You got me sayin', you got me sayin'
"How you doing?" (Ay) "Tell me what's your name" (What's your name?)
"What's your sign? Feeling like you're into me"
Yeah, I'm waiting (Ooh)
I just want you to come on over where I'm staying (Ay, ay, ay, ay)

[Verse 2: Hendery, Lucas, Yangyang]
Falling for a stranger (Yeah), good gracious (Yeah)
I might even fly out to Vegas (Catch a flight)
I'm thinking maybe you'd be down to do it (Yeah)
But you don't know what I'm saying (Saying)

[Verse 3: Yangyang]
Got me going through the roof, roof
Really don't care what we do, do, ay
We could fly to the Moon
I see your lips moving but we ain't got a clue

[Pre-Chorus: Xiaojun]
Baby, we two distant strangers
I know you don't speak my language
But I love the way she's talking to me (Talking to me)
You might also like[Chorus: Kun, All]
I can hear it callin' from where you are
Loving the way you wanna talk
Touch me, tease me, feel me up
Touch me, tease me, feel me up
Call me when it's after dark
Something in the way you wanna talk
Touch me, tease me, feel me up
Touch me, tease me, feel me up

[Verse 4: Hendery, Yangyang]
Max, max, max, we can have it all (To the max)
If you back, back, back, back, back it up (Back it, back it)
I'll take you where you wanna, got the gas in the tank (Wow)
If you really wanna make it last (Git, git, git)

[Verse 5: Winwin, Lucas]
Talk's cheap, I'm 'bout that action (Whoa, 'bout that action)
Girl, can you feel the attraction?
Baby, come closer, I got what you want
I can tell you that you want it, there's no need to front

[Pre-Chorus: Ten]
Baby, we two distant strangers
I know you don't speak my language
But I love the way she's talking to me (Talking to me)
[Chorus: Xiaojun, All]
I can hear it callin' from where you are
Loving the way you wanna talk
Touch me, tease me, feel me up
Touch me, tease me, feel me up
Call me when it's after dark
Something in the way you wanna talk
Touch me, tease me, feel me up
Touch me, tease me, feel me up

[Post-Chorus: Kun, Ten, Xiaojun]
Ooh, tell me, babe
Tell me how you like it, babe
I don't even know your name

Ooh, tell me babe
Tell me how you like it babe
I don't even know your name
I love the way you're talking to me

[Bridge: Ten, Kun, Xiaojun]
Girl, the way you move
You can feel my eyes on you, ooh-ooh
Do it like nobody do, ooh (Ay)
Tell me what you wanna hear
Let me whisper in your ear
I just wanna have you here, yeah
[Verse 6: Yangyang, Lucas, Hendery]
Okay, baby make it fast (Make it fast, right, ay)
We could put the country on the map (Put it on the map, ay)
Run it back, you gon' have me runnin' laps (Runnin' laps, ay)
I just, I just want you to make it clap (Ay, ay)
One at a time, baby you're mine (Whoa, yeah)
Promise that you'll never give it away (Yeah, uh)
I need a sign
Calling me up, calling me yours, calling my line
Doing what you're doing to me, baby, it's a crime

[Chorus: Ten, All]
I can hear it callin' from where you are (Callin', woo)
Loving the way you wanna talk (Love the way you talk)
Touch me, tease me, feel me up (Yeah, yeah)
Touch me, tease me, feel me up
Call me when it's after dark (Call me now)
Something in the way you wanna talk (Woo)
Touch me, tease me, feel me up
Touch me, tease me, feel me up

[Post-Chorus: Xiaojun, Kun, Winwin, Ten]
Ooh, tell me, babe
Tell me how you like it babe
