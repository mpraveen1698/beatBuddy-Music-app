What is love?
Did I miss it?
Am I home
Or still adrift?

[Chorus]
Love brought weight to this heart of mine
Gone to waste in due time

[Verse 2]
Keep on movin'
If you still can
A simple home
A love in hand

[Chorus]
Love brought weight to this heart of mine
Gone to waste in due time
Love brought weight to this heart of mine
You're away, but I'll be fine

[Bridge]
And I'll be fine
Outgrow our time
Down the line
You'll see
You might also like[Chrous]
Love brought weight to this heart of mine
Gone to waste in due time
Love brought weight to this heart of mine
You're away, but I'll be fine
And I'll be fineEmbed Love Brought Weight Old Sea Brigade Old Sea Brigade folk
