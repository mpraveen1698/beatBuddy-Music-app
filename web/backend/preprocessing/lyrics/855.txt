14 ContributorsTennessee Orange Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mama, I'm callin', I've got some news
Don't you tell Daddy, he'll blow a fuse
Don't worry, I'm doin' okay
I know you raised me to know right from wrong
It ain't what you think and I'm still writin' songs
Just never thought I'd see the day
I've never felt this way

[Chorus]
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

[Verse 2]
Took me to Knoxville last Saturday
And I wore the hat on his dash to the game
It sure wasn't Athens, but I
Fell for him under those Neyland lights

[Chorus]
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

Mama, forgive me, I like him a lot
Hell, I'm learnin' the words to "Old Rocky Top"
He's got a smile that makes me forget
I've always looked better in red

[Chorus]
But I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
And I still want the Dawgs to win
But I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

[Outro]
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for himEmbed Tennessee Orange Tennessee Orange Megan Moroney country
