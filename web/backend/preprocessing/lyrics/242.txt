Alright, Mello made it right
Bye-bye, bye-bye
Oh my, get out my life
She said, "Why?"
(Mello made it right)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I hit her with a bye-bye, bye-bye
You're out your mind
I'm out of pills
And you're out of lies
It stays dark outside
Even when it's daytime
Like, bye-bye, bye-bye
Uh, bye-bye, bye-bye

[Verse: Juice WRLD]
Um, see you later, uh
Girl, I got a question for you, yeah, I need a favor (Uh)
Turn yourself back to a demon, I'm a demon slayer (Uh)
Hell-proof to the core, take me to your lair (Uh)
Uh, hella persuasive
Hella curved animation, like The Matrix
Percocet, body achin', stomach achin'
Feel like it's a fuckin' earthquake where my brain is, huh, oh
Hell's Kitchen blazing
Cookin' coke off a slave master's bloody apron
I remember havin' a dream catcher when I was like ten
Set that bitch on fire, all my dreams been comin' true since (Been comin' true since)

And you're out of lies
It stays dark outside
Even when it's daytime
Like, bye-bye, bye-bye
Uh, bye-bye, bye-bye (Bye)30Embed Bye Bye Bye Bye Marshmello;Juice WRLD edm
