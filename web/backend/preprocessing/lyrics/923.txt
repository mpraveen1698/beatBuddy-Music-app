"There must be some kind of way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word," hey

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke, but, uh
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talking falsely now
The hour's getting late, hey

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too, well, uh
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl, hey

[Outro]
All along the watchtower
Beware!
