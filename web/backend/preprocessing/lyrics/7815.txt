5 ContributorsOkinawa Lyrics[Verse 1]
I want to stay by the sea
Watching turn into red
Sat down with the people
Listen through this song
Moon is slowly risin'
I see the trees are movin'
Sky is brighten, through the moon

[Bridge]
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-m-hmm-m-hm
Hmm-hm
Hmm-m-hm-m-hm

[Verse 2]
Look at those trees
Look how they move by the breeze
Look at those stars
Look how they shine through the night

[Bridge]
Hm-hm
Hmm-m-hmm
Hmm-m-hmm-m-hm
Hmm-hm
Hmm-m-hmm-m-hm
Hmm-hm
Hmm-m-hmm-m-hm
