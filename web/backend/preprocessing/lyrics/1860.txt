My feet are aching
And your back is pretty tired
And we've drunk a couple bottles, babe
And set our grief aside
The papers say it's doomsday
The button has been pressed
We're gonna nuke each other up, boys
'Til old Satan stands impressed

[Pre-Chorus]
And here it is, our final night alive
And as the earth burns to the ground
[Chorus]
Oh, girl, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Oh, it's you I watch TV with
As the world, as the world caves in

[Verse 2]
You put your finest suit on
I paint my fingernails
Oh, we're going out in style, babe
And everything's on sale
We creep up on extinction
I pull your arms right in
I weep and say "Goodnight, love"
While my organs pack it in
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And here it is, our final night alive
And as the earth burns to the ground

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Oh, it's you I watch TV with
As the world, as the world cavesâ€”
Oh, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Yes, it's you I welcome death with
As the world, as the world caves in

[Outro]
