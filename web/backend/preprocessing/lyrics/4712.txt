I put a spell on you, 'cause you're mine
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo ah
You better stop the things you do
I ain't lyin'
No, I ain't lyin'
You know I can't stand it
You're runnin' around
You know better, daddy
I can't stand it 'cause you put me down, yeah-yeah
I put a spell on you, because you're mine
You're mine

And I don't care
If you don't want me
