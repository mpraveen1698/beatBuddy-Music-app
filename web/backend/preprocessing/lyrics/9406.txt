2 ContributorsAll About It Lyrics[Verse 1]
I’ve been turning on the lights even
When it’s late at night
Cause it’s dark, the way you left without me
I put on my favorite show
Just to hear them talking low
Cause I’m trying to forget the lonely

[Chorus]
And I know you won’t come back
Can’t say I haven’t counted
It’s slow, tryna move past
One day, now it’s a thousand
One foot and then the other
Feels like it never ends
Heartbroken from a lover
I know all about it

[Verse 2]
Try to leave the house
And my friends they drag me out
Dressing myself up only to miss you
And it wouldn’t even help
Yeah if I kiss someone else it’s
Still too soon for me to want to
You might also like[Chorus]
And I know you won’t come back
Can’t say I haven’t counted
It’s slow, tryna move past
One day, now it’s a thousand
One foot and then the other
Feels like it never ends
Heartbroken from a lover
I know all about it

[Outro]
How long will it take
To go away?
To get you out my brain?
How long will it take
To go away?
The pain it always stays
I know all about itEmbed All About It All About It Deep Chills french
