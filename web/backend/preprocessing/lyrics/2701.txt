(Dancing with you; Ozuna; let's go!)

[Chorus: Anuel AA, Daddy Yankee & Ozuna]
My wife was calling me
But I didn't answer (Uah, baby; turn it up)
Because I was dancing with you
And I forgot about her (Mami)
God forgive me
I don't know why I failed her (I failed; uah)
I was dancing in the club
And I got distracted with her (Woah, oh, oh; let's go!; uah)

[Verse 1: Ozuna]
From the way she looked at me (Woah, oh, oh)
I could tell that she had I was looking for at the club (Looking for)
I wanted to dance with her (Woah, oh)
And for the DJ to never turn down the music
And she's having a good time (Good time)
She doesn't fall in love, she just wants to have fun (To have fun)
She is always alone, she is still self-centered (Still self-centered)
She provokes me and I fall into her game (I fall)
And she's having a good time (Good time)
She doesn't fall in love, she just wants to have fun (To have fun)
She is always alone, she is still self-centered (Still self-centered)
She provokes me and I fall into her game and it's that (Haha)

Baby, put your hands on the floor (Floor)
And play with your hair (Your hair)
Your body is pure venom (Venom)

(¡Da-ddy Yan-kee!)
You beat me
You got me into your game and you hurt me
I might spend my money with you
I think I am a millionaire throwing money in the air
Because you are beautiful, I flirt
So let's discuss and I never come back, that's why (Rrr!)
I want to go home with you, but you don't let me (Oh, oh, oh)
That ass is a threat, I already think you're my partner (Let's go!)
One shot (Ayy), two shots (Ayy), the problem started
Because alcohol got into my system (Prr)
Whoever tells what happened here will have problems with us
Don't blame me, blame her (Come on!)

I got distracted with you (I got distracted)
And with a couple of drinks, baby, I loosened up (I loosened up)

I don't know why I failed (Yeah, yeah)
But I know what a good time I had (Ah)
Midnight arrived (Night)
We were just beginning to touch each other (Touch)
It's just that my boyfriend was waiting for me
Before twelve o'clock (Twelve)
What a good time we had last night (night)
I know I failed and he must forgive me (Eh, eh)
And if I see him again tomorrow (Ah)
I will say that he don't know me

Baby, you made me fall
That booty that even a blind man can see
And even the holiest wants to be unfaithful (Leggo; yeah, yeah)

From D.R. to Cartagena
I only feel good with you
If having you is bad, I pay my sentence, baby
