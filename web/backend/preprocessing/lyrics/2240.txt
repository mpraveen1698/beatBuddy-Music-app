1 ContributorStill (I Got Summer on My Mind) [Fortella Remix] Lyrics[?]

I got summer on my mind
Nowhere else though
Lord take me downtown or to you
People show me love but I can't take it
What I said was true
Real pain, can't fake it

Still they wanna be with me
Still they wanna live with me
Still they wanna feel like me
Still I can't believe it's me

Still they wanna be with me
Still they wanna live with me
Still they wanna feel like me

I got summer on my mind
Nowhere else though
Lord takе me downtown or to you
Summer on my mind
Nowherе else though
Lord take me downtown or to you
