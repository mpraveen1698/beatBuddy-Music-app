2 ContributorsDarkside Lyrics[Intro]
Bounty on my heart wanted dead or alive, yeah
I been driving far to escape from this life, yeah
Said I'd be a star way before I knew the price
Ever since I started paying I've been praying for a light

[Chorus]
Cause shits been getting dark for me
I don't wanna go home
But I'm starting to think
I ain't meant for this road
And my anxiety, it won't leave me alone
I know, I know, I know
I should be better than I was
Get myself together cause I'm tired of feeling numb
I hate being lonely feel like I'm nеver enough
I know, I know, I know

[Verse]
Ay
I been fucking up my sleep schedulе
And I lost track of time, I broke my bezel
Anxiety and oh yeah I'm depressed too
My bad that's probably why I just didn't text you back
I been trying to find way to help me relax
I underestimated this life, yeah it's fast
And all of the light I had in my life's fading black

Cause shits been getting dark for me
I don't wanna go home
But I'm starting to think
I ain't meant for this road
And my anxiety, it won't leave me alone
I know, I know, I know
I should be better than I was
Get myself together cause I'm tired of feeling numb
I hate being lonely feel like I'm never enough
I know, I know

[Bridge]
Bounty on my heart wanted dead or alive, yeah
I been driving far to escape from this life, yeah
Said I'd be a star way before I knew the price
Ever since I started paying I've been praying for a light

[Verse 2]
Cause shits been getting dark for me
Honestly, it's getting hard for me
I'm trying to keep my head afloat above the water
That's drowning me down
And down, woah

[Chorus]
Cause shits been getting dark for me
I don't wanna go home
But I'm starting to think
I ain't meant for this road
And my anxiety, it won't leave me alone
I know, I know, I know
I should be better than I was
Get myself together cause I'm tired of feeling numb
I hate being lonely feel like I'm never enough
I know, I know, I knowEmbed Darkside Darkside Vwillz sad
