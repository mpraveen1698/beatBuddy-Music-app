6 ContributorsSilenced by the Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
In a city like mine, there's no point in fightin'
I close my eyes, see you and me drivin'
If I am a river, you are the ocean
Got the radio on, got the wheels in motion

[Chorus]
We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then

[Verse 2]
I lie in the dark, I feel I'm fallin'
Feel your hand on my back, hear your voice callin'
I'm out of my depth, girl, stick close to me
Because the people in this town, they look straight through me

[Chorus]
We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then

[Bridge]
'Cause, baby, I'm not scared
Of this world when you're here
No, baby, I'm not scared
Of this world when you're here

Oh
You and I, we're gonna rise again
Oh
You and I, we're gonna rise again
We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to thenEmbed Silenced By The Night Strangeland Keane piano
