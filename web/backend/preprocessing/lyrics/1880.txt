25 ContributorsWeight On Me Lyrics[Intro: Sheff G]
They can't get nothin' from me
I did some things, ain't gain nothin' from it
I was locked up when they put them chains on me
(Great John on the beat, by the way)
Look, look

[Chorus: Sheff G]
I'm about makin' money
Laughin', jokin' when there's nothin' funny
You wasn't there, can't get nothin' from me
I did some things, ain't gain nothin' from it
I was locked up when they put them chains on me, huh
Mama, just pray for me
I know you stressin', just wait on me, huh
Mama, just wait on me

[Verse 1: Sleepy Hallow]
You know they ain't show no love to me
Some gon' look up to me, nigga
But fuck it, I'm coolin'
Ain't have no bag for me
Say you feel bad for me
I got the work and I moved it
Charge like a battery
Demons, they battle me
I got some pain, I might lose it
(I got some pain, I might lose it)
(I got some pain and confusion)
You might also like[Verse 2: Sheff G]
I got some niggas who sentence like essays
I put all they names in my music, huh
Pain that we put in
Never let 'em tell you that you can't, no, you couldn't
Me and you could never be the same, no, we couldn't
Get my mother rich, seen the chance and I took it
Sky was all black, never wished on a star, huh
Family proud of me now
Boy, you so dark, how you shine like a star? Huh
How you shine like a star? Huh

[Chorus: Sheff G]
Boy, I'm about makin' money
Laughin', jokin' when there's nothin' funny
You wasn't there, can't get nothin' from me
I did some things, ain't gain nothin' from it
I was locked up when they put them chains on me, huh
Mama, just pray for me
I know you stressin', just wait on me, huh
Mama, just wait on me

[Verse 3: Sleepy Hallow]
I bet they don't know how I'm feelin'
I bet they ain't real
The look in my eyes, you can tell I'm a driller
I looked up to them killers
Takin' drugs, I hope these Percs don't kill us
In my Birk', no filter, look
I want that new whip out the dealer
Gave my mama a couple of grand
I gotta move quick, can't stand up
Been through shit that you won't understand
I got some bruises won't heal up
I just hope I get better again
Say you gon' do this, you gon' do that
I ain't never see you do a thing
Gun to your head, son, like a durag
Feel a way and we bustin' your brain, look
[Verse 4: Sheff G]
You ain't gon' bust on them things
I feel like an animal no one can tame, huh
Rather the fortune than fame
But you can get fortune without all of the fame
Don't get split like a fraction
Me and my dawgs bite first, get to yappin' (Yappin')
Remember days loadin' up magazines
Now they see us, we all up in magazines

[Chorus: Sheff G]
I'm about makin' money
Laughin', jokin' when there's nothin' funny
You wasn't there, can't get nothin' from me
I did some things, ain't gain nothin' from it
I was locked up when they put them chains on me, huh
Mama, just pray for me
I know you stressin', just wait on me, huh
Mama, just wait on me10Embed Weight On Me One and Only Sheff G;Sleepy Hallow r-n-b
