God, I wish somebody would have told me when I was younger
That all bodies aren't the same
Photoshop itty bitty models on magazine covers
Told me I was overweight
I stopped eating, what a bummer
Can't have carbs and a hot girl summer
If I could go back and tell myself when I was younger
I'd say, "Psst!

[Chorus]
I know Victoria's secret
And, girl, you wouldn't believe
She's an old man who lives in Ohio
Making money off of girls like me"
Cashin' in on body issues
Sellin' skin and bones with big boobs
I know Victoria's secret:
She was made up by a dude (Dude)
Victoria was made up by a dude (Dude)
Victoria was made up by a dude

[Verse 2]
I wish somebody would've told me that thighs of thunder
Meant normal human thighs
The fuckin' pressure I was under
To lose my appetite and fight the cellulite
With Hunger Games like every night
If I could go back and tell myself when I was younger
I'd say, "Hey, dummy
You might also like[Chorus]
I know Victoria's secret
And, girl, you wouldn't believe
She's an old man who lives in Ohio
Making money off of girls like me"
Cashin' in on body issues
Sellin' skin and bones with big boobs
I know Victoria's secret:
She was made up by a dude (Dude)
Victoria was made up by a dude (Dude)
Victoria was made up by a dude

[Bridge]
I know Victoria's secret
And, girl, you wouldn't believe
She's an old man who lives in Ohio
Making money off girls like me
Cashin' in on body issues
Sellin' skin and bones with big boobs
I know Victoria's secret:
She was made up by a dude

[Chorus]
I know Victoria's secret
And, girl, you wouldn't believe
She's an old man who lives in Ohio
Making money off girls like me
Cashin' in on body issues
Sellin' skin and bones with big boobs
[Outro]

She was never made for me and you3Embed Victoria’s Secret Victoria’s Secret Jax songwriter
