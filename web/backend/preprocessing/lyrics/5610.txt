19 ContributorsThe Only Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm winning, you're losing
I'm falling, your agony
Lower than lower, before
Your forgotten memory

[Pre-Chorus]
My heaven, your hell
I'm killing your fantasy
More and more, you follow
Your deepest reality

[Chorus]
You're trying to take me
You're trying to make me
This is the only
Give me the only thing
I'm tired of trying
I'm tired of lying
The only thing I understand is what I feel

[Verse 2]
Identity, fantasy
Heresy, killing me
Lower than lower, before
This thing to feed
