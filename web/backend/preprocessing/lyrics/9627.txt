1 ContributorEnchained on the Pain Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been smoking all of my pain
Anxiety it's fucking my brain
No have a reason to wake
I smile but always it's fake

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tied all the remembers of my past
The time it really pass so fast
Many thoughts on my head, feel so bad
I can't more

[Chorus]
Nobody can see
The pain inside of me
All my broken dreams
Anxiety is ending with me
I've lost the faith
I'm here enchained
I'm a loser with this pain
This song is what I really feel
Forever I'll be enchained on the pain

[Verse 2]
I feel I'm wasting my time
I feel I'm wasting my life
I fight with this everynight
I live a mess on my mind
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm fallin' I'm depressed again
Hapiness is so far away
I'm lonely crying in the rain
I'm not okay

[Chorus]
Nobody can see
The pain inside of me
All my broken dreams
Anxiety is ending with me
I've lost the faith
I'm here enchained
I'm a loser with this pain
This song is what I really feel
Forever I'll be enchained on the pain

[Bridge]
What I made?
What's my mistake?
Since the first day
Was a mistake
Enchained
To all my sins
Living with pain
Living with pain
What I made?
What's my mistake?
Since the first day
Was a mistake
Enchained
To all my sins
Living with pain
[Chorus]
Nobody can see
The pain inside of me
All my broken dreams
Anxiety is ending with me
I've lost the faith
I'm here enchained
I'm a loser with this pain
This song is what I really feel
Forever I'll be enchained on the pain

[Outro]
Please save me, I'm so fucked up
Please help me, I'm stuck up
Please save me, I'm so fucked up
Please help me, I'm stuck up
I'm sickEmbed Far Away Far Away Lonely in the Rain french
