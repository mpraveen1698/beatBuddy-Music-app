Jason Derulo

[Verse 1]
I can't read ya, my sexy Mona Lisa
Can't tell if you gon' leave here, or if you wanna stay
Girl, just ease up, don't yell in my two-seater
You say that you a freaker, but fall asleep at eight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sheesh, but you're perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy like my mama, mama
Sheesh (Sheesh), girl, you killin' me
But you won't see me with another lover

[Chorus]
Baby, oh-oh, you just a little loco
Like boats in Acapulco, I'm just ridin' the wave
Baby, oh-oh, you just a little loco
Emotions like a yo-yo, but I love you that way

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
There's something 'bout a crazy lover
Oh
I love you that way

[Pre-Chorus]
Sheesh, but you're perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy like my mama, mama
Sheesh (Sheesh), girl, you killin' me
But you won't see me with another lover

[Chorus]

Emotions like a yo-yo, but I love you that way, yeah
