14 ContributorsSay Goodbye Lyrics[Verse]
I do so much shit for you, but yet, all you do is call out my wrongs
I am always there for you, but yet, all you do is call out when I'm gone
Just make up your mind, I don't wanna waste my time
Stop sayin' that you love me when you don't even try
I been up since the AM, bottlin' up my emotions 'cause
When I say, "What's wrong?", that's another fuckin' wrong

[Chorus]
So I'm done, say goodbye
Go ahead and cry, yeah, you had all this time
So I'm done, say goodbye
Go ahead and cry, yeah, you had all this time

[Bridge]
And I've learned you can't do this like I can
You did me dark, goddamn
And I've learned you can't do this like I can
You did me dark, goddamn

[Chorus]
So I'm done, say goodbye
Go ahead and cry, yeah, you had all this time
So I'm done, say goodbye
What's the point of tryin' now when you had all this time?
What's the point of tryin' now when you had all this time?You might also like8Embed Say Goodbye Say Goodbye Monty Datta;Sn√∏w sad
