Babe, you're too controlling
I’ma feed you to the wolves
When you get nasty, back at me
But, baby, don't distract me
I'm a goner, I lost her
Like why the hell you wanna
Play me that way? You’re bad, babe
You double-faced entendre
[Chorus]
Life goes on and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on

[Verse 2]
Babe, you best believe it
I'ma rip you up to pieces
I'm a lover, not a fighter
But I'll light this place on fire
I want it, I'm on it
But, babe, at least I'm honest
I get tired of explaining
As these seasons keep on changing
