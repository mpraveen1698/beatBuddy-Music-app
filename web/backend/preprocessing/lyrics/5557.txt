The good life is what I need
Too many people stepping over me
The only thing that's been on my mind
Is the one thing I need before I die

[Chorus]
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, oh, oh
The good life
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, oh, oh
The good life
The good life

[Verse 2]
I don't really know who I am
It's time for me to take a stand
I need a change and I need it fast
I know that any day could be the last

[Chorus]
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, oh, oh
The good life
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, oh, oh
The good life

Hold on, hold on
I always wanted it this way
We never wanted it this way
Hold on, hold on
I always wanted it this way
We didn't ask for it this way
I always wanted this way
The good life

[Chorus]
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, oh, oh
The good life
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, oh, oh
The good life
