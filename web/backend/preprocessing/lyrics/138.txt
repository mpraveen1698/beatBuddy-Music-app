"One more drink," she said
I think I'm losin' my head now
Tonight, we'll make bad memories
"One more drink," she said
We know there's no turnin' back now
We love to make bad memories

[Chorus: FAST BOY]
"One more drink," she said
I think I'm losin' my head now
Tonight, we'll make bad memories
"One more drink," she said
We know there's no turnin' back now
We love to make bad memories
"One more drink," she said
I think I'm losin' my head now
Tonight, we'll make bad memories
"One more drink," she said
I think I'm losin' my head now

[Post-Chorus: FAST BOY]
I think I'm losin' my head now, my head now
Losin' my head now, my head now
Think I'm losin' my head now, my head now
Again and again
