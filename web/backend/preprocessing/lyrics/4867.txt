8 ContributorsHot Air Balloon Lyrics[Verse 1]
My God
Are we falling through the cracks to love?
Til' we see the back of sunset
My God
We got up dancing with the past, but nobody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
I never wanna be those people
I wanna see the world keep turning round
I never wanna be those people
Be those people, nah

[Chorus]
We gon' fly to the moon
In my hot air balloon, tonight
We gon' sit on the roof
In my hot air balloon, tonight

[Drop]
We gon' fly to the moon
In my hot air balloon, tonight
We gon' sit on the roof
In my hot air balloon, tonight

[Verse 2]
My God
Running in between the cars (oh no)
Are we stepping off the sidewalk?
My God
Chasing tails in the dark whеre nobody goes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I nevеr wanna be those people
I wanna see the world keep turning round
I never wanna be those people
Be those people, nah

[Chorus]
We gon' fly to the moon
In my hot air balloon, tonight
We gon' sit on the roof
In my hot air balloon, tonight

[Drop]
We gon' fly to the moon
In my hot air balloon, tonight
We gon' sit on the roof
In my hot air balloon, tonight1Embed Hot Air Balloon FORΞVΞR (DΞLUXΞ ΞDITION) Don Diablo;AR/CO progressive-house
