Thanks, 4ME
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I just watch the rain fall down the window pane
And I just broke the bank, so baby, I make it rain
Yeah, I kick it with the savages and they gon' bring the pain
See, I'ma take this bitch and break her back in just like Bane
See, I'ma take this watch and put some diamonds in the face
And I know these niggas watchin', so you know I'm movin' safe
I could never love a thot, I'm in love with Mary Jane
Damn, my shooter love his Glock, yeah, he with it every day
Boot this bitch up off the molly, now she goin' insane
And she say she love lil' Lonely and she wanna go to space
All my teachers hated on me, gave a fuck about a grade
But I'm grinding every day, got myself up off the pavement (Oh yeah, okay)

[Verse]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah, okay)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
See we do the same thing, molly, Xans'
They not 'bout no action, them niggas just fans
We all 'bout that action, bust him and his mans
I'm rockin' designer, baby, no more Vans
Early mornin' flight, can't wait 'til I land
Turn that bitch to a dyke, fuck her and her friend
It's gon' be alright, baby, I'm the man (Oh-oh-oh)
Hate when we fight, I don't understand (Oh-oh-oh)
She ride like a bike, thumbin' through the bands (Oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, we up all night tryna get the cash (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Said we up all night tryna get a bag (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
We up all night tryna get a bag (Tryna get a bag)
We go hit the store and go and pop some tags
I might hit your ho if I think that she bad
We swipe for a mil' when we down bad (Bad)
For this shit, I would kill, never goin' back (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm still thanking God for the shit I have
'Cause each day I wake up, it could be my last (Oh, yeah, yeah)
I take these digits, count up from the back
And I still love my plug for frontin' me the gas (Yeah-yeah)
Go get a grip, baby, bring it back  (Yeah-yeah)
Can't go legit, stuck up in the trap (Okay)
Can't go legit, get money off an app
Oh yeah, oh yeah (Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah)
