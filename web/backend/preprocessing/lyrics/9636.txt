18 ContributorsNeon Lyrics[Verse 1]
When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can

[Verse 2]
Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hands

[Chorus]
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away

I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes and she goes
Like no one can
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands

[Chorus]
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes and she goes
Like no one can
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands

[Chorus]
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away10Embed Neon Room For Squares John Mayer songwriter
