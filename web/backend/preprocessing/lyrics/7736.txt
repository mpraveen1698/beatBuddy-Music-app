10 ContributorsBlind and Frozen Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once I touched your heart
Held you in closed arms
Built a haven for your love
Until I let you fall apart
Please forgive me

[Chorus]
God I miss you like hell
I was wrong I can tell
For the heart can be blind and frozen
Now I live with the pain
Every night, every day
As I read those letters you wrote me
How I long for the time
When your lips would kiss mine
And the promise was still unbroken
I will wait for tomorrow
That may never come
I will wait in the name of love

[Verse 2]
My forlorn heart faintly beats
Your absence makes me weak
And if nothing brings you back
Surely I'll roam through life in black
Like a shadow
You might also like[Chorus]
God I miss you like hell
I was wrong I can tell
For the heart can be blind and frozen
Now I live with the pain
Every night, every day
As I read those letters you wrote me
How I long for the time
When your lips would kiss mine
And the promise was still unbroken
I will wait for tomorrow
That may never come
I will wait in the name of love

[Bridge]
I would die for the love of mercy
Destiny, is this how it should be? No no no!

[Chorus]
God I miss you like hell
I was wrong I can tell
For the heart can be blind and frozen
Now I live with the pain
Every night, every day
As I read those letters you wrote me
God I miss you like hell
I was wrong I can tell
For the heart can be blind and frozen
Now I live with the pain
Every night, every day
As I read those letters you wrote me
How I long for the time
When your lips would kiss mine
And the promise was still unbroken
I will wait for tomorrow
That may never come
I will wait in the name of love2Embed Blind and Frozen Berserker Beast In Black heavy-metal
