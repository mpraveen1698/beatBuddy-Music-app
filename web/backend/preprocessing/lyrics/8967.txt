45 ContributorsFOOL’S GOLD Lyrics[Intro]
(Vice)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I was made in gold, fall asleep, this on my resume
Feelin' low, pop the ceiling, please don't hesitate
Peelin' off, chasin' racks, keep me in shape
I don't wan' wrap my mind around her every day, any night
Any way, I'ma ride for you, love, dollar signs
Pockets swole like a swine, many fold, many tried
Many go, I survived episodes I shouldn't have
Sell me some love drugs I can make an album out of
Feet up, targetin' me like a problem
Be your sovereign, what you want I got
And in my hindsight, all of this becomin' silly
If I made a milli', then my mommy madе a milli'

[Pre-Chorus]
Clearly on my next step
Took mе for a host? Why, you can be my guest
Hard to catch sunshine waitin' by my desk, yeah
You want fun times, I need nothing less

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait too long, do I have to?
A lot of racin' thoughts in my head
Messed around and played your part, send you back to him
One shot like I never miss (Tres, dos, uno)

How long can we dance for? I got many plans
In the eye of the storm, why you huggin' the fence?
I wish I'd have known, 'cause my feet grippin' the sand
Used to run with the crown, tell me
Have you seen a man down?
Picture this, I'm headed to the land now, hold my breath
Every second made me stand out
Differences between you and the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
Clearly on my next step
Took me for a host? Why, you can be my guest
Hard to catch sunshine waitin' by my desk, yeah
You want fun time- (Fun time-, fun time-)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait too long, do I have to?
Racin' thoughts in my head
Messed around and played your part (Played your part), send you back to him
One shot like I never miss (One shot like I never miss)21Embed FOOL'S GOLD BELIEVE IN ME, WHO BELIEVES IN YOU Aries sad
