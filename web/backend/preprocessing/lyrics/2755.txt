Floating free
Suspended aimlessly
Emptiness
But I don't feel a thing

[Pre-Chorus: Dave Stephens]
As soon as I've turned around
Convinced that I'm safe and sound
Feel both my feet on the ground

[Chorus: Dave Stephens]
I fall into a black hole in my head
Reach into the darkness for what's left
I'm fighting the gravity
It's pulling the worst part out of me
Black hole

[Verse 2: Caleb Shomo]
The other side, another life, chasing the great unknown
I'll never know the afterglow 'cause I can't let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Dave Stephens]
As soon as I've turned around
Convinced that I'm safe and sound
Feel both my feet on the ground
You might also like[Chorus: Dave Stephens]
I fall into a black hole in my head
Reach into the darkness for what's left
I'm fighting the gravity
It's pulling the worst part out of me
Black hole

[Bridge: Caleb Shomo]
As soon as I've turned around
Convinced that I'm safe and sound
Feel both my feet on the ground

[Chorus: Dave Stephens]
I fall into a black hole in my head
Reach into the darkness for what's left
I'm fighting the gravity
It's pulling the worst part out of me
I fall into a black hole in my head
Sinking in the words I left unsaid
I'm fighting the gravity
It's pulling the worst part out of me

[Outro: Dave Stephens]
