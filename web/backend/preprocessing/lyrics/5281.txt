4 ContributorsTwo Places At Once Lyrics[Verse 1]
You said you're findin' yourself
It's not about anyone else
You just want the best
But I know you meant
You don't want the rest

[Verse 2]
Said it's all up to the Universe
'Cause you can't just say the words
You're not willin' to try
But you can't decide
Think I can read between the lines

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you always know all the answers
But you can't seem to make up your damn mind

[Chorus]
You don't want me now, you might want me later
You leave out the truth, don't want me to hate ya
It's not our time but I'm the one
You want it all, now you got none
I won't wait around for you in December
So go have your fun and I'll just remеmber
How I've been yours for months
And you're in two placеs at once
You might also like[Verse 3]
You said you wouldn't define
Us by a ten hour flight
I'd be out of your sight
But still in your mind
And we could talk when we had time

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you said that we'd stay together
So somethin' must've happened overnight

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't want me now, you might want me later
You leave out the truth, don't want me to hate ya
It's not our time but I'm the one
You want it all, now you got none
I won't wait around for you in December
So go have your fun and I'll just remember
How I've been yours for months
And you're in two places at once

[Bridge]
I always knew you're a planner
So did you know and just keep it inside?

[Chorus]
You don't want me now, you might want me later
You leave out the truth, don't want me to hate ya
It's not our time but I'm the one
This was our chance, you messed it up
'Cause I won't wait around for you in December
You're in a new town, guess you don't remember
How it felt being us
I'll still be yours for months, oh-oh
