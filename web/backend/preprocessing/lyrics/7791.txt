4 ContributorsPaper Planes Lyrics[Intro]
We're never looking back
We are the runaways
We fly, we fly free like a paper plane

[Verse 1]
I see them pointing their fingers
But we're never gonna do as we're told
We are painting by numbers
Chasing rainbows like we're looking for gold

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the oceans, through the desert
Cross the mountains on a hundred fields of gold
We were born to be legends
But we chose to take the beaten road

[Chorus]
We're never looking back
We are the runaways
We try, we try never to stay the same
When skies are turning black
We're dancing in the rain
We fly, we fly free like a paper plane

[Drop]
We fly, we fly free like a paper plane
We fly, we fly free like a paper plane

Dark clouds on the horizon
But I'm safe inside the back of your mind, yeah
We say goodbye to the ones we were
Then we leave all of our troubles behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the oceans, through the desert
Cross the mountains on a hundred fields of gold
We were born to be legends
But we chose to take the beaten road

[Chorus]
We're never looking back
We are the runaways
We try, we try never to stay the same
When skies are turning black
We're dancing in the rain
We fly, we fly free like a paper plane

[Bridge]
We are the runaways

[Drop]
We fly, we fly free like a paper plane
We fly, we fly free like a paper plane
[Outro]
We are the runaways
We fly, we fly free like a paper planeEmbed Paper Planes Paper Planes Lucas & Steve;Tungevaag progressive-house
