Yeah

[Chorus]
You ever wonder why-y-y-y-y? (Why)
Why-y-y-y-y? Why-y-y-y-y?
You ever wonder why-y-y-y-y? (Why)
Why-y-y-y-y? Why-y-y-y-y?

[Verse 1]
Said the lady with the long legs in the lawn chair
She like the strings on my guitar neck and my blonde hair
I write about her thighs in my latest lines
I remember her eyes when I asked her why
Why would you pay for this apartment you don't belong in?
You take this shit from all your bosses and all your boyfriends
I guess I get surprised when you let it slide
But it's no business of mine how you waste your time
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't crash, don't text, go renew your tags
No sex, no sleep, just that job
I bet you miss what you had
You can't get no sleep at night
Do you ever wonder why everyone is out to get you every day
Or do you question anything?
How many warnin' signs 'til it hits you, darling?
Gravity's your friend
You fall out of touch sometime
But your history calls you back to it again
Too many factors to be sure
So many reasons to think twice
And nobody asked you to before

But do you ever wonder why-y-y-y-y? (Why)
Why-y-y-y-y? Why-y-y-y-y?
You ever wonder why-y-y-y-y? (Why)
Why-y-y-y-y? Why-y-y-y-y?

[Outro]
You ever wonder why?
Why, why?21Embed Why What Could Possibly Go Wrong Dominic Fike alternative
