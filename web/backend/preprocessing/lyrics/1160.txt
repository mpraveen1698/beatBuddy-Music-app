What you thought was your daddy was nothing but aâ€¦
While you were sitting home alone at age thirteen
Your real daddy was dyin'
Sorry you didn't see him, but I'm glad we talked"

Hey, oh, oh-oh

Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare
[Chorus]
I, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive, yeah

"You're still alive," she said, oh, and do I deserve to be?

Yeah, I, ooh, I'm still alive!
