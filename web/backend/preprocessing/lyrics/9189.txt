29 ContributorsTwo Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sweetheart, you look a little tired
When did you last eat?
Come in and make yourself right at home
Stay as long as you need
Tell me, is something wrong?
If something's wrong, you can count on me
You know I'll take my heart clean apart, if it helps yours beat

[Pre-Chorus]
It's okay if you can't find the words
Let me take your coat
And this weight off of your shoulders

[Chorus]
Like a force to be reckoned with
A mighty ocean or a gentle kiss
I will love you with every single thing I have
Like a tidal wave, we'll make a mess
Or calm waters, if that serves you best
I will love you without any strings attached

[Post-Chorus]
It's okay if you can't catch your breath
You can take the oxygen straight out of my own chest
You might also like[Verse 2]
I know exactly how the rule goes:
Put my mask on first
No, I don't want to talk about myself
Tell me where it hurts
I just want to build you up, build you up
'Til you're good as new
And maybe one day I will get around to fixing myself too

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't even know where to start
Already tired of trying to recall when it all fell apart
I just want to love you, to love you, to love you well
I just want to learn how, somehow, to be loved myself

[Chorus]
Like a force to be reckoned with
A mighty ocean or a gentle kiss
I will love you without any strings attached
And what a privilege it is to love
A great honor to hold you up
Like a force to be reckoned with
A mighty ocean or a gentle kiss
I will love you with every single thing I have
Like a tidal wave, I'll make a mess
Or calm waters if that serves you best
I will love you without any strings attached
I will love you without a single string attached14Embed Two Atlas: Enneagram Sleeping At Last ambient
