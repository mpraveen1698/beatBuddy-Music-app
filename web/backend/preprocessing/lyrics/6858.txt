One, two, one, two, three
Lend me your ears

[Verse 1]
Hey, where'd you go?
Could've sworn that you were sleepin' over
Say, I don't know
But I thought that we were starting over

[Chorus]
Like we always do
Like we always do
Was I a fool?
To think that we always would
(Yes or no? This is your last chance, no beating around the bush)

[Verse 2]
Gone, not a trace
And it's almost like it never happened
No, not the same
Guess it hurt me more than I imagined

[Chorus]
We always do
Like we always do
Was I a fool?
To think that we always would

[Chorus]
Like we always do
Like we always do
Was I a fool?
To think that we always would2Embed always always keshi chill
