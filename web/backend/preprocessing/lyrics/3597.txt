9 Contributorsâ€‹not my job anymore Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna make assumptions, but it looks like from the picture you posted
That you're actually unhappy, but you think that nobody can notice

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe it's all in my head
And maybe it's just 'cause I know you so well
But you don't stop loving someone just 'cause it's over
And I just wanna say, are you okay?

[Chorus]
Wish I could be the one that you call too much
At 4:00 AM 'cause you can't stop crying
Drive you home when you get too drunk and you say you're fine
But I know you're lying
Wish I could be the thing you need
And I could come and save you like before
Oh, but that's not my job anymore

[Verse 2]
If I'm being honest, I know I made the right decision
It hurts letting go, but it hurt more keeping that position
'Cause I gave it all to you when you asked me to, but some things I can't fix
Oh, some things I can't fix

[Chorus]
Wish I could be the one that you call too much
At 4:00 AM 'cause you can't stop crying
Drive you home when you get too drunk and you say you're fine
But I know you're lying
Wish I could be the thing you need
And I could come and save you like before
Oh, but that's not my job anymore

[Chorus]
Wish I could be the one that you call too much
At 4:00 AM 'cause you can't stop crying
Drive you home when you get too drunk and you say you're fine
But I know you're lying
Wish I could be the thing you need
And I could come and save you like before
But that's not my job anymoreEmbed not my job anymore not my job anymore Thomas Day singer-songwriter
