I stared up at the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things I've loved
I stared up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me

[Pre-Chorus]
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea, yeah
You can see your life out of the window tonight

[Chorus]
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I lose myself tonight
Whoa, yeah, yeah
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I woke up with the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things I've loved
I woke up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me
