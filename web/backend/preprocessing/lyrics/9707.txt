43 ContributorsKILL4ME Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let's grab our gold switchblade
And make us a blood pact, babe
To love and to fuck
And to only see ourselves
And remember this

[Pre-Chorus]
Your hotel room won't be so vacant
And I can tell that you ain't faking
Because I take death threats
Like the best of them

[Chorus]
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me
Kill, kill, kill for me

[Verse 2]
Bloody noses are just like roses
But what happens when we are betrayed?
Would you drag him to the shed
And unload six rounds in their fucking face?
This is our sacrifice
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Your hotel-heart won't be so vacant
And I can tell that you ain't faking
Because I take death threats
Like the best of them

[Chorus]
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me

[Bridge]
Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?
Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?
Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?

[Chorus]
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me
Kill, kill, kill for me
Kill, kill, kill for me
[Outro]
Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?17Embed KILL4ME Heaven Upside Down Marilyn Manson industrial
