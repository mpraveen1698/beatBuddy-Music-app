8 ContributorsWalked In Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah (Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Uh, okay I, yeah (Whatcha got?)
Okay I, yeah (Ayo, Whit)

[Chorus]
Okay I walked in looking like a whole damn lick
So much money on me, told your bitch to hold my shit, uh
Ice on me cold, got me frozer than a bitch
They like to hate but don't know how much work we put in
Okay I pull up, uh, don't know why they think they know us (Know us)
Used to hate now they say that boy Kev gon' blow up (Blow up)
The money ain't gon' change us
Never been a lame and I'm still with the gang, yeah

[Verse]
Every time I walk through, I got gang behind me
And I don't like the talk boo, you know where to find me
And if he like to talk rude, I'ma get him knocked out
I'm trying to cop me a glizzy, ain't talking hot dog
Fuck all the talking, let's do it, uh (Okay)
Bitch, I'm the shit and they knew it, uh (Okay)
I need my funds, came from the mud
I love my brothers, I treat them like blood (Okay)
Don't get it twisted, I came for the racks
She fallin' in love while I'm breaking the bank
Shawty so bad but I can't get attached
She think I'm the one, but I told her relax
Yeah, yeah, in my bag
Bitch I pulled up, faded
She think that I'm famous
Turnt up all the time
This what we say when we made it (Yeah, yeah)
