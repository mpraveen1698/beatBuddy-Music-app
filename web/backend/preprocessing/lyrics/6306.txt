2 ContributorsMove Me LyricsVerse 1:
I'm standing here in the city of isolation
Like chasing the wind without a destination
But I know You're here, 'cause You said that You'd meet me here
The earth begins to shake and Lord I wonder if it's You
Reveal Yourself to me 'cause I'm not gonna move

Chorus:
I know You can calm the sea, push back the ocean
I know You can hide the moon, hold still the sun
I know You can break down walls, and move the mountains
I know that You can move me, move me, move me
I know that You can move me, move me, move me

Verse 2:
Surrounded by doubt, in a sea of desperation
Searching for more than the familiar face of deception
So I'm crying out, 'cause I know that You meet me here
So send Your fire, Lord consume the trenches of my heart
And burn a light inside that leads to where You are

Chorus:
I know You can calm the sea, push back the ocean
I know You can hide the moon, hold still the sun
I know You can break down walls, and move the mountains
I know that You can move me, move me, move me
I know that You can move me, move me, move me

Here I stand on the mountain, Lord, don't pass me by
I have chased the wind and I've been through the fire
And when my world was shaken and I tried to hide
You gently whispered I am by your side

Chorus:
I know You can calm the sea, push back the ocean
I know You can hide the moon, hold still the sun
I know You can break down walls, and move the mountains
I know that You can move me, move me, move me

Chorus:
I know You can calm the sea, push back the ocean
I know You can hide the moon, hold still the sun
I know You can break down walls, and move the mountains
I know that You can move me, move me, move me
I know that You can move me, move me, move me

I know that You can move me, move me, move me
I know that You can move me, move me, move meEmbed Move Me Move Me Lavern french
