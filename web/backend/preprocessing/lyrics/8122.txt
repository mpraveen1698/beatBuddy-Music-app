Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up

[Verse 1]
We've both been sound asleep
Wake up, little Susie, and weep
The movie's over
It's four o'clock
And we're in trouble deep

[Chorus]
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

[Verse 2]
Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell all our friends
When they say, "Ooh la la!"

[Chorus]
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

[VERSE 3]
Well, I told your mama that
You'd be in by ten
Well, Susie, baby
Looks like we goofed again
You might also likeWake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
We gotta go home

[Chorus]
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up

[VERSE 4]
The movie wasn't so hot
It didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep
Our goose is cooked
Our reputation is shot

[Chorus]
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

[VERSE 5]
Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say, "Ooh la la!"

[Chorus]
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
