7 ContributorsCall Me the Breeze Lyrics[Intro]
Every one of the ol' rock 'n' roll favorites, "Breeze"
Shuffle on down to Broadway
One, two, one, two

[Verse 1]
They call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
They call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I ain't carrying me no load

[Verse 2]
Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no change in me
Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no change in me
I ain't hidin' from nobody
Ain't nobody hidin' from me

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
I got that green light, babe
I got to keep moving on
I got that green light, babe
I got to keep moving on
I might go out to California
Might go down to Georgia
Might stay homeYou might also like2Embed Call Me The Breeze Naturally J.J. Cale blues
