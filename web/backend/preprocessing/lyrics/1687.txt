34 ContributorsYouâ€™re Gonna Live Forever in Me Lyrics[Whistling Intro]

[Verse 1]
A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

[Refrain]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee
Just wait and see

[Verse 2]
Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

[Refrain]
And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee
It's your destiny

[Verse 3]
Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree
You might also like[Refrain]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee
It's just meant to be
[Whistling Break]

[Verse 4]
And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat

[Refrain]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee
Just wait and see
