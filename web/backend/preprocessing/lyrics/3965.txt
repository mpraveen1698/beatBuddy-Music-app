10 ContributorsThe End Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's hard to tell these days in which way that we’re falling
I'm not sure anymore what's right or what is wrong
It hurts to feel, to think, to know I may be nothing
But then again, I’ve been wrong before

[Pre-Chorus]
I've opened up my eyes
Just to wish that I'd stayed blind

[Chorus]
Blacken out the sky
And let the arrows fly
It's never over
Not 'til it's over
Outside looking in
When do the nightmares end?
Over and over
Until it's over
The end

[Verse 2]
It's hard to fathom
Just how fast we all are spinning
It’s hard to know
That there’s a heaven bеyond hell
It burns a hole right through my soul
To think it's ending
But thеn again
I’ve been right before

I've opened up my eyes
Just to find out you're all blind

[Chorus]
Blacken out the sky
And let the arrows fly
It's never over
Not ’til it's over
Outside looking in
When do the nightmares end?
Over and over
Until it's over

[Bridge]
Make a wish, say a prayer
Hope that someone is out there
Build a bridge to Babylon
Then burn it to the ground
Make a wish, say a prayer
Hope that someone is out there
Build a bridge to Babylon
Then burn it to the ground
(Burn it to the ground)
Burn it to the ground
(Burn it to the ground)
Burn it to the ground
(Burn it to the ground)
Build a bridge to Babylon
Then burn it, burn it, burn it down
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Blacken out the sky
And let the arrows fly
It's never over
Not 'til it's over
Outside looking in
When do the nightmares end?
Over and over
Until it's over

[Outro]
Just start it over
Until it's over
Over and over
The end
