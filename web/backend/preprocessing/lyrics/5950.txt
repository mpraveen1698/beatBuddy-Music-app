3 ContributorsSunsick Lyrics[Verse]
I made a couple friends last night
Woke up to see the sun staring in my face
I won't go back to bed this time
I been dreaming 'bout a day to go run away

[Refrain]
My life gets pretty boring
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I waste so many mornings
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Someone says drive there, I'm ready to go
Backseat ride, get my head out the door
Sunsick times on my mind, woah-oh-oh
Someone says drive there, I'm ready to go
Backseat ride, get my head out the door
Sunsick times on my mind, woah-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
Gotta get a toe on the clutch when I'm whippin' the rеntal
Talk too much, got a lot on my mental
Stay for a month on the west of thе central, ooh
