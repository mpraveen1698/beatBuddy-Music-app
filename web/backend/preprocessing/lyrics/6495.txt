Saw you on the side of the road
I could see you were walkin' slow
Drinkin' a Slurpee
In a peach baseball cap
Fallin' in my lap
You were so thirsty

[Pre-Chorus]
Could you love me instead
Of all the boyfriends you get?
Know I'd make you forget
About all of those rich fuckboys

[Chorus]
Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me

[Verse 2]
You always bite your lip
When you're feelin' it
As we move slowly
And your peach baseball cap
Is tossed under the rack
Of clothes and your jewelry

And you beg for it
In the morning again
Before you go to the gym
Said it's a bad habit you just can't quit

[Chorus]
Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
