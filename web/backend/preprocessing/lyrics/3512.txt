6 ContributorsUnloving You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I want all of my nights back
When you were callin' me, cryin'
You were fallin' apart
And I said, "darling, I'm right there"
Grab my keys off the nightstand
And I drove through the dark, mm-mm

[Pre-Chorus]
But that was then and this is now, and while
You're movin' on, I'm breakin' down tonight
And in the end, no matter how hard I try

[Chorus]
Unloving you is so hard to do
It's like trying to fight the rising tide
It's like catching the moon
Or telling the stars not to shine
Yeah, unloving you, I must be a fool
'Cause only a fool would waste their time
On somebody who has already moved on with their life

[Verse 2]
I want all of my flights back
When you were goin' to college
Promise we'd make it work
Threw all my clothes in a backpack
Twelve hundred miles just so I could say "I love you" in person Hmm, mm

[Chorus]
Unloving you is so hard to do
It's like trying to fight the rising tide
It's like catching the moon
Or telling the stars not to shine, oh
Yeah, unloving you, I must be a fool
'Cause only a fool would waste their time
On somebody who has already moved on with their life

[Post-Chorus]
Somebody help me, somebody help me
This isn't healthy
Don't know what to do
Can't make it through, unloving you3Embed Unloving You Unloving You Anson Seabra singer-songwriter
