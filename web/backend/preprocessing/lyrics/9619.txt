19 ContributorsDrugs Lyrics[Verse 1]
The walls reek of blue and green
As the yellow sun comes up
But she don't like red
Reminds her much of rust
She takes her time
With golden angel dust

[Chorus]
She likes drugs
She likes drugs

[Verse 2]
She dreams in black and white
I want her to get out
The red fern grows
Just like the body count
Her summer hair
Color washes out

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1 Reprise]
The walls reek of blue and green
As the yellow sun comes up
But she don't like red
Reminds her much of rust
She takes her time
With golden angel dustYou might also like3Embed Drugs M.A.G.S. M.A.G.S. garage
