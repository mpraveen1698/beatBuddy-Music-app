12 ContributorsGlass Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
I didn't think to question the blissful truth
That your intentions were all pretend and
This sinking feeling's you
I'm feeling exhausted, I just wanna be free
To claw myself from death's front door
And not let him capture me

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't help but say
That we should know better, we should know better, and I
I just can't help but feel like
We should know better

[Chorus]
Maybe if I take back what you meant to me
Just like you took my self-belief
It's like a war I fight inside myself
I always lose and I can't help
Fall for the beating of my glass heart
The beating of my glass heart

[Verse 2]
I finally agree, I'm a mess, I confess
To the lies and my mistakes
They convulse till they scream and they cry
'Cause I feel so exhausted, I just wanna be free
To drag myself from death's front door
And not let him capture me
You might also like[Chorus]
Maybe I should take back what you meant to me
Just like you took my self-belief
It's like a war I fight inside myself
I always lose and I can't help
Fall for the beating of my glass heart
The beating of my glass heart

[Post-Chorus]
We should know better
We should know better
We should know better
We should know better

[Bridge]
And if you think that saying sorry can make it all okay
Then you're the one mistaken, I'll put you in your place

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't help but say
That we should know better, we should know better, and I
I just can't help but feel like
We should know better

[Chorus]
Maybe if I take back what you meant to me
Take back what you meant to me
Just like you took my self-belief
It's like a war I fight inside myself
I always lose and I can't help
Fall for the beating of my glass heart
The beating of my glass heart
[Outro]
We should know better
We should know better
We should know better
We should know better2Embed Glass Heart Lost Souls Caskets metal
