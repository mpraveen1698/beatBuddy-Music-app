If it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges
If it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges

If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges
For racks, I'll risk it
Me plus Hunch, that's violent siblings
Sliding, ride on the opp then bill it
Get me a drop, I'll draw that bait
Tryna turn man off, broad day on the mains
Do it and dash, don't leave no trace
Ain't corn in the ends so we go up

If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges
For racks, I'll risk it
Me plus Hunch, that's violent siblings
Sliding, ride on the opp then bill it
Get me a drop, I'll draw that bait
Tryna turn man off, broad day on the mains
Do it and dash, don't leave no trace
Ain't corn in the ends so we go up

If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges
For racks, I'll risk it
Me plus Hunch, that's violent siblings
Sliding, ride on the opp then bill it
Get me a drop, I'll draw that bait
Tryna turn man off, broad day on the mains
Do it and dash, don't leave no trace
Ain't corn in the ends so we go up
