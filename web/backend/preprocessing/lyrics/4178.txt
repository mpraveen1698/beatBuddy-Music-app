25 ContributorsAinâ€™t Nobody Lyrics[Verse 1]
Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

[Refrain]
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

[Verse 2]
I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
You filled my heart with a kiss
Ya gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

[Refrain]
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh
You might also like[Chorus]
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

[Verse 3]
I wait for night time to come
To bring you to me
I can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

[Refrain]
I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you
[Bridge]
At first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
On a night so warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most would treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you19Embed Ain't Nobody Epiphany: The Best of Chaka Khan, Vol. 1 Chaka Khan disco
