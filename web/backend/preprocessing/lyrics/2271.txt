Watch me run, watch me run away
Got no ties left to yesterday
I know who I was, put me here now
I got no intention to slow down
Burn my past in the fireplace
From the ashes, I rise again
Looking at the future, it's so bright
I'm gonna make it mine, gonna make it mine

[Pre-Chorus: Momo]
Show you how I do
Out here making these moves
Ain't here to play

[Chorus: Nayeon, Jihyo, Dahyun]
You ain't ready for it
Watch me go, watch me go rule the world
Know you never doubted, baby
I'ma go run the whole universe
Baby, I was born to rule
Yeah, I'm the queen, I'm the queen
And it's all because of you
That I'm the queen of hearts

[Verse 2: Mina, Chaeyoung, Tzuyu, Dahyun]
See it clear as day, dreaming 'bout the way
One day, I would rule the world
Now that I'm surrounded by all my girls
We be shining bright like diamonds and pearls (Hey, hey, hey)
You all made it like a movement, yeah
Take a bow up on the stage
All my friends know how to do it
And you can do it too, just follow, hey
You're making me shine today (Yeah, you can do it, hey)
Yeah, I do this everyday, oh

Feel so lucky just to have ya, ah
