Now that you're gone, it's been a long, lonely time
It's a long, sad, lonely time
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind
It's a strange, old state of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories, they mess with my mind
Who am I to deny?

[Chorus]
She was so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So bad at being in love

[Verse]
Now that you're gone, it's been a long, lonely time
It's a long, sad, lonely time
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind
It's a strange, old state of mind
