1 ContributorTake a Pic Lyrics[Intro: Koujas]
(Wait, Han made this)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Koujas]
She wanna take a pic
Bitch I'm the one, real shit
They like "you been poppin' shit"
Takin' all these trips, blowin' on za' out the zip
Hey, too many hoes like this
She like "boy, you fly as shit"
Make a deposit real quick

[Verse 1: Koujas]
She say we perfect, I feel like we breakin'
I took a perc, for the half, I break it
Know you deserve it, know I'm not perfect
I pour a eighth in my cup like Laker
I pass a bitch to my twin like Baker
Hop on a beat by Han, I kill it
Bitch I'm high, er than the ceilin'
She like "you give me that feelin'"
Glock on me play Kiss And Tell
Sing like The Weeknd
I told the bitch "I wish you well
But you been tweakin'"
She said every time we fight it feel the same
She know I'm a dog, she can't contain
I want a bust down bitch, no plain
Pickin' through these hoes, no I can't choose
Like I just want, you and you
You bad too

Uh, let's go, uh, let's go
Set them up, uh
I'm goin' so muhfuckin' up
Yo' bitch on my dick, that ho on my nuts
Damn, I'm goin' so muhfuckin' up
She likin' my swag, she say that wassup
Don't play wit' Kouj, 'cause I keep it tucked
She said what I love? I love the drugs
I swear I ain't never fell in love
Sometime I just need a hug
She got a fat ass, back it up
I'ma just switch the flow up
Nigga don't get caught up
Uh, nigga don't get caught up
We sendin' them shots, nigga, send you up
Boy, you is a bitch, I'll beat you up
Want some smoke, I'll light us up
She wanna take a picture for the gram
Black ho, [?], I swear that she tryna post me on the spam
Damn

[Chorus: Koujas]
She wanna take a pic
Bitch I'm the one, real shit
They like "you been poppin' shit"
Takin' all these trips, blowin' on za' out the zip
Hey, too many hoes like this
She like "boy, you fly as shit"
[Outro]
Fly as shit, she like you so fly as shit
Fly, fly, you fly as shit
Fly, you fly as shit
