2 ContributorsStop This Flame (Celeste x MK) Lyrics[Intro]
Fall back out, back out, I'll give you anything
Fall back out, back out, I'll give you anything

[Verse 1]
My heart goes up, my heart goes down
We fall in love and we fall back out
I'll give you anything you want, anything you want
Anything, anything, just don't tell me no
You stop it still, then you make it rush
You're like a pill that I just can't trust

[Buildup]
You tell me to stop, but I keep on going
Tell me to stop, but I keep on going
Keep on going
Tell me to stop, but I keep on going
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on

[Chorus]
You'll never stop this flame
I will never let you go
Well, who am I to say?
Maybe by now you should know
You've got your somebody calling
You think you're somebody, don't you?
I think you're scared of keeping somebody close
You'll never stop this flame
I will never let you go

Wasn't it enough?
Or did I move too far?
It's all too much
I think I must be mad to give you
Everything I had
Everything I had
Everything, everything
But it still went bad

[Bridge]
Tell me to stop, but I keep on going
Tell me to stop, but I keep on going
Tell me to stop, but I keep on going
Keep on, keep on, keep on going
Keep away from me if you can't withstand my love
Keep away from me, away from me if you think you must

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got your somebody calling
You think you're somebody, don't you?
I think you're scared of keeping somebody close
You'll neverâ€”

[Buildup]
Keep on going
Tell me to stop, but I keep on going
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on
[Chorus]
You'll never stop this flame
I will never let you go
Well, who am I to say?
Maybe by now you should know
You've got your somebody calling
You think you're somebody, don't you?
I think you're scared of keeping somebody close
You'll never stop this flame
I will never let you go

[Outro]
Fall back out, back out, I'll give you anything
Fall back out, back out, I'll give you anything
Fall back out, back out, I'll give you anything
Fall back out, back out, I'll give you anything
Fall back out, back out, I'll give you anything
Fall back out, back out, I'll give you anything
Fall back out, back out, I'll give you anything
Fall back out, back out, I'll give you anythingEmbed Stop This Flame - Celeste x MK Stop This Flame (Celeste x MK) Celeste;MK british
