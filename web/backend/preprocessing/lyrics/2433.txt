Oh, we almost got away, we've cut it close
The city's getting loud
If I choke, it's only 'cause I'm scared to be alone
Been trying to work it out, you should know

[Chorus]
I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)

Living in a movie I've watched and
Funny, 'cause you couldn't have called it (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like

Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like
Living in a movie I've watched and
Funny, 'cause you couldn't have called it (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like

Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like

[Outro]
I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment
Met you at the right time
