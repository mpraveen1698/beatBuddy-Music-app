3 ContributorsRule The World Lyrics[Verse 1]
Turn your phone off
I'll take you to a place
Where no one knows us, yeah
Maybe we messed up
But we got all we need
And tonight, we rule the world

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can taste tequila
On your tongue right now
Yeah, we're goin' down, hell yeah
'Cause the way you got me feelin'
We could run this town
I can feel you now, hell yeah

[Chorus]
We go, we go so hard until it hurts
We don't ever say no, we never learn
Yeah, well, tomorrow, we can watch it burn
But tonight, wе rule the world
