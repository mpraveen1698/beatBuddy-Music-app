14 ContributorsSword From The Stone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well how ya doing darling
How you getting on
Any horses running
Worth betting on
How’s the weather down there
I hope you’re keeping warm

[Verse 2]
How you feeling sweetheart
Are you moving on
Are you sleeping ok
Or do the nights go on and on
I hope you’re eating well
I hope you’re staying strong

[Chorus]
‘Cos I’m fine and then I’m not
I’m spinning ‘round and I can't stop
I can’t do this alone
For time flies then it’s so slow
I’m up and down like a yoyo
I can’t do it on my own
And I’ve tried and I can’t pull the sword from the stone

[Verse 3]
How are your Mum and Dad
How’s your Brother too
My folks are holding up
My sister’s pulling through
And both the cats say hi
I know they miss you too

For time flies then it's so slow
I'm up and down like a yoyo
I can't do it on my own
'Cause I've tried and I can't pull the sword from the stone

[Chorus]
Because I'm fine, then I’m not
I'm spinning 'round and I can't stop
I can't do this alone
Time flies then it's so slow
I'm up and down like a yoyo
I can't do it on my own
See I've tried and I can't pull the sword from the stone5Embed Sword from the Stone Songs for the Drunk and Broken Hearted (Deluxe) Passenger folk
