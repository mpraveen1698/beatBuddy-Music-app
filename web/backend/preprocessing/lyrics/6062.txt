21 Contributors90s Kids Lyrics[Intro]
Woah-oh-oh
Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s

[Verse 1]
It's our generation, we need conversation
In a nation with no communication
A little easy baked, and
We're kind of lost, yeah
But we're on a break, man
Rachel and Ross said

[Pre-Chorus]
We're going down with the ship, Leonardo
Put on your 'Boks and your Docs and we'll kick it at the bar
No cash, but we turn it up to ten though
Fam, I'm just tryna get super smashed, Nintendo

[Chorus]
So, light it up, up, we're hella fucked up
Take a hit, me one more time like Britney, bitch
Bottoms up, up, herе's to us
Tell 'em that we do it for thе '90s kids
Woah-oh-oh
Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s kids
Woah-oh-oh
Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s

Chillin' on the rooftop
S'mores and Bratz Dolls
Wait, s'more-what?
You're killing me, Smalls
(You're killing me, Smalls)

[Pre-Chorus]
We're going down with the ship, Leonardo
Put on your 'Boks and your Docs and we'll kick it at the bar
No cash, but we turn it up to ten though
Fam, I'm just tryna get super smashed, Nintendo

[Chorus]
So, light it up, up, we're hella fucked up
Take a hit, me one more time like Britney, bitch
Bottoms up, up, here's to us
Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s kids
Woah-oh-oh
Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s kids
Woah-oh-oh
Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s

[Bridge]
Do you got a Tamagotchi?
Like, a real Tamagotchi
'Cause you know I tama-got you
If you tama-got me
Oh no, it died
[Chorus]
So, light it up, up, we're hella fucked up
Take a hit, me one more time like Britney, bitch
Bottoms up, up, here's to us
Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s kids
Woah-oh-oh
Tell 'em that we do it for the '90s kids
Woah-oh-oh
Tell 'em that we do it for the '90sEmbed 90s Kids 90s Kids Jax singer-songwriter
