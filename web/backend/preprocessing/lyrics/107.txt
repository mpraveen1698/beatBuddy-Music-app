Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
I'll never let you down, baby
(It's Dwilly and Yung Gravy)
Uh, ayy

[Verse 1]
With your baby mama at the crib, I blow her back out
Shawty Filipino and she call me Manny Pacquiao
Alley Oop without the hoop, they call me Jerry Stackhouse
Dazin' out in public, but your mama made me snap out
'Fore I get the dough, I got the morning routine
Wake up bright and early to some brand new cream
Floss three times, baby, I'm so clean
Gravy got cheese, now, that's poutine (Woah, baby)
Gravy coming hot like I'm hoppin' off the griddle
Pull up on thе kid if you're tryna get belittlеd
All the mamas love me, now I think I'm peanut brittle
Flex the rainbow, bag it like some Skittles

[Pre-Chorus]
Gravy, why you out of pocket? (Out of pocket)
Stop it (No, no)
I'm gettin' money, Gravy Crockett
Drop it
See Yung Gravy LiveGet tickets as low as $56You might also like[Chorus]
Never take an L no more
Never take a damn thing slow
All I know is chase this dough and get money (Get the money, get the money)
Never gonna take no loss
Never gonna lose my sauce
All I know is chase this (Woah), and get money (Gettin' money, gettin' money, gettin' money)

[Interlude]
Get money
Probably into the early morning
Or get money
Yeah, I live the fast life (Woah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you know I live the fast life
I don't got a type, baby, I'm the cash type
Still gettin' dividends from a past life
I get your daddy's net worth on a bad night
'Cause I act right
Yeah, I'm rockin' Rick, clappin' Astleys like the 80s
Never give it up until the reaper come and slay me
Pull up with a Zelda and a Peach and a Daisy
I be dirty dancin', now they yellin' "Gravy Swayze"

[Bridge]
Damn, Gravy, you so vicious (Ooh)
You so clean and so delicious (So delicious)
How come you ain't got no missus?
Count that paper, count them riches
[Chorus]
Never take an L no more
Never take a damn thing slow
All I know is chase this dough and get money (Get the money, get the money)
Never gonna take no loss
Never gonna lose my sauce
All I know is chase this (Woah), and get money (Gettin' money, gettin' money, gettin' money)

[Outro]
Get money
Get money, Gravy, get money
I get money, woah
Get money
Get money, Gravy, get money
I get money, woah
