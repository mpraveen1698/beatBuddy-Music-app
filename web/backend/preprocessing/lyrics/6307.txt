Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight, but I will fight 'til the end
This one might be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle, but you feel so LA

[Pre-Chorus]
LA-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Chorus]
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible
Oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I love the way (Yeah), I love the way (Yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (Yeah), I love the way (Yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it, baby, I'm talking no inflation
Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love a f-f-four letter name

[Pre-Chorus]
Name-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Chorus]
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible
Oh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I love the way (Yeah), I love the way (Yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (Yeah), I love the way (Yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
[Bridge]
You're second-hand smoke, second-hand smoke
I breathe you in, but, honey, I don't know
What you're doing to me,  mon ch√©ri
But the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war

[Chorus]
And I still love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible
Oh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I love the way (Yeah), I love the way (Yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (Yeah), I love the way (Yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby98Embed Irresistible American Beauty/American Psycho Fall Out Boy emo
