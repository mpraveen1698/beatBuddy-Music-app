Come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over

[Verse 1]
Come on over, cut some shapes
Get it right up in my space
And shake it
Just shake it
Dance a little, move some more
Push it back down to the floor
And shake it
Just shake it
Looking deep into my eyes
Bend it back and do your best
To break it
To break it
Girl you really look the part
Reach right out you've got my heart
Now take it
Just take it, take it, take it

Girl you really look the part
Reach right out you've got my heart
