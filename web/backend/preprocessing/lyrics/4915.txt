Oh, I missed you and I cried
But I said that I was alright
And I know it's been a while
Since I needed a distraction

[Pre-Chorus]
’Cause I wanna do everything
That you want me to, to tell you the truth
I need to stay alive
So sad that I could die

[Chorus]
It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it’s not enough
Missin' you only, ever since we fell in love

[Verse 2]
And I watched you do a line
That you spread out on the table
I don't need to see you wired
I just wanna see you upside down

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna do everything
That you want me to, to tell you the truth
I listen to you cry all night
Through the telephone

It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only, ever since we fell in love

[Verse 3]
Couldn't say you didn’t want me then
When we were lyin’ in my bed that night
You were acting like a different person
As if suddenly you wanted to just be friends
I was hurt and so I took a shower
So you couldn't hear me, knowing I had to cry
Sad to know that while my heart was breaking
You were sleeping or just faking

[Chorus]
It’s leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only, ever since we fell in love4Embed Touch Cry Cigarettes After Sex ambient
