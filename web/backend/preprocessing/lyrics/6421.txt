It's hard havin' a heart in the city
Look at the stars, waitin' for someone
To tell you you're pretty, you're enough
So it goes, I don't know what the feeling's like
To be comfortable with a stranger in your skin
Don't know why you let them in

[Chorus]
We used to talk about the fakers in L.A
But now you're one of 'em and, damn, it hurts to say
I should've seen it comin' from a mile away, a mile away
You always wanted to take before you give, but what's the fun of it?
I don't know how you live with yourself in your Hollywood house in the hills
Gives me chills, city of angels

[Verse 2]
Used to say, if you ever made it, I'd be the first call
And life would stay fairly the same
Oh, our friendship wouldn't change at all
But you busted, haven't talked in a year
I mistrusted, now it's all comin' clear that you only think of yourself
May be loved but you're lonely as hell, oh

[Chorus]
We used to talk about the fakers in L.A
But now you're one of 'em, I guess you got your way
I bet you're tired of all the games you had to play, you had to play
You always wanted to take before you give, but what's the fun of it?
I don't know how you live with yourself in your Hollywood house in the hills
Gives me chills, city of angels
You might also like[Bridge]
That's what they call us, right?
Wish you were able
To see there's so much more to life
Than fortune and fame, validation and pain
When you always want more
There's nothing to gain

[Chorus]
We used to talk about the fakers in L.A
But now you're one of 'em and damn it hurts to say
Damn it hurts to say
You always wanted to take before you give, but what's the fun of it?
I don't know how you live with yourself in your Hollywood house in the hills
Gives me chills, city of angels

[Outro]
That's what they call us, right?
Wish you were able
To see there's so much more to life
City of angels
That's what they call us, right?
