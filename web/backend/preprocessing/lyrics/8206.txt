5 ContributorsWithout You Lyrics[Intro: Gospel Choir Vocals]
(1, 2, 3, go)
Woah
I'm never going without you, no
I'm never going without you

[Verse 1: Will Anderson]
I try to fight it
But every time it's like a brand new car
Or a drug and you know you're gonna try it
When they tell you that you can't do that
But you will and you know you're gonna like it

[Pre-Chorus: Will Anderson]
When you light a flame it grows
If you set a bomb it's gonna blow
When I see your pretty little face that I want to know that

[Chorus: Will Anderson]
I don't want to fall asleep without you
(I don't want to fall asleep without you)
I don't want to take one breath without you
(I don't want to take one breath without you)
I don't even know one thing about you
But give me everything about you
It's only been a moment, it's true
But I could never live this life without you

Woah
I'm never going without you, no
I'm never going without you

[Verse 2: Will Anderson]
You give me one look
And I'll be on one knee with the plastic ring
God, and I don't even know you
Yeah, we could run this back one million times
But it's no use
I'll keep falling too fast
Why do I only want what I don't have?

[Chorus: Will Anderson, Gospel Choir Vocals]
Like
I don't want to fall asleep without you
(Never without you)
I don't want to take one breath without you
(Never without you)
I don't even know one thing about you
But give me everything about you
It's only been a moment, it's true
But I could never live this life without you
I could never live without you
[Bridge: Will Anderson, Gospel Choir Vocals]
It doesn't matter where I go
Doesn't matter if I run
We were always gonna get too close
We were always gonna fall in love
It doesn't matter where I go
Doesn't matter if I run
We were always gonna get too close
We were always gonna fall in love

I don't want to fall asleep without you
I don't want to take one breath without you
Oh and I don't even know one thing about you
But give me everything about you

[Chorus: Will Anderson]
I know that I don't want to fall asleep without you
(Never without you)
I don't want to take one breath without you
(Never without you)
I don't even know one thing about you
But give me everything about you
It's only been a moment, it's true
(Only been a moment, it's true)
But I could never live this life without you
I could never live without you
[Gospel Choir Vocals, Will Anderson]
Doesn't matter where I go
Doesn't matter if I run
If I run
We were always gonna get too close
We were always gonna fall in love

[Chorus: Will Anderson]
I don't even know one thing about you
But give me everything about you
It's only been a moment, it's true, yeah
But I could never live this life without you

[Gospel Choir Vocals]
Never without you
