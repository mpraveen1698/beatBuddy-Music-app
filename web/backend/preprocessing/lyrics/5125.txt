Every bond you break, every step you take, I'll be watching you
Every single day and every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay, I'll be watching you

Every move you make, and every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake, I'll be watching you

Every breath you take and every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take, I'll be watching you
Every single day and every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay, I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you
Every breath you take and every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take (I'll be watching you)
Every single day, every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay (I'll be watching you)

Every breath you take and every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take (I'll be watching you)
Every single day, every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay (I'll be watching you)You might also likeEmbed Every Breath You Take Every Breath You Take Deep Chills french
