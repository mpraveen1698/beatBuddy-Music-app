6 ContributorsGradually Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sit down
Let's talk it out a third time this week
Don't you quit now
We can make it but it's hard to believe 'cause I

[Pre-Chorus]
I was terrified you was seeing someone new
Getting left behind seemed to change my point view
Set it all aside, maybe we could just redo
Tell me what I'm going through
I just need you to

[Chorus]
Get back to me, so sad for me
All the work we put in just to pack and leave
Know time will tell
You were bad for me
If you feel like letting go, go gradually
If you feel like letting go
If you feel like letting go
If you feel like letting go
Oh oh, go gradually

[Verse 2]
Sit down
Gotta talk you down a third time this week
I'll admit it now
Couldn't make it wasn't hard to believe 'cause I

I was terrified you was seeing someone new
Getting left behind seemed to change my point view
Set it all aside, maybe we could just redo
Tell me what I'm going through
I just need you to

[Chorus]
Get back to me
So sad for me
All the work we put in, just to pack and leave
Know time will tell
You were bad for me
If you feel like letting go, go gradually
If you feel like letting go
If you feel like letting go
If you feel like letting go
Oh no
Go gradually

[Bridge]
Don't tell me I fell too hard
'Cause you left me
How do I restart?
Don't tell me I fell too hard
'Cause you left me
[Chorus]
Get back to me
So sad for me
All the work we put in, just to pack and leave
Know time will tell
You were bad for me
If you feel like letting go, go gradually
Get back to me
So sad for me
All the work we put in, just to pack and leave
Know time will tell
You were bad for me
If you feel like letting go, go graduallyEmbed Gradually Gradually ASTN chill
