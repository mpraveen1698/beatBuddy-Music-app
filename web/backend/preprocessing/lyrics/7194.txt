I am in love with you
You heard me?
I am in love with you
And I know that love is just a shout into the void
And that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed
And that one day, all of our labors will be returned to dust
And I know that the sun will swallow the only earth
We will ever have, and I am in love with you, sorry

[Instrumental]
