15 ContributorsThe Grey Lyrics[Verse 1]
Evened the scores, then I let it all go fall apart (Fall apart)
And every step forward put a little more sword in your heart, yeah
Looking sideways when I say I'm okay with the past (With the past)
But I'm afraid of what I might say if you ask

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave you way too many chances, you ran through 'em all
Got everything I could want, but it wasn't enough
Nobody left for me to talk to, nobody to call
Got everything I could want, but I still wanted more
Yeah, I still wanted more

[Chorus]
There's not another way, don't let me go
Don't dig another grave today
I'll make the same mistakes, I'll never know
Who I was before I faded away
Into the grey

[Verse 2]
All of this time sittin' inside, sittin' in the dark (In the dark)
And every night, I can see why you could never stop, yeah (Yeah)
Lying is hard and the truth comes out anyway (Anyway)
You're going way too far, gonna drop dead at this rate

Gave you way too many chances, you ran through 'em all
Got everything I could want, but it wasn't enough
Nobody left for me to talk to, nobody to call
Got everything I could want, but I still wanted more

[Chorus]
There's not another way, don't let me go
Don't dig another grave today
I'll make the same mistakes, I'll never know
Who I was before I faded away
Into the grey

[Post-Chorus]
I did it to myself, tried to be someone else
I let it tear me down and I'll never be the same
I did it to myself, tried to be someone else
And you didn't notice 'til I finally got, finally got away

[Bridge]
(There's not another way, don't let me go)
(Don't dig another grave today)
(Finally got away)
(I'll make the same mistakes, I'll never know)
(Who I was before I faded away)
[Chorus]
There's not another way, don't let me go
Don't dig another grave today
I'll make the same mistakes, I'll never know
Who I was before I faded away
Into the grey
