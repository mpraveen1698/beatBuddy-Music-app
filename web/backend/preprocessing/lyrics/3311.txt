Stuck in a daydream in Paradise
That summer feeling, oh-oh-oh
Don't need no reason, just livin' life
No time for sleepin'

[Refrain]
So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long
Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one
You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself
Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone
And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum
Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month
Should be sorry, but not sorry

[Chorus]
At least I had fun
Oh, at least I had fun
At least I had fun
At least I had fun
Oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Had good intentions, guess it went wrong (Ooh)
But I ain't trippin', no-oh

So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long
Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one
You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself
Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone
And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum
Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month
Should be sorry, but not sorry

[Chorus]
At least I had fun
Oh, at least I had fun
At least I had fun
At least I had fun

[Bridge]
I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone
And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum
Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month
Should be sorry, but not sorry

[Chorus]
At least I had fun
At least I had fun (Oh)
At least I had fun
At least I had fun
