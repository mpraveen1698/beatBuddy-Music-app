Are you the emperor?
Ah, alright
Are you the emperor?
Am I the emperor?
Hahahaha

[Verse 1]
The sun's gonna shine today, so don't worry
I know everything will be okay
Wipe off your face and stop running
Leave your mistakes to yesterday
I don't wanna waste my time 'cause it's money
I feel happy all so suddenly
Get out your head and get buzzin'
Today's gonna be the one for me

[Pre-Chorus]
All day, all day, all day, all day, all day, all day, all day, all day
Repeat, repeat, repeat
All day, all day, all day, all day, all day, all day, all day, all day
Repeat
