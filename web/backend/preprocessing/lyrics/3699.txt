19 ContributorsMore Hearts Than Mine Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't wait to show you where I grew up
Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now

[Verse 2]
We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church, because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off, but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before we hit the road

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin', but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Verse 3]
My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive
You might also like[Chorus]
So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner, but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Bridge]
Oh
Mmh

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'
He'll pour some whiskey over ice and
Tell a lie and say he never really liked you
Oh, if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
You'll be breaking more hearts than mine2Embed More Hearts Than Mine Lady Like Ingrid Andress country
