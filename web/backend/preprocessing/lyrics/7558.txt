18 Contributors​when we were young Lyrics[Intro]
Oh
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
We're separated by a margin of a greater degree
The same flesh and blood but in a different lane
I read the remedy too but my words, they still sounded the same

[Chorus]
When we were young
We thought we had the whole world figured out (Figured out)
Now all we do is speak in tongues
We play a losing game
Only now we hear the shouts fading out
We flew into thе sun


[Post-Chorus]
We flew into the sun
Oh

[Verse 2]
I'm dеdicated to the shadow that's been following me
It caught me counting the cards, I guess the rules remain
Oh, it was heavenly then but the devils were calling my name

When we were young
We thought we had the whole world figured out (Figured out)
Now all we do is speak in tongues
We play a losing game
Only now we hear the shouts fading out
We flew into the sun

[Bridge]
Is there something in your eye?
Did you fall or were you just on a high?
Everybody's so afraid they could die
But they never once said
"Thank God we're alive", oh
Is there something in your eye?
Did you fall or were you just on a high?
Everybody's so afraid they could die
But they never once said
"Thank God we're alive", oh

[Chorus]
When we were young
We thought we had the whole world figured out (Figured out)
We flew into the sun
We thought we had the whole world figured out (Figured out)
Now all we do is speak in tongues
We play a losing game
Only now we hear the shouts fading out
