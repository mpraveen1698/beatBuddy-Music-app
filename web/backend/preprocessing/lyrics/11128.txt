1 ContributorBring It On Home To Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Paul Carrack]
Said if you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
(Bring it on home to me)

[Verse 2: Paul Carrack]
You know I tried to treat you right
Oh, but, you stayed out, stayed out late at night
Oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
(Bring it on home to me) Yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Paul Carrack]
Said if you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
