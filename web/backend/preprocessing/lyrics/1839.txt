I wanna rock! (Rock!)
I wanna rock! (Rock!)
I want to rock (Rock!)
I wanna rock! (Rock!)

[Verse 1]
"Turn it down," you say?
But all I got to say to you is
Time and time again I say, "No!" (No!)
No, no, no, no, no!
Tell me not to play
Well, all I got to say to you
When you tell me not to play, I say, "No!" (No!)
No, no, no, no, no!

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So, if you ask me why I like the way I play it
There's only one thing I can say to you

[Chorus]
I wanna rock! (Rock!)
I wanna rock! (Rock!)
I want to rock (Rock!)
I wanna rock! (Rock!)

Nothin' in the world that makes me go! (Go!)

Hear my favorite song so, let's go! (Go!)
Go, go, go, go, go!

When it's like this I feel the music shootin' through me
There's nothin' else that I would rather do

I want to rock (Rock!)
I wanna rock! (Rock!)
