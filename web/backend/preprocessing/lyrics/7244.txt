As you walk through the shadow
Feel your weight on solid ground
As you tremble in the darkness
In the midst of silent sounds
As you search for your answer
And no answer has been found
May you stand, stand your ground

[Verse 2]
And when you come to the table
To lay your burdens down
As you wait upon the weary
For whom no rest was found
As you search for to lean on
And find no friend around
May you stand, stand your ground

[Chorus]
And may you stand, stand your ground
May you stand, stand your ground
When the last step is before you
And you feel like falling down
May you stand, stand your ground

[Verse 3]
And as you kneel in the garden
And no one is around
As you raise your hands above you
And from your lips cry out
Oh Father forgive me
For I could not see through my doubt
May you stand, stand your ground
You might also like[Chorus]
And may you stand, stand your ground
May you stand, stand your ground
When the last step is before you
And your light is burning out
May you stand, stand your ground
Oh, may you stand, stand your ground yeah
May you stand, stand your groundEmbed Stand Your Ground Echos Joshua Hyslop acoustic
