6 ContributorsWhy Canâ€™t I Have You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I can't see your face now
If I let you go, will you come back another time?
So I can look forward
Oh we're never done, are we babe?
So, you say that I'm never fooled by
The depth of your eyes, I don't agree but I see
I'm not what you want babe

[Chorus]
Well we waste our time on things we want
Why can't I have you baby?
Why can't I get you baby?
Waste our love on things that will never give it back
Why can't I have you baby?
Why can't I get you baby?

[Verse 2]
So you need help? Well, I've got you covered
I'm here when you need a sunny day
Something good, 'cause I never had that
Don't bend your rules if you don't want to
But I think you do
So I sit back and let things go how you play them

[Chorus]
Well we waste our time on things we want
Why can't I have you baby?
Why can't I get you baby?
Waste our love on things that won't ever give it back
Why can't I have you baby? (Oh)
Why can't I get you baby? (Oh)
