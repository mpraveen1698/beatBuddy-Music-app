53 ContributorsAwake and Alive Lyrics[Verse 1: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
I'm at war with the world and they
Try to pull me into the dark
I struggle to find my faith
As I'm slippin' from your arms
It's getting harder to stay awake
And my strength is fading fast
You breathe into me at last

[Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
I'm awake, I'm alive
Now I know what I believe inside
Now it's my time
I'll do what I want, 'cause this is my life!
Here (Right here!), right now (Right now!)
Stand my ground and never back down!
I know what I believe inside
I'm awake and I'm alive

[Verse 2: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
I'm at war with the world 'cause I
Ain't never gonna sell my soul
I've already made up my mind
No matter what, I can't be bought or sold
When my faith is getting weak
And I feel like giving in
You breathe into me again

In the dark
I can feel you in my sleep
In your arms, I feel you breathe into me
Forever hold this heart that I will give to you
Forever, I will live for you!
