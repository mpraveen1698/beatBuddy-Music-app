Me on the roof
Yeah, I'm up for everything you say (Aye)
I'm into you
We just can't deny this chemistry

When you're with me
Be honest
Let's just be honest
You got me in my feelings
Yeah, yeah

Never understood what it feels like
Like the way that you're turning me 'round
If you ever feel down and out
Let me know, let me know, yeah, yeah
Don't be sleepin' on you, there's nothing better
Don't be sleepin' on your lovе, nothing's better
Yeah, yеah
