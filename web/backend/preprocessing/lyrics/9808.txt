5 ContributorsBetter With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Last night I was messed up, but I hope you will forget
Please do me a favor, erase the things I said
Pull me a little closer, take away the pain
Remind me I got everything to lose
I'm better with you
I’m better with you

[Chorus]
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I’m better with you
I'm better with you

[Verse 2]
Laying by your bedside, you feel so far away
Guess my quota's full now; go ahead, make a mistake
You'll say that you're sorry, and I'll say it's ok
'Cause I know I got everything to lose
I’m better with you
I’m better with you
You'll say that you’re sorry, and I'll say it's ok
'Cause I know I got everything to lose

[Chorus]
I’m better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
You might also like[Bridge]
I am by your side, nothing else will matter
When your eyes meet mine, we say it all in silence
Under the same sky, good things fall together
Now I know I'm better with you

[Chorus]
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with youEmbed Better With You Better With You 3LAU;Justin Caruso;Iselin electronic
