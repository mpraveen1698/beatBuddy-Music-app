And the truth sat on the water with the ashes and the smoke
Before that day no one believed that the spirit flies into the trees
But I saw it go and I saw it catch in William's Tree

Yeah, I saw it go and I saw it catch in William's Tree

Winter's water fell around, William's leaves were on the ground
But in 3 days time, there were thousands more somehow
Before that time when sadness fell, folks were wishin' on the well
Now they came and sat beneath to hear what William's leaves would tell

Now they came and sat beneath to hear what William's leaves would tell

And I hope you find your way to home
We'll miss you when you go
I hope you find your way to home
Here's something you should know
I hope you find your way to home
We'll miss you when you go
I hope you find your way to home
We'll miss you when you go

Many sat beneath the branches
Dreaming thunder rain and dances
Many sat beneath the branches
Dreaming thunder rain and dances
And the tree would rustle and shake and sway
You might also likeAnd the tree would rustle and shake and sway

And I hope you find your way to home
We'll miss you when you go
I hope you find your way to home
Here's something you should know
I hope you find your way to home
We'll miss you when you go
I hope you find your way to home
We'll miss you when you go

[Interlude]

The longest night of a hundred years
I sat with the tree in the cold night air
And I saw it go and slowly disappear
The time of the night was deep in dreams
But I was sure what I had seen
There is here and gone and the soul
No longer walked in between

There is here and gone and the soul
No longer walked in between

Well, I hope you find your way to home
We'll miss you when you go
I hope you find your way to home
Here's something you should know
I hope you find your way to home
We'll miss you when you go
I hope you find your way to home
We'll miss you when you goEmbed Dreaming Dreaming Thunder french
