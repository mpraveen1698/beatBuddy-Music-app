2 ContributorsSomething Left Here LyricsTeardrops I cried for you and me, the memories and pain are the only things we have here
Secret sins, like footprints on the shore, I wish they’ll be withered away by the evening's gentle breeze

I had a dream that I had the wings to fly, falling through depths of sky till I fade away
No pain, no more nights I wake to nightmares
And you’re not there with me in the sky
That’s how I realized I would lose you that way

Fading like stars, blooming like flowers, we shed tears so beautiful
Two broken hearts, two broken dreams, we'll leave them behind into the night

Teardrops you cried for you and me, I need to open my eyes just to see them as you go
Light of dusk, I pray it will lead the way of the only one I loved, as it melts into the horizon
And the dark blue curtains hide the sky
Killer winds and burning clouds have gone away
If I could turn back time to when we were a pair of little birds
If only I could learn how to stay by your side

Dear fading stars, dear loving world, we shed the tears once so fleetingly
Dear blooming flowers, dear only one, I pray that your life will be beautiful

Fading like stars, blooming like flowers, we had a dream secretly in vain
Two broken hearts, two broken worlds, we'll leave them behind into the nightYou might also likeEmbed If Only I Could Fly Ever So Slightly Dream Flows sleep
