(Do-, do-, do-, do-, don't, don't)

[Verse 1]
I've been feelin' all the pressure
I'd been lookin' for a sign, mmm
I don't love you any lesser
I just need a little time

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry but for real
Don't wanna be tied up
Don't wanna feel too much
There's things I wanna do, oh no don't

[Chorus]

(Don't you hold me down)
(Do-, do-, do-, do-, don't, don't)
