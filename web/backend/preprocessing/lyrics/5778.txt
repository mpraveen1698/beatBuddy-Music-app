So don't let go of me of my memory
We had everything
Oh, I promise you I will do better
And that forever, I'll keep you safe in these days
So don't let go of me of my memory
We had everything
Oh, I promise you I will do better
And that forever, I'll keep you safe in these days

Ooh, oh

If I like I lost my settle light
Losing pieces of us every night
Took me for too long to turn around
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I apologisе that I, kept you waiting
I lost my mind at sweet elevation
Now I just wanna hold on to what's lеft of us
You might also like[Chorus]
So don't let go of me of my memory
We had everything
Oh, I promise you I will do better
And that forever, I'll keep you safe in these days

Ooh, oh, I'll keep you safe in these days
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh, I'll keep you safe in these days
I'll keep you safe in these days

[Pre-Drop]
I'll keep you safe in these days
