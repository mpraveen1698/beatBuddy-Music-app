9 ContributorsOut The Grave Lyrics[Intro]
Oh-oh-ohhh
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'ma get a bag, and some brand new racks
I don't get attached, no, my soul is all black
Everybody talks, I don't ever talk back
Watch 'em all run, 'cause I'm finally out the grave
Brand new pain, probably go insane
'Til the end of my days, I'm a young Cobain
I never could escape it
I see the game, yeah, it's mine for the taking
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Everybody's so brainwashed, stuck up in the matrix
I don't wanna face this life no more
Everybody's so soulless, ain't living for the moment
You're just doing what you're told
Don't want a check, I'ma do this 'til the coffin
Got 'em mad, yeah, I know they're all watching
'Cause they've been lying if they said they didn't want this
I was off-track, bounced back, now I'm all in

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't save me, I won't crash and burn
'Cause my luck finally starts to turn
I take this world, set it all on fire
The day I see the reaper, that's the day I retire
You might also like[Chorus]
I'ma get a bag, and some brand new racks
I don't get attached, no my soul is all black
Everybody talks, I don't ever talk back
Watch 'em all run, 'cause I'm finally out the grave
Brand new pain, probably go insane
'Til the end of my days, I'm a young Cobain
I never could escape it
I see the game, yeah, it's mine for the taking
(Oh-oh-ohhh)

[Verse 2]
I see the world falling apart, I can't change that
Everyone just lives in the dark, they can't take that
'Cause pharma got rich, and politicians all lie
They're all bought and sold, and we pretend it's fine
I don't regret what I said, got no love in my veins
And I won't run from my death, I just want the sweet embrace

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't save me, I won't crash and burn
'Cause my luck finally starts to turn
I take this world, set it all on fire
The day I see the reaper, that's the day I retire

[Chorus]
I'ma get a bag, and some brand new racks
I don't get attached, no my soul is all black
Everybody talks, I don't ever talk back
Watch 'em all run, 'cause I'm finally out the grave
Brand new pain, probably go insane
'Til the end of my days, I'm a young Cobain
I never could escape it
I see the game, yeah, it's mine for the taking
