I think that possibly, maybe I'm falling for you
Yes, there's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over you
I've seen the paths that your eyes wander down, I want to come too
I think that possibly, maybe I'm falling for you

[Pre-Chorus]
No one understands me quite like you do
Through all of the shadowy corners of me
[Chorus]
I never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop I love so much
All of the while I never knew
I never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop I love so much
All of the while I never knew

[Verse 2]
I think that possibly, maybe I'm falling for you
Yes, there's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over you
I've seen the waters that make your eyes shine, now I'm shining too
Because, oh because I've fallen quite hard over you

[Pre-Chorus]
If I didn't know you, I'd rather not know
If I couldn't have you, I'd rather be alone
You might also like[Chorus]
I never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop I love so much
All of the while I never knew
I never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop I love so much
All of the while I never knew
All of the while, all of the while
It was you

[Outro]
You
You
