Feel it heavy in my bones now
Feel like everybody goes out
And smiles for the 'gram
Yeah, tried but I can't
Prayer in the shape of Prozac
Try to medicate the lows that
Come and meet me in the night time
Losing track of my time

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said gonna be all right
But mama don't know what it's like in my mind
Mama said that the sun gonna shine
But mama don't know what it's like to want to die

[Chorus]
I can't carry this anymore
Heavy from the hurt inside my veins
I can't carry this anymore
Wonder what it's like to be okay

[Verse 2]
Would you like me if I drank that?
If you wanted I could take that
I'll do anything for love
I don't feel like I'm enough
You can probably see right through me
'Cause I can promise if you knew me
You would probably walk away
No you wouldn't want to stay

Oh, mama said gonna be all right
But mama don't know what it's like in my mind
Mama said that the sun gon' shine
But mama don't know what it's like to want to die

[Chorus]
I can't carry this anymore
Heavy from the hurt inside my veins
I can't carry this anymore
Wonder what it's like to be okay

[Bridge]
I know I'll be fine it's just that
Every time this comes back
Tell my maker up above that
I have had enough and

[Chorus]
I can't carry this anymore
Heavy from the hurt inside my veins
I can't carry this anymore
Wonder what it's like to be okay16Embed I Can't Carry This Anymore I Can't Carry This Anymore Anson Seabra songwriter
