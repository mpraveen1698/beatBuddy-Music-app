(A aaa aaa, a aaa aaa, a a aa aaa a aa a aaa)
This night ain't for the faint of heart
For the faint of heart, for the faint of heart
This night ain't for the faint of heart
'Cause the faint of heart gon' fall apart

[Verse 2]
(A aaa aaa, a aaa aaa, a a aa aaa a aa a aaa)
This night ain't for the holy man with the holy plan
For the promise land
This night we got the evil hand
And the evil hand gon' raise the damned

[Chorus]
(A aaa aaa, a aaa aaa, a a aa aaa a aa a aaa)
Ain't no sleep when the wicked play
All we do is yodel, ay ayy hoo y hoo
Ain't no love when the wicked run
All we do is
Yodel ah a ay ya ay ya
We the wicked ones, the wicked ones
(A aaa aaa, a aaa aaa, a a aa aaa a aa a aaa)

[Verse 3]
This night ain't for the faint of heart
For the faint of heart, for the faint of heart
This night ain't for the faint of heart
'Cause when the train wreck comes gon' leave a mark

Ain't no sleep when the wicked play
All we do is yodel, ay ayy hoo y hoo
Ain't no love when the wicked run
All we do is
Yodel ah a ay ya ay ya

(A aaa aaa, a aaa aaa, a a aa aaa a aa a aaa)
(A aaa aaa, a aaa aaa, a a aa aaa a aa a aaa)

Ain't no love when the wicked run
All we do is
