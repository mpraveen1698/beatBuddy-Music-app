When we're out there dancin' on the floor, darlin'
And I feel like I need some more
And I feel your body close to mine
And I know my love, it's about that time
Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real

[Chorus]
You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real

[Verse 2]
When we get home, darlin'
And it's nice and dark
And the music's in me
And I'm still real hot
Then you kiss me there
And it feels real good
And I know you'll love me
Like you should

[Chorus]
Oh, you make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real

I feel real, I feel real
I feel real, I feel real
Real real, I feel real
I feel real, I feel real, woo

[Bridge]
I feel real, I feel real
I feel real, real real
Woo, I feel real
Woo, I feel real
I feel real, real real
I feel real, I'm real real

[Chorus]
You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real
Oh, you make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real

[Outro]
Oh, I feel real when you touch me
I feel real when you kiss me
I feel real when you touch me
I feel real when you hold me3Embed You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real) Step II Sylvester disco
