I think you've done enough

[Verse 1]
If I could become someone that I could fall in love with
It'd probably be easier to find you
Probably be easier to find you
If I could become someone that I could fall in love with
Discuss with and learn from
Probably be easier to find you

[Chorus]
It feels like there's hands around my neck
You've got a lot of nerve comin' 'round here
Without a reason to love me
In all that you've done with all that you've done
I think you've done enough
Hands around my neck
You've got a lot of nerve comin' 'round here
Without a reason to love me
In all that you've done with all that you've done
I think you've done enough

[Drop]
Hands around my neck
You've got a lot of nerve comin' 'round here
Without a reason to love me
In all that you've done with all that you've done
I think you've done enough
With all that you've—
A-All that you've done
With all that you've—
A-All that you've done
With all that you've—
A-All that you've done

I know what it's like to be hopeless
Know what it feels to be broken
Know it's a slow process
It takes time to love yourself
And get to know somebody
The longer you wait, the better it makes it
The longer you wait

[Chorus]
It feels like there's hands around my neck
You've got a lot of nerve comin' 'round here
Without a reason to love me
In all that you've done with all that you've done
I think you've done enough

[Drop]
Hands around my neck
You've got a lot of nerve comin' 'round here
Without a reason to love me
In all that you've done with all that you've done
I think you've done enough
With all that you've done
With all that you've done
With all that you've done
With all that you've done
With all that you've done
With all that you've done
With all that you've—
With all that you've done
[Outro]
Hands around my neck
You've got a lot of nerve comin' 'round here
Without a reason to love me
In all that you've done with all that you've done
I think you've done enough2Embed You've Done Enough Olympia Gorgon City;DRAMA groove
