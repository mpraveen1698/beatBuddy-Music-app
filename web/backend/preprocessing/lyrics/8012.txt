Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Let me say that since, baby
Since we've been together
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Oh, baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why, somebody, why people break-up
Oh, turn around and make-up
I just can't see
You'd never do that to me
Would you, baby?
Just being around you is all I see
You might also likeHere's what I want us to do

Let's, we ought to stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Come on

Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sadEmbed Let's Stay Together Let's Stay Together Keys & Copper;Shanna Michelle deep-house
