Uh-oh, uh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Anne-Marie, Perrie, All]
Don't wanna hear one more lie
They used to work, but not tonight
That's the last time you do me wrong (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Got my stuff, I'm out the door
Now I'm the one you're begging for
Don't know what you got until it's gone (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Pre-Chorus: All, Leigh-Anne]
(Uh-oh) Already know how this goes
(Uh-oh) Give you my all, then you ghost
(Uh-oh) But when I'm gone, you do the most (Uh-oh), yeah

[Chorus: Anne-Marie, All]
Why you only love me when I'm walkin' away?
Only ever want me when I don't wanna stay?
Love the feeling, hittin' different
I'm not ever looking back
While I'm leaving, see you staring
Go ahead, boy, you can kiss my

[Post-Chorus: All, Anne-Marie]
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
You can kiss my
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
You can kiss my

Boy, all you did was make me strong (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
