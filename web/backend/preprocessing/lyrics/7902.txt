9 ContributorsKEEP IT TO YOURSELF Lyrics[Verse 1]
You should probably keep it to yourself
I don't need to know about the way that you're running 'round
Getting down with somebody else
I know that I said I wish you well
But you don't need to throw it in my face that you're happy now
Happier with somebody else

[Pre-Chorus]
And something tells me you've been gettin' over me
And movin' on with somebody
And I know how you like to kiss and tell

[Chorus]
But you should probably keep it to yourself
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh
You should probably keep it to yourself
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh
You should probably keep it to yourself

[Verse 2]
You should probably keep it on the low
I don't need to see that you're hangin' out late at night
Places that you and me go
And usually I'm not a jealous show
But lately I've been spinnin' out
Thinkin' 'bout how you ain't thinkin' about me at all
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And something tells me you've been gettin' over mе
And movin' on with somebody
And I know how you like to kiss and tell

[Chorus]
But you should probably keep it to yoursеlf
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh
You should probably keep it to yourself
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh
You should probably keep it to yourself

[Bridge]
And even after all that you've been through
You cross your heart, but you found someone new
Somehow you found a way to hurt me even if you're not around

[Pre-Chorus]
And something tells me you've been gettin' over me
And movin' on with somebody
And I know how you like to kiss and tell

[Chorus]
But you should probably keep it to yourself, yeah, yeah
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh
You should probably keep it to yourself, oh, oh
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh
You should probably keep it to yourself1Embed KEEP IT TO YOURSELF MAYBE SOMEDAY IT'LL ALL BE OK Clinton Kane singer-songwriter
