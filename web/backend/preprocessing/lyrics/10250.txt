2 ContributorsValerie (Glee Cast Concert Version) LyricsSantana
Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over? Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie

Did you have to go to jail, put your house all up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan, I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
And are you shoppin' anywhere, changed the colour of you hair, and are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine that you were dodgin' all the time, are you still dizzy?

'Cause since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over? Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie

Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head I paint a picture
You might also like'Cause since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over? Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie
Valerie, hey
Valerie, Valerie
Valerie, why don't you come on over, Valerie?Embed Valerie - Glee Cast Version Glee: The Music, Volume 4 Glee Cast club
