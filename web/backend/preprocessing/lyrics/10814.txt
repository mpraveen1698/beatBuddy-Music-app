15 ContributorsAkudama Lyrics[Intro]
Watch the bodies drop

[Chorus]
Cut it off, off with the head
Cut it off, from the fucking neck
Cut it off, better off dead
Cut it off

[Verse 1]
Say it to my face, better dig two graves
I thought I told you motherfuckers I don't play safe
Oh, like a bitter pill
It leaves a bad taste when you bite
The hand that feeds
I'll see you starve (See you starve)
Because without me
You fall apart

[Hook]
Sick to death of holding my breath
Before I suffocate
Say my fucking name

Hold your grudge, never a candle
Can't throw shade when you live in my shadow
Who the fuck, do you think you are?
Cut the head off, watch the bodies drop

[Chorus]
Cut it off, off with the head
Cut it off, from the fucking neck
Cut it off, better off dead
Cut it off

[Hook]
Sick to death of holding my breath
Before I suffocate
Say my fucking name

[Outro]
So fucking sick to death of (Sick to death)
Having to bite my tongue off (Of holding my breath)
Another coarse reminder (Sick to death)
That if I'm going nowhere (Of holding my breath)
I will see you there1Embed Akudama A Quiet Place to Die Alpha Wolf hardcore
