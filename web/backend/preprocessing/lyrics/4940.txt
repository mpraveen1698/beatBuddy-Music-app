Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Who breaks the power, of sin and darkness?
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
The King of Glory
The King above all kings
(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
And leaves us breathless, in awe and wonder?
The King of Glory
The King above all kings

[Chorus]
This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross
You laid down Your life
That I would be set free
Oh, Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done for me

Who brings our chaos back into order?
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?
The King of Glory
The King of Glory

Who rules the nations with truth and justice?
Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
The King of Glory
The King above all kings

[Chorus]
Yeah, this is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross
You laid down Your life
That I would be set free
Oh, Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done for me

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain (Slain)
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave (Conquered the grave)
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain (The Lamb who was slain)
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy, Worthy, Worthy

Oh, this is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
