17 ContributorsThe Trip Lyrics[Verse 1]
Time has come to go
Pack your bags, hit the open road
Our hearts just won't die
It's the trip keeps us alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
So many miles
So many miles
So many miles
Away

[Verse 2]
The falling sun burns a line
Tearing into the night
Watching you fall asleep
The sweetest dove in a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
