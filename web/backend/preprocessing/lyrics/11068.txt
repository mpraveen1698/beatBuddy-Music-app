You deserve someone who listens to you
Hears every word and knows what to do
When you're feeling hopeless lost and confused

[Verse 2]
You need a man who holds you for hours
Make your friends jealous when he brings you flowers
And laughs when he says they don't have love like ours

[Chorus]
There's somebody out there who's looking for you
Someday he'll find you, I swear that it's true
He's gonna kiss you and you'll feel the world standstill
There's somebody out there who will

[Verse 3]
He'll take you dancing and pull you in close
Spin you around and won't let you go
'Til they turn the lights off and he'll take you home
There's somebody out there who will

[Chorus]
There's somebody out there who's looking for you
Someday he'll find you I swear that it's true
He's gonna kiss you and you'll feel the world standstill
There's somebody out there who will

Someday he'll find you I swear that it's true
And he's gonna kiss you and you'll feel the world standstill, oh
You need some who'll miss you
Hold you and kiss you
