4 ContributorsWeekend Vibe Lyrics[Verse 1]
I move my feet to reach that sun
Where our emotions blur into shapes and forms
On Ocean Drive, Miami Beach
We call it paradise, so the only place that we need

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Skip the Monday and Tuesday, right
I wanna stay in that weekend vibe
Oh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, lose your body and feel alright
'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Keep us dancin' or groovin'
I wanna stay in that weekend vibe
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Lose your body and feel alright
'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes

[Verse 2]
Let's wrap it up, accelerate
'Cause workin' nine-to-five, it won't makе us celebrate
A bеatin' drum under the sun
Let's catch a wave and take a trip to higher grounds

When darkness come, you make it shine
