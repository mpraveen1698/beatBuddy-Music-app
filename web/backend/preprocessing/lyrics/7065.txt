8 ContributorsEsther Lyrics[Verse 1: BAYNK]
Oh, I've been waiting for you to show tonight too long
Only be coming back when they're turning the lights all off
Tell me you've seen me around, steam on the ground
Think I'm lost, oh
I'm lost

[Pre-Chorus: BAYNK]
'Cause you don't come less the sun's not up
But I'm lucid for your love

[Chorus]
Hey, Esther
Won't you come around, figure out what your body likes?
Hey, Esther
'Cause I'm down, when you're down, middle of the night
Hey, Esther
Won't you come around, figure out what your body likes?
Hey, Esther
I could lay you down 'til the sun's coming through the blinds
Hey, Esther

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Oh, I can see it now, picture it, playing out in slow-mo (Yeah, yeah)
Got my body, sweating, glistening, lights so low
Feeling your hands on my waist, we're face to face, don't let go
Don't let go
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe & Both]
But I won't come unless the sun's not up
But I'm lucid for your love
'Cause you don't come 'less the sun's not up
But I'm lucid for your love

[Chorus: Tinashe & BAYNK]
Hey, Esther
Won't you come around, figure out what my body likes?
Hey, Esther
'Cause I'm down, when you're down, middle of the night
Hey, Esther
Won't you come around, figure out what my body likes?
Hey, Esther
You could lay me down 'til the sun's coming through the blinds

[Hook: Tinashe & BAYNK, BAYNK]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Slippin' through you teeth like smo-o-o-o-o-oke
I don't even know what's real
I don't even know if you're here right now
I just know the way you feel, my mouth
Oh myâ€”

[Chorus: BAYNK & Tinashe]
Hey, Esther
Won't you come around, figure out what your body likes?
Hey, Esther
'Cause I'm down, when you're down, middle of the night
Hey, Esther
Won't you come around, figure out what your body likes?
Hey, Esther
I could lay you down 'til the sun's coming through the blinds
[Outro: BAYNK & Tinashe]
Hey, Esther
Hey, Esther
(Tell me what I like)
Hey, Esther
Hey, Esther
(I'm down)
Hey, Esther2Embed Esther ADOLESCENCE BAYNK;Tinashe soul
