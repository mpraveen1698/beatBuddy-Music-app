Do you cross your heart when you hope to die?
Are you sleeping deep in the hurricane?
IVs in the arm, forgetting to feel

[Refrain: Sam Carter, Sam Carter & Josh Middleton]
We're crawling on all fours
Will you fall on that sword at the second coming?
You're gonna taste the ash and dust
'Cause this world is dying in our arms

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Carter]
(Now the wheels are turnin')
(What would you do to stay alive if the planet was burnin'?)

[Chorus: Sam Carter]
You wanna make your Hell a reality?
Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe
(If they dare to breathe, woah-oh)
Sure sounds like Heaven to me
You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds
No place to go if we don't believe
(If we don't believe, woah-oh)
Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint

[Verse 2: Sam Carter]
Give us a Judas steer we can deify
Yeah, we all pretend we're the renegades
So wash us away, garrotted by a halo

Take a bow 'cause time's running out
There's no doubt that the end is coming
You're gonna taste the ash
You're gonna taste the dust
'Cause this world is dying in our arms

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Carter]
(Now the wheels are turnin')
(What would you do to stay alive if the planet was burning?)

[Chorus: Sam Carter]
You wanna make your Hell a reality?
Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe
(If they dare to breathe, woah-oh)
Sure sounds like Heaven to me
You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds
No place to go if we don't believe
(If we don't believe, woah-oh)
Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint

[Post-Chorus: Sam Carter]
(Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint)

[Breakdown: Sam Carter, Sam Carter & Josh Middleton]
Post-love, post-truth
Justice lays bound and black-bagged, ready for the guillotine
We can all plead guilty when they ask
"Where were you when the gods clipped the wings off the phoenix?"
They clipped the wings off the phoenix, ah
When will we wrestle the world from the fools and their gold
And the fucking covenant? (We'll be waiting)
Will enough be enough when we're holding on for dear life?
[Chorus: Sam Carter]
You wanna make your Hell a reality?
Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe
(If they dare to breathe, woah-oh)
Sure sounds like Heaven to me
You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds
No place to go if we don't believe
(If we don't believe, woah-oh)
Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint

[Post-Chorus: Sam Carter]
It's enough to plague a saint
It's enough to plague a saint
It's enough to plague a saint

[Outro: Sam Carter]
Ugh
We can all plead guilty when they ask
"Where were you when the gods clipped the wings off the phoenix?"5Embed Black Lungs For Those That Wish To Exist Architects metalcore
