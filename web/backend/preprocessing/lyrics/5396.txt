1 ContributorAll Night Lyrics[Chorus]
Been waiting for you all night, duh-duh-duh-duh
Been tryna get that feel right, duh-duh-duh-duh
Your body looking so nice, duh-duh-duh-duh
Been waiting for you all of the time

[Verse 1]
I've got some issues
Still I wanna kiss you
Why can't you just make up your mind?
Just tell me why
You brought your perfumes
That smell like your room
Are you down to kick it tonight?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't tell me that oh-oh
I'm thinking tonight I'll go
'Cause this love isn't whole
But baby, all know is I've

Been waiting for you all night, duh-duh-duh-duh
Been tryna get that feel right, duh-duh-duh-duh
Your body looking so nice, duh-duh-duh-duh

Been waiting for you all night, duh-duh-duh-duh
