Me born and raise in the New York City
In the dance hall, on the dance hall, on the dance floor
We do the ragga dance mana
Ragga man, yes, it is a ragga man jam
People drinking champagne fun full of fashion
Pump it up start to swing your body
While you listen to the music jump up and party

Ragga this, ragga that and a rabba-dub style
Feeling OK, me feeling so irie
