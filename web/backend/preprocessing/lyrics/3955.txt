Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Have I done my best here, or
Will I be here next year, or
Are these my best years yet?
Was looking forward to
Being important, but
I'm not important yet

[Chorus: Jack Met]
If you put this scene on a movie screen
Is it called a happy end?
If the work gets me where I'm supposed to be
Will I know I've made it then?
It's so hard
Can we skip to the good part?

[Post-Chorus: Jack Met]
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four

If there's a good part, then
I hope it's not far 'cause
I thought it'd be today
I napped on campus and
I smoked at dances, but
It didn't feel so great

[Chorus: Jack Met]
If you put this scene on a movie screen
Is it called a happy end?
If the work gets me where I'm supposed to be
Will I know I've made it then?
It's so hard
So can we skip to the good part?

[Post-Chorus: Jack Met]
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One, two, three, four (So can we skip to the good part?)
Ah, ah-ah-ah (To the good part, to the good part)
One, two, three, four
Ah, ah-ah-ah (Woo, woo)
One, two, three, four
[Outro: Jack Met]
(Ah, ah-ah-ah)
(Ah, ah-ah-ah)
These things take time
Mom and Dad, they have a good life
But what am I gonna do with mine?
(Ah, ah-ah-ah)
These things take time
Mom and Dad, they have a good life
But what the hell am I gonna do with mine?6Embed The Good Part The Click AJR rock
