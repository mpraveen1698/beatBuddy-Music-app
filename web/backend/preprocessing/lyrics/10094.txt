21 ContributorsFuck Her Gently Lyrics[Intro]
This is a song for the ladies
But fellasâ€¦listen closely

[Verse 1]
You don't always have to fuck her hard
In fact sometimes that's not right to do
Sometimes you've got to make some love
And fucking give her some smooches too
Sometimes you got to squeeze
Sometimes you got to say please
Sometime you got to say, hey

[Chorus]
I'm gonna fuck you softly
I'm 'onna screw you gently
I'm 'onna hump you sweetly
I'm 'onna ball you discreetly

[Bridge]
And then you say, "Hey I brought you flowers"
And then you say, "Wait a minute Sally
I think I got something in my teeth
Could you get it out for me?" That's fucking teamwork

[Verse 2]
What's your favorite posish?
That's cool with me, it's not my favorite but I'll do it for you
What's your favorite dish?
I'm not gonna cook it but I'll order it from Zanzibar

And then I'm 'onna love you completely
And then I'll fucking fuck you discreetly
And then I'll fucking bone you completely

[Outro]
But then I'm gonna fuck you hard!
