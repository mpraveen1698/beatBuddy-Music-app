[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, ayy
Ayy

[Chorus]
Runnin' away from you takes time and pain
And I don't even want to
So, I'm gettin' high all week without you
Poppin' pills, thinkin' about you (Thinkin' about you)
Runnin' away from you takes time and pain
And I don't even want to
So, I'm gettin' high all week without you
Poppin' pills, thinkin' about you

[Bridge]
I wish I didn't have a heart to love you
(I wish I didn't have a heart to love you)
I wish I didn't play a part to break you
(I wish I didn't play a part to break you)
I wish I didn't do a lot of the shit I do
(The shit I do)
And I wish you didn't too
You might also like[Chorus]
Runnin' away from you takes time and pain
And I don't even want to
So, I'm gettin' high all week without you
Poppin' pills, thinkin' about you

[Bridge]
I wish I didn't have a heart to love you
(I wish I didn't have a heart to love you)
I wish I didn't play a part to break you
(I wish I didn't play a part to break you)
I wish I didn't do a lot of the shit I do
(The shit I do)
And I wish you didn't too
Tell me that you hate me
(I just wanna hear that)

Part 2: Sometimes Life Gets Fucked Up

[Chorus]
Sometimes life gets fucked up (Fucked up)
That's why we get fucked up (We get fucked up)
I can still feel your touch
I still do those same drugs
Sometimes life gets fucked up (Fucked up)
That's why we get fucked up (Fucked up)
I can still feel your touch
I still do those same drugs
[Verse]
That we used to do
I was used to you (I was used to you)
"What have you been through?"
She asked me
Every fuckin' kind of abuse
If you love me too
You would give me you (Give me you)
Lock me in your room
Don't tell me the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything you said (Everything you said)
Stays inside my head (Stays inside my head)
All the shit you said
All the blood I bled

[Chorus]
Sometimes life gets fucked up (Fucked up)
That's why we get fucked up (We get fucked up)
I can still feel your touch
I still do those same drugs
Sometimes life gets fucked up (Fucked up)
That's why we get fucked up (Fucked up)
I can still feel your touch
I still do those same drugs82Embed U Said Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 Lil Peep emo
