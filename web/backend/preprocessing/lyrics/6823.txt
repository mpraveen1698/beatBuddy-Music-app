1 ContributorYou LyricsAll these little things you do to me
I hope you know you’re home to me
With your hands around my heart

And after all
The little things you say may be so unfair
Got your fingers tangled in my hair
It’s like I’ve never known my worth
And when you lie, it doesn’t hurt

Pullin’ on my heart
No, it’s not your fault
I’ve been searching for you
I’ve been waiting for you

I guess that I found
Another reason I’ve been holding my smile
When you’re not around
I could never try to get through to you
There’s a rhythm in what we have

Slowly dancing, wounds are mending
I feel
Your body shaking
You think my love’s unsure
I’ll be the one to judge
You might also likeBut I’ll suffer the fall for love

You
Don’t have to catch me
You
I hope that you’ll learn
What it’s like to hurt
When you fall too low
And when you lie it doesn’t hurt

Pullin’ on my heart
No, it’s not your fault
I’ve been searching for you
I’ve been waiting for you

I guess that I found
What it means to be with you

I know that it’s true
Why you walking away?
I’ll be there when you fall
I’m not gonna be here some day
Don’t you waste what I have
Tell me where you wanna go
Let me know
When you know
I’ll be waiting right here for you
Feeding off my love
Addicted to my touch
I don’t wanna be the one to give it all
I don’t wanna be the one to give it all

Pending on my love
I’ve given all my trust
Love you, no typo
And when you lie it doesn’t hurt

Pullin’ on my heart
No, it’s not your fault
I’ve been searching for you
I’ve been waiting for you

Guess that I found
It’s that I found you
You
I guess that I found you
I found you
I guess that I found youEmbed You 6FEET Louyah sad
