If you have an opinion
Maybe you should shove it
Or maybe you could scream it
Might be best to keep it

[Pre-Chorus]
To yourself (To yourself)
To yourself (To yourself)

[Chorus]
This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out
Oh, why?
This is why

[Verse 2]
Better have conviction
'Cause we want crimes of passion
Survival of the fittest
You're either with us or you can keep it

[Pre-Chorus]
To yourself (To yourself)
To yourself (To yourself)
To yourself, yourself, yourself
To yourself (To yourself)

This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out
Oh, why?
This is why
This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out
Oh, why?
This is why

[Bridge]
One step beyond your door
It might as well have been a free fall
One step beyond your door
Falling down an endless hall
One step beyond your door
Might as well have been a free fall
One step beyond your door
And I'm floating like a cannonball

[Chorus]
This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out
Oh, why?
This is why
This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear
But, oh no, you won't catch me out
Oh, why?
