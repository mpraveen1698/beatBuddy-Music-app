7 ContributorsFever Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]
Cold sweats in the middle of the night
And flashbacks of you and I in your sweats
How’d you make mean feel so nice?
Now I’m starting to see this new guy
But it just don’t feel right
Even though he might be

[Pre-Chorus]
And you’re so bad for me
But I want your love every morning
Waking up with him but I wish you’d call me
I still miss our extremes, like

[Chorus]
Your "come over" texts at midnight
Rolling out of bed for your lies
Putting glitter on my blind eyes
Loving you wasn't as it seemed
And finding the good in bad and ugly
Deep down knowing you don't love me
I'd leave again before the morning
Loving you was a fever dream

[Verse 2]
I must havе been so sick
For your touch to be the fix
Fell in lovе with being used
Now he showers me with gifts and flowers
But I miss taking showers with you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But you’re so bad for me
But I want your love every morning
Waking up with him but I wish you’d call me
I still miss our extremes, like

[Chorus]
Your "come over" texts at midnight
Rolling out of bed for your lies
Putting glitter on my blind eyes
Loving you wasn't as it seemed
And finding good in bad and ugly
Deep down knowing you don’t love me
I'd leave again before the morning
Loving you was a fever dream4Embed Fever Dream Fever Dream Jillian Rossi singer-songwriter
