20 ContributorsThe Story Lyrics[Verse 1]
All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am

[Chorus]
But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to, it's true
I was made for you

[Verse 2]
I climbed across the mountaintops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
But baby, I broke them all for you

[Chorus]
Oh, because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks, you do
I was made for you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You see the smile that's on my mouth
It's hiding the words that don't come out
And all of our friends who think that I'm blessed
They don't know my head is a mess

No, they don't know who I really am
And they don't know what I've been through like you do
And I was made for you

[Breakdown]
All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am

[Chorus]
Oh, but these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to, it's true
I was made for you

[Outro]
Oh yeah, well, it's true
That I was made for you11Embed The Story The Story Brandi Carlile acoustic
