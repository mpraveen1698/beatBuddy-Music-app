The Chainsmokers & Coldplay - Something just like this
Kygo & Selena Gomez - It ain't me
Major Lazer - Lean on

[Verse]
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

[Bridge]
I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

[Verse 2]
I had a dream
We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery
Nowhere's high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough

[Bridge 2]
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

[Refrain]
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
[Verse 3]
Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other

But the night was warm
And we were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
(We would only hold on to let go)

[Bridge 3]
She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

[Refrain]
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like thisEmbed It Ain't Me (with Selena Gomez) It Ain't Me (with Selena Gomez) Kygo;Selena Gomez dance
