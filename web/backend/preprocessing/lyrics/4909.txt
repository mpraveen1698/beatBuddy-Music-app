16 ContributorsApril Come She Will Lyrics[Verse 1]
April, come she will
When streams are ripe and swelled with rain
May, she will stay
Resting in my arms again

[Verse 2]
June, she’ll change her tune
In restless walks, she’ll prowl the night
July, she will fly
And give no warning to her flight

[Verse 3]
August, die she must
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold
September, I’ll remember
A love once new has now grown oldYou might also like7Embed April Come She Will Sounds Of Silence Simon & Garfunkel folk
