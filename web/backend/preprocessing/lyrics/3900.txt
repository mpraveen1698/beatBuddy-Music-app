6 ContributorsWith You Lyrics[Chorus]
No, I'm not feeling like myself
I feel like I've been someone else with you (with you, with you, with you)
Yeah, with you (with you, with you, with you)

[Verse 1]
I feel like a lunatic, is it hard to tell?
I know that you know the stakes
You know me so well, so, so well, oh, so well
I don't wanna treat you like this every single night
Texting you, "I'm sorry" every morning, it's not right
That's not me, baby, I'm not me lately

[Pre-Chorus]
Half of me is not enough of me to give
'Cause something's missing, but I just don't know what it is

[Chorus]
All I know is that I'm not feeling like myself
I feel like I've been someone else with you (with you, with you, with you)
Yeah, with you (with you, with you, with you)
All I know is that I'm not feeling like myself
I feel like I've been someone else with you (with you, with you, with you)
Yeah, with you (with you, with you, with you)

[Verse 2]
Know I'd need some clarity, shit we just ignore
What's the point of honesty if it just hurts us more?
I'm not sure, baby, I'm at war
I don't wanna be the guy your parents want
That's exactly what I feel like, feel like I've become
That's not me, baby, I'm not me lately

Half of me is not enough of me to give
'Cause something's missing, but I just don't know what it is

[Chorus]
All I know is that I'm not feeling like myself
I feel like I've been someone else with you (with you, with you, with you)
Yeah, with you (with you, with you, with you)
All I know is that I'm not feeling like myself
I feel like I've been someone else with you (with you, with you, with you)
Yeah, with you (with you, with you, with you)

[Outro]
No, I just haven't been myself with you (with you, with you, with you)
Ooh (with you, with you, with you)
No, I'm not feeling like myself with you (with you, with you, with you)
No (with you, with you, with you)
