Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like​
Na-na-na-na, every day (Lil Tjay)
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
I got some funny feelings in my head and, girl, I don't know what to call it (Call)
Too iffy and quick, I can't say that it's love, but I know that I want some more of it (More)
These feelings been stuck in my head, ain't too big on love, but with you, I'm all for it (No)
See the world, me and you, we can tour it
Like, fuck all them bitches, ain't shit to ignore it (Oh)
Daily, you be on my mind, my heart hurt, beat, and bruised from the owner before it (Oh)
Got a good feeling this time, I been focused on you and I cannot ignore it (No)
Better than all of them combined
See, nothin' bеtter than callin' you mine (Oh)
You a ten out of tеn, you a dime
Fuck all the others, leave that shit behind

[Verse 1]
Girl, you ever loved a gangster? (No)
Got a feelin' that you never did (Nah)
It's a different type of love, different type of hug
Tryna catch it from a kid (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I been through mad stuff
And my background and past rough (Rough)
Takin' shots, got my glass up
My life started a disaster (Star)
Lately, feelings just been faster
Trench Kid preachin' like a pastor
You been on my mind, shit been out of line
Normally, I be on Casper
Normally, I keep it smooth
Guard up high like I'm a master
But it's somethin' 'bout you
I can't see through

[Verse 2]
Sidestep, that's my flex
And you gon' die if you keep tryna play games
All I know is treacherous, fuck around, it's straight flames
Hate pain, but it's all through my veins
Rollin' dope, it go straight to my mind
How you be feelin', I'm one of a kind
Can't no one hold me back, how they gon' hold me back?
Destined to win, ain't no blockin' my shine
Took me a minute, I waited
Every year, shit get greater, I'm stuck in my prime
Soon get better, it's way more than fine
I be the type to just say less and grind
[Outro]
