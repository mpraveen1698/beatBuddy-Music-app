I'm the man in the box
Buried in my shit

[Pre-Chorus: Layne Staley]
Won't you come and save me?
Save me

[Chorus: Layne Staley & Jerry Cantrell]
Feed my eyes
(Can you sew them shut?)
Jesus Christ
(Deny your maker)
He who tries
(Will be wasted)
Oh, feed my eyes
(Now you've sewn them) shut

[Verse 2: Layne Staley]
I'm the dog who gets beat
Shove my nose in shit

[Pre-Chorus: Layne Staley]
Won't you come and save me?
Save me
