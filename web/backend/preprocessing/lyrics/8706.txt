You're in my sights
There's a mist on my lens
I think you know how it was
When I tripped and fell
Well, you double-dealed me, baby
And I broke like a shell, hey
Like a bad penny you've sure lost the glow
But I'm out of reach
Your smile's sure gone cold
Well, it can't ever be like it was then
Well, don't you fool with me, baby
Don't you mess with my plans, hey

Some stormy nights
Your memory haunts me
You won't go away

Well, like a bad penny you
Have turned up in the change
Try to fit into the picture
You can't get inside the frame
I think you know I'm still sore
But I'm on the mend
Times sure have changed
It won't happen again

Well, you won't know what's gone wrong
When it all falls down
You got to learn from now on
To stop playing games
You ought to keep on moving
You got to spin on your way

Some lonely nights
I hear you calling
Won't you go away?

Well, like a bad penny you
Have turned up again
You're in my sights
There's a mist on my lens
I think you know how it was
When I tripped and fell
Well, you double-dealed me, baby
I cracked like a shell1Embed Bad Penny Top Priority (Remastered 2017) Rory Gallagher blues
