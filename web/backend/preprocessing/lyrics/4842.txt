5 ContributorsSkydance Lyrics[Verse]
No regrets, I'm falling
Won't hold back, I'm all in
And we're too far now to pull back
Even if I could, I don't want that
When I see you, it's electric
No I couldn't go unaffected
And it's too sweet now to leave you
Even if I could, I don't want to

[Chorus]
Hey, call me cause I'm waiting
Oh I'm waiting for you, baby
I miss you, alright?
I miss you, alright? alright
Riding on my brain waves
Asleep or when I'm awake
Baby, I'm thinking of you
You should be dancing with me

[Drop]
Hey, call me cause I'm waiting
Oh I'm waiting for you, baby
I miss you, alright?
I miss you, alright? alright

Hey, call me cause I'm waiting
Oh I'm waiting for you, baby
I miss you, alright?
I miss you, alright? alright
Riding on my brain waves
Asleep or when I'm awake
Baby, I'm thinking of you
You should be dancing with me

[Drop]
Hey, call me cause I'm waiting
Oh I'm waiting for you, baby
I miss you, alright?
I miss you, alright? alrightEmbed Skydance Skydance W&W;AXMO;Giin trance
