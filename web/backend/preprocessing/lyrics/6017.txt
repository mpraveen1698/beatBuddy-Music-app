3 ContributorsFuck Em All Lyrics[Chorus: Sunny Malton]
Yeah!
They was praying I fall
But all I did was just ball
Against the laws, I stood tall
Fuck em all, fuck em all
They was praying I fall
But all I did was just ball
Against the laws, I stood tall
Fuck em all, fuck em all

[Verse 1: Sunny Malton]
Shit, I put my pride to the side
I'ma be a legend when I die
How the fuck you gonna know if you don't try
Everything I told y'all was all facts, no lie
Shit, we came in for the win, not to tie
But we suited and booted 'cause my homies stay fly
But all I do was rise
They gon bury my success
But their hate is televised
How many came, how many gone
Most of them did me wrong
I got pain in my heart
So I put it on a song
Now my papеr sky high
These places I don't bеlong
When it comes to the drama
I ain't trying to get involved
It's like that's why I stay low away from the info
Sipping on this henny but we blowing out the window
Yeah
Blowing out the window

They was praying and I fall
But all I did was just ball
Against the laws, I stood tall
Fuck em all, fuck em all
They was praying and I fall
But all I did was just ball
Against the laws, I stood tall
Fuck em all, fuck em all

(Oh dil da ni maaada)
Badle jo dekh ke mahaul
Fuck em all, fuck em all
Landua di chakkni ni call
Fuck em all, fuck em all
Badle jo dekh ke mahaul
Fuck em all, fuck em all
Landua di chakkni ni call
Fuck em all, fuck em all

[Verse 2: Sidhu Moose Wala]
Oh jitke yakeen saale, oh low kar jaande ne
Fayde fude laike, unfollow kar jaande ne
Kalyug daur ae jubaana hoyian aisiyan
Thhuk thhuk aap e swallow kar jaande ne
Oh pichho ustaad, pehla fan hunde kaas ton
Madde ne janaane, utto man hunde kaas ton
Kadi gaali utte kyon stand nahio rakhde?
Bhajjna e hunda, fir sign hunde kaas ton
Ho sakda ni thug jo koyi mathe te lakeer'an ne
Bhai kehke dhokhe, saare mariyaan jameera ne
Gaut laake hon na prove khaandaani aa
Paunde aa brand unjh andron ta leer'an ne
Ik mera hi banaaya, kehnda hit aa main geet'an ch
Dooja jhooth kehnda mera todd ni koyi beat'an ch
Dono kar dite saale fuck off life cho
Hit ton ki laina saale doglee aa neeet'an ch
Scary hours vich ehe bhulji na talju
Chhaddeya jo jhuth mood sadde ch na ralju
Hit hon waaste ni lod thhode jehaa di
Moose Wala naam bohot, dhakke naale chalju
