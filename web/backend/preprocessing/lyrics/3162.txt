40 ContributorsThe Resistance Lyrics[Verse 1: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
(I) am a nation, (I) am a million faces
Formed together, made for relevation
(I) am a soldier, (I) won't surrender
Faith is like a fire that never burns to embers
(Who's gonna stand up, who's gonna fight?)
The voice of the unheard
(Who's gonna break these chains and lies?)
Love is the answer
I gotta speak it, believe it, that's how I feel inside
I, I, can't, can't sit here quiet

[Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger]
You can take my heart, you can take my breath
When you pry it from my cold, dead chest

[Chorus: John Cooper]
This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

(Hey) Can you hear me? (Hey) Are you listening?
Sleeping in the shadows, could be making history
(Walk) through the fire, (Walk) on the water
Used to be a slave, but now you are a conqueror

[Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger]
They can take my heart, they can take my breath
When they pry it from my cold, dead chest

[Chorus: John Cooper]
This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

[Bridge: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
The voice of the unheard
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
Love is the answer
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
Love is the answer
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us
[Chorus: John Cooper]
This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us22Embed The Resistance Unleashed Skillet alt-rock
