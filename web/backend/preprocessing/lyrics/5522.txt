3 Contributorsâ€‹happier than ever Lyrics[Verse 1]
You called me again, drunk in your Benz
Driving home under the influence
You scared me to death
But I'm wasting my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 2]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fucking sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fucking leave me alone
(No, no, oh, oh)
I don't relate to you, no
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You make me hate this cityYou might also likeEmbed happier than ever happier than ever Loveless punk
