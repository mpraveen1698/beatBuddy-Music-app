I need you baby
Damn I need you all the time
Can’t seem to escape no
I can’t get you off my mind

[Chorus]
I need you baby
Damn I need you all the time
I can’t seem to escape no
I can’t get you off my mind
I’m pessimistic baby
Glass half empty I can’t change I
Can’t go all the way

[Verse 1]
Here we go, yea
Alone again
I’m safe and sound, yeah
I’m MIA, yeah
Weight of the world on me, yea
Waiting for the days to be, yea
Better off, better off
Better off if I just leave

[Chorus]
I need you baby
Damn I need you all the time
I can’t seem to escape no
I can’t get you off my mind
I’m pеssimistic baby
Glass half empty I can’t change I
Can’t go all the way

I got blessings and lessons
But who’s to say what’s next

[Chorus]
I need you baby
Damn I need you all the time
I can’t seem to escape no
I can’t get you off my mind
I’m pessimistic baby
Glass half empty I can’t change I
Can’t go all the way

Damn I need you all the time

I can’t get you off my mind
I’m pessimistic baby
