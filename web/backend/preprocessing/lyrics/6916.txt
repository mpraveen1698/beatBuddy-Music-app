3 ContributorsForget About You Lyrics[Verse 1: Devin Kennedy]
These days
When I'm walking the street
Every stranger I meet, I see
Your face
And I try to move on
But I'm tangled in memories of you
I wanna go out tonight
Get out of my head tonight
But I know it won't do

[Chorus: Devin Kennedy]
'Cause there ain't nobody fine enough
No, there ain't no drink that's strong enough
No, there ain't no high that's high enough
To make me forget about you (Forget about you)

[Verse 2: Pink Sweat$]
You're my favorite kind of song
I love to hear your voice and
Make love to your body all night long, mm (Yeah)
You're my favorite kind of wrong
But you feel so right
And I need you all the time

[Chorus: Pink Sweat$]
'Cause therе ain't nobody fine enough (Fine еnough)
And there ain't no drink this strong enough
And there ain't no high that's high enough (High enough)
To make me forget about you

Forget about you (Yeah, forget about you)
Can't forget about you (Can't forget about you)
Forget about you (Yeah, oh)
Can't forget about you (Can't forget about you)

[Chorus: Devin Kennedy]
No, no, there ain't nobody fine enough
There ain't no drink that's strong enough (Strong enough)
There ain't no high that's high enough (High enough)
To make me forget about you

[Post-Chorus: Devin Kennedy & Pink Sweat$]
Forget about you (Forget about you)
Can't forget about you (Can't forget about you)
Can't forget about you (Can't forget you, no)
Can't forget about you (Can't forget about you)1Embed Forget About You Poetry Devin Kennedy chill
