17 ContributorsTwo Weeks Lyrics[Verse 1]
And you neglected I called you out
Don't, please
I said, "We're stronger than this now"
You resurrected mistakes
Years past, it seemed
And they exist to still haunt you

[Pre-Chorus]
And still, you feel like the loneliness
Is better replaced by this
I don't believe it this way
And I can see the fear in your eyes
I've seen it materialize
Growing stronger each day

[Chorus]
I could see it as you turned to stone
Still clearly, I can hear you say:
"Don't leave, don't give up on me"
Two weeks and you ran away
I remember, don't lie to me
You couldn't see that it was not that way
Swear I never gave up on you!

[Verse 2]
I wanted nothing but for that trust again
And, brick by brick, you would take it
You feared of phantoms and none exist but you
You still saw fit to destroy it
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And still, you feel like the loneliness
Is better replaced by this
I don't believe it this way
And I can see the fear in your eyes
I've seen it materialize
Growing stronger each day

[Chorus]
I could see it as you turned to stone
Still clearly, I can hear you say:
"Don't leave, don't give up on me"
Two weeks and you ran away
I remember, don't lie to me
You couldn't see that it was not that way
Swear I never gave up on you!

[Verse 3]
And you neglected I called you out, don't please
I said, "We're stronger than this now"
You feared of phantoms and none exist but you
You still saw fit to destroy it

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can see the fear in your eyes
I've seen it materialize
Growing stronger each day
(I could see it as you turned to stone)
(Still clearly, I can hear you say:)
("Don't leave, don't give up on me")
(Two weeks and you ran away)

[Chorus]
I could see it as you turned to stone
Still clearly, I can hear you say:
"Don't leave, don't give up on me"
Two weeks and you ran away
I remember, don't lie to me
You couldn't see that it was not that way
Swear I never gave up on you!

I could see it as you turned to stone
Still clearly, I can hear you say:
"Don't leave, don't give up on me"
Two weeks and you ran away
I remember, don't lie to me
You couldn't see that it was not that way
Swear I never gave up on you!10Embed Two Weeks Overcome All That Remains metalcore
