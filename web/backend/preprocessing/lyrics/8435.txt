11 ContributorsParking Lots Lyrics[Verse 1]
Bent out boy in the car down the pavement
Turn here that's your place
Glitter girl in the back of the basement
Opened window frame

[Chorus]
Heather, wanna see you soon
If you do
Heather, when I'm in your room
"Love Me Do"

[Verse 2]
Empty lot has a guest close to midnight
Spilling out its sides
Something of going on in the streetlight
Mother sleeps just fine

[Chorus]
Heather, wanna see you soon
If you do
Heather, when I'm in your room
"Love Me Do"You might also like5Embed Parking Lots Jen Plums garage
