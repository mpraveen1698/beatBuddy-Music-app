Yeah, you!
Yeah, you!

[Verse 1: Brad Simpson, The Vamps]
I used to wanna be
Living like there's only me
But now I spend my time
Thinking 'bout a way to get you off my mind (Yeah, you!)
I used to be so tough
Never really gave enough
And then you caught my eye
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike (Yeah, you!)

[Pre-Chorus: Brad Simpson]
Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground I'm on, it keeps shaking
Oh-oh-oh, now!

[Chorus: The Vamps]
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
But every time I look at you I just don't care
'Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you (Yeah, you! Hahaha)

I used to run around
I didn't wanna settle down
But now I wake each day
Looking for a way that I can see your face (Yeah, you!)
I've got your photograph
But, baby, I need more than that
I need to know your lips
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this (Yeah, you!)

[Pre-Chorus: Brad Simpson & Demi Lovato]
Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground I'm on, it keeps shaking
Oh-oh-oh, now!

[Chorus: The Vamps]
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
But every time I look at you I just don't care
'Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you (Yeah, you!)
