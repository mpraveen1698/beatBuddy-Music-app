3 ContributorsBetter with You Lyrics[Gentle Bones]
You've been tossing and turning for far too long
Like what is some sleep to a life this long?
You're saying it's cold even with the heat
Constantly, you're finding it hard to trust

[Benjamin Kheng]
All the nights spent hurting
All the time they've stolen
Waiting on the day you see

[Gentle Bones, Benjamin Kheng]
No matter all the tears how long they stay
Don't question yourself, you will overcome
No matter how the fears may take you away
You're hard on yourself, but you're second to none
So darling, take a leap of faith, you are stronger than you imagine
You could never lеt me down
This world is better with you around

You'vе been lost in a daze living out of fear
Like what is a day to another year
You're saying convictions are costing me
Constantly, you're finding it hard to trust

[Benjamin Kheng]
Giving til it's gone
Awake until the morning
Staying up with you til you see
You might also likeWe need you over here, so won't you stay
You're doubting yourself, we've only begun
Cause if you're in your head know it'll be okay
You're finding yourself, and you'll never be done

[Gentle Bones, Benjamin Kheng]
So darling, take a leap of faith, you are greater than you imagine
You could never let me down
This world is better with you around

No matter all the tears how long they stay
Don't question yourself, you will overcome
No matter how the fears may take you away
You're hard on yourself, but you're second to none
So darling, take a leap of faith, you are stronger than you imagine
You could never let me down
This world is better with you

Running around the place
Once in a lifetime that you'll be dead
So leave us some room for the words unsaid
Honestly
This world is better with you around1Embed Better With You (with Benjamin Kheng) Gentle Bones Gentle Bones;Benjamin Kheng chill
