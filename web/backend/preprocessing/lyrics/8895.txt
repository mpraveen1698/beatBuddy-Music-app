4 ContributorsSomeone Else (Underoath Remix) Lyrics[Verse: Grabbitz]
I wake up in the bed you made
The one where you're supposed to lay with me
I smell you on the pillowcase
But don't see your face, and that's okay with me
I never thought I'd see the day (See the day)
I'd see you as somebody I could hate
I guess that's just the price I pay
For the blood-red flags that I walked past every day

[Chorus: Grabbitz]
Who are you when I'm not looking?
You're like an angel sent from hell
Despite those eyes that hooked me
When I'm not looking, you are someone else

[Drop: Spencer Chamberlin & Grabbitz]
Someone else
Someone else
Someone—
Someone else
Yeah!

[Chorus: Grabbitz]
Who are you when I'm not looking?
I doubt you even know yourself
Despite those lies that took me
When I'm not looking, you are someone else
You might also like[Bridge: Grabbitz]
Hey
Is it me? Did I fly you away?
Am I wrong? Are you not who I say?
If I call, which one of you will answer
Anyway?

[Chorus: Grabbitz & Spencer Chamberlin]
Who are you when I'm not looking?
You're like an angel sent from hell
Despite those eyes that hooked me
When I'm not looking,  you are someone else

[Chorus: Grabbitz & Spencer Chamberlain]
Who are you when I'm not looking? (When I'm not looking)
I doubt you even know yourself
Despite those lies that took me
When I'm not looking, you are someone else

[Outro: Spencer Chamberlin & Grabbitz]
Someone else
Someone-
Yeah!
When I'm not looking, you are someone elseEmbed Someone Else Someone Else Rezz;Grabbitz electronic
