17 ContributorsSuicidal Lyrics[Intro: Wett Brain]
(You wanna do something funky? Hahaha)
And this bed's too big for me without you
I doubt you'll ever feel the same
I got a massive hole inside my heart
Girl, it screams your stupid fuckin' name

[Chorus: Wett Brain]
And you got me feelin' suicidal
Might go surfing by myself
And if a wave happens to pull me under
I doubt I'd even scream for help
No way
Feelin' suicidal
I should just probably kill myself
And now I'm feelin' suicidal
Close my eyes and slit my wrists
Might help

[Verse 1: Wett Brain]
Hoe, you wasn't nothing but a Louis V fleshlight
Stylin' on them bitches like a Louis print fleshlight
I was in my bag, I was tryna get my cash right
Always wanna spazz out, I don't like to act right
And I'm feelin' suicidal
I don't pray to god, I ain't ever read the bible
Fuck that
If you catch me on a bad day
Down bad, gеt the fuck up out of my way!

And now I'm feelin' suicidal

[Verse 2: Tommy Ice]
I don't need no help to take these drugs
I ain't suicidal, flexin' on my idols (Idols)
I was tellin' 'em all walk a mile in my shoes
But you just cannot afford them (Yeah)
I did hella drugs 'cause of boredom ('Cause of boredom)
Straight out of Balenciaga (Yeah)
She don't got a father (Uh)
Hennessey im sippin' like it's water like it's aqua
And I was suicidal, fuck that shit, I'm getting comments (Uhh)
Raised by streets, only made it 'cause my mama

[Chorus: Wett Brain]
And you got me feelin' suicidal
Might go surfing by myself
And if a wave happens to pull me under
I doubt I'd even scream for help
No way
Feelin' suicidal
I should just probably kill myself
And now I'm feelin' suicidal
Close my eyes and slit my wrists
