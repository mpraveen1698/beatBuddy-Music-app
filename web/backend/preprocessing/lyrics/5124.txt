11 ContributorsWalk Thru Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
Talk to me
Spill the secrets you've been keeping
Life cuts deep
Let me help pick up the pieces

[Pre-Chorus]
You're not alone, I'm by your side
Don't you know, don't you know
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire
No matter what, I'll make it right
Don't you know, don't you know
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire

[Chorus]
I'm not an angel, I'm not a saint
I've been a closed book full of mistakes
But when you're broken, when you're in pain
Oooh, ooh
I'll walk through fire with you

[Post-Chorus]
I'll walk through fire
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire

I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire
