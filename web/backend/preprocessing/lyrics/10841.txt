Loving you harder won't fix you
I know we both got different issues
But I, I wanna be the girl you
Say that you can't get enough of
It's way too damn easy to love ya
But you, you can't reciprocate my time

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you care
You say you think about me
(Why can't you just reach out? Playin' with my feelings)
I, I'm way too blind to give no fucks about it
(I just want to hear ya, tell me that you need me)

[Chorus]
And if I don't text you first
I don't think that we would ever talk at all and
I don't know what's worse
Being with you, or not being with you at all?
I gave it a chance, I gave you energy
It's clear to me that you can't make this work
So tell me baby what's the point of lovin' if you're already gonе?

[Verse 2]
You won't come back
You said it yourself, I think you need help
So why do I wait for you?
Not doing too wеll
Running through my mind
Convinced that I'm fine, but really I'm the fool
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You say you care
You say you think about me
(Why can't you just reach out? Playin' with my feelings)
I, I'm way too blind to give no fucks about it
(I just want to hear ya, tell me that you need me)

[Chorus]
And if I don't text you first
I don't think that we would ever talk at all and
I don't know what's worse
Being with you, or not being with you at all?
I gave it a chance, I gave you energy
It's clear to me that you can't make this work
So tell me baby what's the point of lovin' if you're already gone?

[Outro]
You're already gone?
You're already gone?
Gone, mhm, gone?
You're already gone?
You're already gone?
