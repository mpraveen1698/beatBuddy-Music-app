Yeah

[Verse 1]
Let me take you back to when I was killed and born again
Woke up in the light convinced my life had made it to its end
Burning up beneath the sun while my father drained of blood
If he's there, I've got a message for the man that's up above
Fuck you

[Pre-Chorus]
If he's home, I've got a message from below
Getting out is not enough if nobody else can come
If he's home, I've got a message for the man above

[Chorus]
Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
So I can look you in the eye when I spit in your face
Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
Don't let 'em hit you on the way out when I take your place

[Verse 2]
Did you think you could dig deep enough to bury me?
It's over when I say and you're not getting rid of me
So walk into my fire or step into my light
Either way, it's gonna burn if you don't make this right, oh
Shit

If he's home, I've got a message from below

[Chorus]
Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
So I can look you in the eye when I spit in your face
Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
Don't let 'em hit you on the way out when I take your place

[Breakdown]
Dead meat

[Pre-Chorus]
Getting out is not enough if nobody else can come
If he's home, I've got a message for the man above

[Chorus]
Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
So I can look you in the eye when I spit in your face
Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
Don't let 'em hit you on the way out when I take your place
Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
So I can look you in the eye when I spit in your face
Here am I, take me to the pearly gates
Don't let 'em hit you on the way out when I take your place
