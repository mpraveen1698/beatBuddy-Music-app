3 ContributorsFingernails Lyrics[Intro]
I'm pulling off your fingernails one by one, by one, by one
I'm pulling off your fingernails one by one, by one, by one

[Verse 1]
God as my witness, no more compromise
I'm in the fight of my life
I've picked up the language and speaking it nice
I'm in the fight of my life
They taught me vicious so they recognize
I'm in the fight for my life
Blood on your hands and now blood covers mine
Having the time of my life with your fingernails

[Chorus]
(One by one, by one, by one)
Pulling off your fingernails
(One by onе, by one, by one)
Pulling off your fingernails
Out hеre promising to do my best
Out here thinking I don't know what's next
Out here (One by one, by one, by one)
Pulling off your fingernails one by one

[Verse 2]
Violence is history and history has rhymed
We got the fight of our lives
Sign the petitions so peaceful, so quiet
We got the fight of our lives
Won't be no victim, won't be no messiah
I'm in the fight for my life
Days meant for love and there's days meant for ire
I had the time of my life

I'm pulling off your fingernails one by one
Pulling off your fingernails one by one

[Chorus]
(One by one, by one, by one)
Pulling off your fingernails
(One by one, by one, by one)
Pulling off your fingernails
Out here promising to do my best
Out here thinking I don't know what's next
Out here (One by one, by one, by one)
Pulling off your fingernails one by one

[Bridge]
Why you wasted
Why you wasted
Why you wasted
Why you wasted
One by one, by one, by one
One by one, by one, by one
One by one, by one, by one
One by one, by one, by one
One by one, by one, by one
One by one, by one, by one
One by one, by one, by one
One by one, by one, by one
One by one, by one, by one
One by one, by one, by one
[Outro]
Out here promising to do my best
Out here thinking I don't know what's next
Out here
Pulling off your fingernails one by one, by one, by one1Embed Fingernails Fingernails DON BROCO british
