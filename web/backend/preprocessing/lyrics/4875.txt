1 ContributorHeaven Lyrics[Chorus]
Baby, you're all that I want
When I was lyin' there in your arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
It was heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
Isn't too hard to see
It was heaven

[Verse 1]
You remember that summer
Thought it would never end
San Antonio sunsets
Felt that we were more than friends
Found ourselves on the beach alone
Love how we never made it home
Don't know, no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though we knew it weren't forever
We still made each day and night our own
And now every time I think about it
I wish we never let it go

[Chorus]
Baby, you're all that I want
When I was lyin' there in your arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
It was heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
Isn't too hard to see
It was heaven

[Verse 2]
Got me missin' that sunshine
Livin' life with no cares
If we could only just go back
I'd click my fingers, we'd be there
40-night holiday romance
Wakin' up with you on the sand

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though we knew it weren't forever
We still made each day and night our own
And now every time I think about it
I wish we never let it go

[Chorus]
Baby, you're all that I want
When I was lyin' there in your arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
It was heaven
