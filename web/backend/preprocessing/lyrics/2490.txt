8 ContributorsCanâ€™t Help Falling in Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you

[Verse 2]
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

[Verse 3]
So take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with youYou might also like1Embed Can't Help Falling In Love Crazy Rich Asians (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Kina Grannis acoustic
