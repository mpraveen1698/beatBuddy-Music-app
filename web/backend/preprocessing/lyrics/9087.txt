6 ContributorsHelp Me LyricsYou got to help me
I can't do it all by myself
You got to help me, baby
I can't do it all by myself
You know if you don't help me darling
I'll have to find myself, somebody else

I may have to wash, I may have to sew
I may have to cook, I might mop the floor
But you help me baby
You know if you don't help me darling
I'll find myself somebody else

When I walk, you walk with me
When I talk, you talk to me
Oh baby, I can't do it all by myself
You know if you don't help me darling
I'll have to find myself, somebody else
Help me, help me darlin'

Bring my nightshirt
Put on your morning gown
Oh, bring me my nightshirt
Put on your morning gown
Darlin' I know we sleep bare
But I just don't feel like lyin' down, oh yeah keepYou might also likeEmbed Help Me More Real Folk Blues Sonny Boy Williamson II acoustic
