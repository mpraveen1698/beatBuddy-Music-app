7 ContributorsKeeping Me Under Lyrics[Verse 1]
Speak your peace man
But you make it quick
Why can't we just don't run and hide from all of this 'cause
All my planning, I'ma stay within
Why can't you open up and try to let me in, girl?
I'm feeling like I'm outta hand
Think you come and complicate things
When I'm doing well
'Cause it's only the finest for you girl
No you never used to mind this life before

[Chorus]
Oh no, I can't say anything
You're keeping me under, under wraps
Am I really that, that embarrassing?
That you're keeping me under, under wraps

[Vese 2]
Catch me up
Trip me over
Can't be warm when your so cold
I'll be walking, gone for days 'cause
I know that you'll be home
And now I feel it like I'm outta here
Then you come complicate things
When I'm doing well
'Cause it's only the finest for you girl
No, you never used to mind this life before

Oh no, I can't say anything
You're keeping me under, under wraps
Am I really that, that embarrassing?
That you're keeping me under, under wraps

[Verse 3]
Catch a cab, you'll be home by ten
Cause I told you once but I'll tell you all again 'cause
All my planning I'm the one with sins
Come on just open up and try to let me in girl

[Verse 4]
You're keeping me under, you're keeping me on
You're making me violent, you're making me slow
You're making it easy, you're making it hard
No I won't let you get your stars

[Chorus]
Oh no, I can't say anything
You're keeping me under, under  wraps
Am I really that, that embarrassing?
That you're keeping me under, under wraps

[Chorus]
Oh no, I can't say anything
You're keeping me under, under wraps
Am I really that, that embarrassing?
That you're keeping me under, under wraps

[Verse 5]
You're keeping me under, you're keeping me on
You're making me violent, you're making me slow
You're making it easy, you're making it hard
No I won't let you get your stars2Embed Keeping Me Under Keeping Me Under Two Another french
