4 ContributorsKeeper LyricsLate night
What's your intention?
Got a bible to swear on
Not satisfied, oh temptation
Oh no, hold on

I'm a keeper baby
Honestly
All my life, all my days, always
I'm a keeper baby
Honestly
All my life, all my days, always

Survive on your footsteps
Just a cold call away
Your light, blinding me
Like a goldmine, unfound

I'm a keeper baby
Honestly
All my life, all my days, always
I'm a keeper baby
Honestly
All my life, all my days, alwaysYou might also likeEmbed Keeper Hear Me Out Reignwolf garage
