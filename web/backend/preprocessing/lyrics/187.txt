Da-ra-ta-ta-ta

[Verse]
People say I'm not gonna change, not gonna change
I know that you like that, you know where my mind's at
Can't be tamed, I'm not gonna play, not gonna play
Oh no, I ain't like that, fuck 'em, I'm a wild cat

[Chorus]
Baby, break my heart
Give me all you got
Don't ask "Why, why, why?"
Don't be shy, shy, shy
Is it love or lust?
I can't get enough
Don't ask "Why, why, why?"
Don't be shy, shy, shy
