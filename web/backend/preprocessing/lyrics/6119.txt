Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Looking back
I know I was walking around in disguise
It's a fact
I was just a lost soul, I needed a guide

[Pre-Chorus]
And the moment that you came to change my life
(Put me back together, yeah)
You fired up my heart and made me smile
And you and I know that

[Chorus]
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around, world around

[Verse 2]
Dreams I had
All fading away by the minute and I
Feel alive
You untwisted all of my troubles inside
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Like a little piece of heaven finally found
(Put me back together, yeah)
You rebuilt my heart up from the ground
And you and I know, baby

[Chorus]
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around (Oh, yeah, yeah)
I'm a different person, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Turn my world around (Turn my world around)
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around, world around  (Oh, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Ooh, you fired up my heart and made me smile
And you and I know, baby

[Chorus]
Turn my world around
Oh, yeah, yeah
I'm a different person, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Turn my world around (Turn my world around)
I'm a different person, yeah (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Turn my world around
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around, world around1Embed Lola's Theme - Radio Edit Lola's Theme The Shapeshifters deep-house
