Let's tell the world all the things we've done
Falling in love in the setting sun
I got a song and a smile so bright
I'll make you wish you were here tonight

[Verse 1]
All of the places we ever go
Feel familiar, I'm never alone
All of the people that I don't know
Will be looking me up when they all get home

[Chorus]
Let's tell the world all the things we've done
Falling in love and the setting sun
I've got a song and a smile so bright
I'll make you wish you were here tonight

[Verse 2]
And if you tell the world your secrets
You never know
What's set in stone
And what can grow

[Bridge]
Tell the world
Tell the world
I'm gonna tell the world
Tell the world
Tell the world
That I got something on my mind
You might also like[Chorus]
Let's tell the world all the things we've done
Falling in love and the setting sun
I've got a song and a smile so bright
I'll make you wish you were here tonightEmbed Tell The World Pure Fiction Eric Hutchinson acoustic
