We don't stop, but the time do
Lovers in another life, let me remind you
Look back, see me behind you
When it feels good you don't have to try to

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you say so
If you say so
Then let's go
I know you're all that I wanted since I met ya
What do I gotta do to get ya?

[Chorus]
On the back of my motorbike
Switch lanes, 29, ooh (Ooh)
It's whatever you like, ooh
On the back of my motorbike
Write your name in the sky, ooh (Ooh)
It's whatever you like
We can ride, ride, ride

[Verse 2]
Girl, go ahead and leave ya keys on thе dresser
You ain't gonna need them tonight
You'rе hotter than a desert, don't mean no pressure
I just wanna make you feel right
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And if you say so
If you say so
Then let's go
I know you're all that I wanted since I met ya
What do I gotta do to get ya?

[Chorus]
On the back of my motorbike
Switch lanes, 29, ooh (Ooh)
It's whatever you like, ooh
On the back of my motorbike
Write your name in the sky, ooh (Ooh)
It's whatever you like
We can ride, ride, ride

[Bridge]
We don't stop, but the time do, do
When it feels good, you don't have to try to, to

[Chorus]
On the back of my motorbike
Switch lanes, 29, ooh (Ooh)
It's whatever you like, ooh
On the back of my motorbike
Write your name in the sky, ooh (Ooh)
It's whatever you like
We can ride, ride, ride1Embed Motorbike Gold-Diggers Sound Leon Bridges blues
