10 ContributorsEmpty Bed Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your footsteps on the stairs
If I listen hard enough, they're still there
You think I'd know better by now

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still drink until you're next to me again, baby
Yea, yea, yea
And I still think that in the morning I might wake up next to you

[Chorus]
Empty bed and empty space
It's in my head, your smell, your taste
Your memory is all that's left
To fill this empty, fill this empty bed

[Drop]
This empty bed
Fill this empty

[Verse 2]
And your pictures on my phone
Help me to pretend that I'm not alone
You think I'd know better by now

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still drink until you're next to me again, baby
Yea, yea, yea
And I still think that in the morning I might wake up next to you
You might also like[Chorus]
Empty bed and empty space
It's in my head, your smell, your taste
Your memory is all that's left
To fill this empty, fill this empty bed

[Drop]
This empty bed

[Bridge]
But I still drink until you're next to me again, baby
And I still think that in the morning I might wake up next to you

[Chorus]
Empty bed and empty space
It's in my head, your smell, your taste
Your memory is all that's left
To fill this empty, fill this empty bed

[Drop]
This empty bed
Fill this empty bed
This empty
Fill this empty bed
This empty
Fill this emptyEmbed Empty Bed Empty Bed Saint Punk club
