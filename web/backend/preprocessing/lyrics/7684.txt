(Say my name, say my name, name)

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say “baby I love you”
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady, ain't calling me baby
Why the sudden change?
(Say my name, say my name, name)
(Say my name, say my name, name)

[Verse 1]
Any other day, I would call, you would say (Say)
"Baby, how's your day?", but today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh, yeah ok"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around, and be played
So prove yourself to me, if I'm the one that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who
You might also like[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say “baby I love you”
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady, ain't calling me baby
Why the sudden change?
(Say my name, say my name, name)
(Say my name, say my name, name)
Baby, yeah say my name

No, no
(Say my name, say my name)

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say “baby I love you”
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady, ain't calling me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say “baby I love you”
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady, ain't calling me baby
Better say my name
(Say my name, say my name, name)
