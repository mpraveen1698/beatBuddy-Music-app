Have you been writing those letters to yourself? "Dear Evan Hansen, this is gonna be a good day and here's why"
[EVAN, spoken]
I started one.​

[HEIDI, spoken]
Those letters are important, honey. They're gonna help you build your confidence.​

[EVAN, spoken]
I guess.​

[HEIDI, sung]
Can we try to have an optimistic outlook, huh?
Can we buck up just enough to see the world won't fall apart?
Maybe this year, we decide
We're not giving up before we've tried
This year, we make a new start

[HEIDI, spoken]
Hey! I know! You can go around today and ask the other kids to sign your cast. How 'bout that?

[EVAN, spoken]
Perfect.​

[HEIDI, spoken]
I'm proud of you already.​

Another stellar conversation for the scrapbook
Another stumble as I'm reaching for the right thing to say
I'm kinda coming up empty
Can't find my way to you
Does anybody have a map?
Anybody maybe happen to know how the hell to do this?
I don't know if you can tell
But this is me just pretending to know

So where's the map?
I need a clue
'Cause the scary truth is
I'm flying blind
And I'm making this up as I go
[CYNTHIA, spoken]
It's your senior year, Connor. You are not missing the first day.​

[CONNOR, spoken]
I already said I'd go tomorrow.​
[LARRY, spoken]
He doesn't listen. Look at him, he's probably high.​
[ZOE, spoken]
He's definitely high.​

[CYNTHIA, spoken]
I don't want you going to school high, Connor.​

[CONNOR, spoken]
Perfect, so then I won't go. Thanks, Mom!

[CYNTHIA, sung]
Another masterful attempt ends with disaster

[LARRY, spoken]
Interstate's already jammed.​

[CYNTHIA, sung]
Pour another cup of coffee
And watch it all crash and burn

[ZOE, spoken]
Connor finished the milk!

[CYNTHIA, sung]
It's a puzzle, it's a maze
I try to steer through it a million ways
But each day's another wrong turn
[LARRY, spoken]
I better head out.​

[ZOE, spoken]
If Connor's not ready, I'm leaving without him.​

[CYNTHIA]
Does anybody have a map?
 
Anybody maybe—
[HEIDI]
Anybody have a map?
[BOTH]
—happen to know how the hell to do this?
I don't know if you can tell
But this is me just pretending to know

[HEIDI]
So where's the map?

[CYNTHIA]
I need a clue

[BOTH]
'Cause the scary truth is

[CYNTHIA]
I'm flying
​blind
I'm flying
​blind

[HEIDI]
I'm flying
​blind
I'm flying—

[BOTH]
I'm flying blind
And I'm making this up as I go
