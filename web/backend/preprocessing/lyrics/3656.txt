I don't know why I'm like this, I'd love to piss you off
Somethin' in my psychosis finds it a little hard
I always got good intentions, you tell me I saved your life
But I'm cravin' your attention (And you know that I got two sides)

[Chorus]
I'll be the villain tonight
I kinda like when you despise me after we fight
(Feels so much better when I'm)
Pushin' all your buttons 'til you're crawlin' on the floor
You say you hate my guts, but you're still comin' back for more

[Verse 2]
I know that you get jealous, so I'll play the fantasy
I know it gives you hell when everyone looks at me
Some of my favorite moments usually start with tears
Swear that you'll pull me closer whenever we flirt with fear

[Chorus]
I'll be the villain tonight
I kinda like when you despise me after we fight
(Feels so much better when I'm)
Pushin' all your buttons 'til you're crawlin' on the floor
You say you hate my guts, but you're still comin' back for more

The villain, uh, uh, the villain, I'll be
The villain, uh, uh, the villain, I'll be
The villain, uh, uh, the villain, I'll be
The villain, uh, uh, the villain, I'll be

[Bridge]
What's you and I without a little pain?
Tastes bittersweet each time you say my name
If love was poison, we would drink it anyways
Feels so good playing these wicked little games

[Chorus]
I'll be the villain tonight
I kinda like when you despise me after we fight
(Feels so much better when I'm)
Pushin' all your buttons 'til you're crawlin' on the floor
You say you hate my guts, but you're still comin' back for more

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be
The villain, uh, uh, the villain, I'll be
The villain, uh, uh, the villain, I'll be
The villain, uh, uh, the villain, I'll be
The villain, uh, uh, the villain, I'll be4Embed Villain Dolls EP Bella Poarch alternative
