They say it's a matter of time
A thousand days and the sun won't shine
Before I come back to you

[Chorus]
And I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way

[Verse 2]
For your love, I will go far
I wanna be wherever you are
I know I'm coming back for you
Our love is a river long
The best right in a million wrongs
I know I'm coming back to you

[Chorus]
And I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way
I go solo, oh, I go solo
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way

[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
