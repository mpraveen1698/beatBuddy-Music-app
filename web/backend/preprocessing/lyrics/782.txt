Da-da-da-da-da-da (Jason Derulo)

[Verse 1]
Pull up, skrrt-skrrt on your body
Performin' just like my 'Rari
You're too fine, need a ticket
I bet you taste expensive
Pourin' up, up, up by the liter
If you keepin' up, you's a keeper
Tequila and vodka
Girl, you might be a problem

[Pre-Chorus]
Run away, run away, run away, run away, I know that I should
But my heart wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay now
You can see it in my eyes that I wanna take you down right now if I could
So I hope you know what I mean when I say

[Chorus]
Let me take you dancin'
Two-step to the bedroom
We don't need no dancefloor
Let me see your best move
Anything could happen
Ever since I met you
No need to imagine
Baby, all I'm asking
Is let me take you dancing

Pull up, skrrt-skrrt on your body
It's just us two in this party
That Louis, that Prada
Looks so much better off ya
Turn me up, up, up, be my waitress
Know we not in love, so let's make it
Tequila and vodka
Girl, you might be a problem
