3 ContributorsOne Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
We fell outta love
We thought that we lost
But now I see there's nothing better than us, than us

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me chasin’ memories
Just so I can feel ya
You got me wishin' nothing changed
Oh, I think I need ya
I think I need ya right now

[Chorus]
All we ever get is one life
So I think that we better spend it right
I don't wanna waste one more afternoon
Being alone and not here with you
All we ever get is one life
So I think that we better spend it right
’Cause we got way too much time to lose
So let me know if you want me too
So let me know if you want me too

[Post-Chorus]
So let me know if you want me too
So let me know if you want me too

We made a mistake
Lettin' us slip away
But let's forget everything that happened, my love, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me chasin' memories
Just so I can feel ya
You got me wishin' nothing changed
Oh, I think I need ya
I think I need ya right now

[Chorus]
All we ever get is one life
So I think that we better spend it right
I don't wanna waste one more afternoon
Being alone and not here with you
All we ever get is one life
So I think that we better spend it right
'Cause we got way too much time to lose
So let me know if you want me too
So let me know if you want me too

[Post-Chorus]
So let me know if you want me too1Embed One Life One Life Mike Perry swedish
