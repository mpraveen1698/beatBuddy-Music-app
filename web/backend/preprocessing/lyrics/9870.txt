16 ContributorsNice Guy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Brother's on his way
Praying up to ten times a day
Till he finds out
He has something more to say
Over the same old gal
Possible life long pal
But what did she mean
When she said she'd be your pal?

[Chorus]
Sweet and shy
Nice, nice guy
Forget the finish line
You're wasting someone's time
Sweet and shy
Nice, nice guy
Forget the finish line
You're wasting someone's time

[Verse 2]
Over the same old song
Many moments making no sense
It's Ramadan in the sun
Everyone's at fault
Some won't ever last
Waking up to break their fast
In the moment it seemed
The day could easily pass
You might also like[Chorus]
Sweet and shy
Nice, nice guy
Forget the finish line
You're wasting someone's time
Sweet and shy
Nice, nice guy
Forget the finish line
You're wasting someone's time
Sweet and shy
Nice, nice guy
Forget the finish line
You're wasting someone's time
Sweet and shy
Nice, nice guy
Forget the finish line
You're wasting someone's time...2Embed Nice Guy Untitled '91 Hector Gachan garage
