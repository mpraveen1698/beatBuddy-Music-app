Talking like we used to do
It was always me and you
Shaping up and shipping out
Check me in and check me out
Do you like walking in the rain?
When you think of love, do you think of pain?
You can tell me what you see
I will choose what I believe

[Chorus]
Well, hold on, darling
This body is yours
This body is yours and mine
Well, hold on, my darling
This mess was yours
Now your mess is mine
Ah, ooh
Your mess is mine

[Verse 2]
See you in the marketplace
Walkin 'round at 8:00am
I got two hours before my flight
Luck, be on my side tonight
You're the reason that I feel so strong
The reason that I'm hanging on
You know you gave me all that time
Well, did I give enough of mine?

Well, hold on, darling
This body is yours
This body is yours and mine
Well, hold on, my darling
This mess was yours
Now your mess is mine
Ooh, ah, ah
Your mess is mine
Your mess is mine

[Bridge]
Bring me to your house
Tell me, "Sorry for the mess", hey, I don't mind
You're talking in your sleep, out of time
Well, you still make sense to me, your mess is mine
Ah, ooh

[Outro]
Your mess is mine
This body is yours and this body is mine
Ooh, ooh
Your mess is mine
Your mess is mine54Embed Mess Is Mine Dream Your Life Away Vance Joy folk
