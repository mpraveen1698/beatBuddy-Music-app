4 ContributorsNot Used To Normal Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't sleep in my own bed often
I'm afraid of home base
I'm more for home runs, no talking
Then running away
Your room's spotless, top to bottom
No wrinkles in your sheets
The most complicated part of your life is me, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
My ex predicted that I'd be a mess
He must've been psychic, the nail on the head
I need a psychiatrist, need better friends
'Cause I don't want this to end, oh

[Chorus]
I'm not used to normal, forgive me if I
Go ahead and fuck this up, my default's self destruct
Oh, I'm not used to normal, so I'd understand if you
Wanna let me go 'cause normals all you know, no

[Post-Chorus]
No-no-no-not used to normal
No-no-no-not used to normal
Not usеd to normal

My family is nice, but often in crisis
It gets bad all thе time
Always a fight, in screams or in silence
We cross every line, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
My ex predicted that I'd be a mess
He must've been psychic, the nail on the head
I need a psychiatrist, need better friends
'Cause I don't want this to end, oh

[Chorus]
I'm not used to normal, forgive me if I
Go ahead and fuck this up, my default's self destruct
Oh, I'm not used to normal, so I'd understand if you
Wanna let me go 'cause normals all you know, no

[Post-Chorus]
No-no-no-not used to normal
No-no-no-not used to normal
No-no-no-not used to normal
