Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
I'm the trouble starter, punkin' instigator
I'm the fear addicted, the danger illustrated
Hey, hey, hey
I'm a fire starter, twisted fire starter
Hey, hey, hey
You're a fire starter, twisted fire starter
Hey, hey, hey
I'm a fire starter, twisted fire starter

[Verse 2]
I'm the bitch you hated, filth infatuated (Yeah)
I'm the pain you tasted, fell intoxicated
Hey, hey, hey
I'm a fire starter, twisted fire starter
Hey, hey, hey
You're a fire starter, twisted fire starter
Hey, hey, hey

[Interlude]
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
I'm the self-inflicted mind detonator, yeah
I'm the one infected, twisted animator
Hey, hey, hey
I'm a fire starter, twisted fire starter
Hey, hey, hey
You're a fire starter, twisted fire starter
Hey, hey, hey
I'm the a starter, twisted fire starter (Starter)
