There's an army on the dance floor
It's a fashion with a gun, my love
In a room without a door
A kiss is not enough

[Chorus]
Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

[Verse 2]
They'd put us on a railroad
They'd dearly make us pay
For laughing in their faces and making it our way
There's emptiness behind their eyes
There's dust in all their hearts
They just want to steal us all and take us all apart, but not

[Chorus]
Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes
Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

[Verse 3]
So swallow all your fears, my love
And put on your new face
You can never win or lose
If you don't run the race, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
