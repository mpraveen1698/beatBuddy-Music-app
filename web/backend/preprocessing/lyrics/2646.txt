Once I had a shotgun to my head
They said I wasn't worth the bullets
Now the world is my trigger
And I'm here to fucking pull it
Once had a shotgun to my head
They said I wasn't worth the bullets
Now the world is my trigger
And I'm here to fucking pull it

[Chorus]
Still here! (Still here!)
I can't hesitate
Eyes wide open pupils dilate
Still here! (Right here!)
Set to detonate
I see the swarm the scavengers await

[Post-Chorus]
No sleep! No rest!
If that's what it takes to be the best
No sleep! No rest!
Must stay driven I can't relent

[Verse 1]
Once had a knife to my throat
They said I'd wind up in the dirt
I know the ones who doubt me
Are the ones that really hurt

Still here! (Still here!)
I can't hesitate
Eyes wide open, pupils dilate
Still here! (Right here!)
Set to detonate
I see the swarm the scavengers await

[Post-Chorus]
No sleep! No rest!
If that's what it takes to be the best
No sleep! No rest!
Must stay driven, I can't relent

[Verse 2]
Came from the gutter, just missed the grave
Now looking down the barrel of today
Start from nothing, stop at nothing, hell-bent
Never put myself in that position again
Now I'm looking down the barrel of today!

[Bridge]
Once had a shotgun to my head
They said I wasn't worth the bullets
Now the world is my trigger
I'll fucking pull it!
[Pre-Chorus]
Once I had a shotgun to my head
They said I wasn't worth the bullets
Now the world is my trigger
And I'm gonna fucking pull it

[Chorus]
No sleep! No rest!
Must do what it takes to be the best
No sleep! No rest!
Do anything that it takes to be the best!2Embed Looking Down the Barrel of Today The Concrete Confessional Hatebreed metalcore
