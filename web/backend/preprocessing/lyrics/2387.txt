60 ContributorsGooey Lyrics[Verse 1]
Alright, come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinnin' round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky, gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky, smooth perfume

[Pre-Chorus]
Right, my little Pooh Bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I'd say I told you so, but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy-topsy slurs
I can't take this place, no, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

[Verse 2]
Truth be told
I've been there, I've done this all before
I take your gloom
I cut it up and puff it into plumes

Right, my little Pooh Bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I'd say I told you so, but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy-topsy slurs
I can't take this place, no, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space
[Bridge]
Hold my hand and float back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows, now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you? How can I be nice?
Trippin' round the tree stumps in your summer smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Right, my little Pooh Bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I'd say I told you so, but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy-topsy slurs
I can't take this place, no, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space111Embed Gooey ZABA Glass Animals indie-pop
