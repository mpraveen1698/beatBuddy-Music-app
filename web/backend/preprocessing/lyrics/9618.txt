3 ContributorsGoodbye [Radio Edit] LyricsIs someone listening?
OK

Let me tell you this story
It was that guy
First you loved, then you promised
Two of us losing control, crazy night, intense sex

Now, living, my own life
Got you out of my (mind)
Have, me wasting, too much time
Gonna leave you far behind

Then, you ran away
Are you thinking of me?
When you f*ck her?
Doubt you know you were supposed to love me
Till the day (you)
Almost
Kill me

Now, living, my own life
Got you out of my mind
Have, me wasting, too much time
Gonna leave you far behind

Gonna leave you far behind

Got you out of my mind
Have, me wasting, too much time
Gonna leave you far behindEmbed Goodbye (feat. Lyse) - Radio Edit Goodbye (feat. Lyse) [Radio Edit] Feder;Lyse french
