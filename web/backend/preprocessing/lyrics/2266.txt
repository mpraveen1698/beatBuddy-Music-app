15 ContributorsHoliday / Boulevard of Broken Dreams Lyrics[Part I: Holiday]

[Intro]
Say hey
Cha

[Verse 1]
Hear the sound of the fallin' rain
Comin' down like an Armageddon flame (Hey)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howlin' out of key
To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (Hey)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

[Verse 2]
Hear the drum poundin' out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument
See Green Day LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also like[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
(Hey)

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Three, four
The representative from California has the floor

[Bridge]
Sieg Heil to the President Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel Towers
Who criticize your government
Bang-bang goes the broken glass, and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, settin' fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just 'cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Just 'cause, because we're outlaws, yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday
[Part II: Boulevard of Broken Dreams]

[Verse 1]
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a—

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
[Verse 2]
I'm walkin' down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a—

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, and I walk a—

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a—

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone
