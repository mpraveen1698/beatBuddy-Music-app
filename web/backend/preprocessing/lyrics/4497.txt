4 ContributorsWaves Lyrics[Verse 1]
Is there something
After there is nothing to say?
We’re just moving in circles
But we’re losing our shape

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, where did all the good things go? (Did they, did they go)
Oh, falling out of love too slow

[Chorus]
It’s a beautiful morning
Don’t throw it away
If I gave you the sunset, you’d wish for the rain
Do you even notice
What I’m trying to say?
If I gave you the ocean, you’d complain 'bout the waves

[Verse 2]
Guess there’s nothing
Feels like I’m not doing this right
Like a star that slowly disappears in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, where did all the good things go? (Wherе did they go, where did thеy go?)
Oh, falling out of love too slow (It's too slow)
You might also like[Refrain]
It’s a beautiful morning
Don’t throw it away
If I gave you the sunset, you’d wish for the rain
Do you even notice
What I’m trying to say?
If I gave you the ocean, you’d complain 'bout the waves

[Chorus]
It’s a beautiful morning
Don’t throw it away
If I gave you the sunset, you’d wish for the rain
Do you even notice
What I’m trying to say?
If I gave you the ocean, you’d complain 'bout the waves1Embed Waves Waves Fiji Blue chill
