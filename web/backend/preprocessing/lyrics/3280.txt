28 ContributorsPieces Lyrics[Verse 1]
I tried to be perfect, but nothin' was worth it
I don't believe it makes me real
I thought it'd be easy, but no one believes me
I meant all the things I said

[Chorus]
If you believe it's in my soul
I'd say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show
That I'm tryin' to let you know
That I'm better off on my own

[Verse 2]
This place is so empty, my thoughts are so tempting
I don't know how it got so bad
Sometimes it's so crazy that nothing can save me
But it's the only thing that I have

[Chorus]
If you believe it's in my soul
I'd say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show
That I'm tryin' to let you know
That I'm better off on my own

On my own!

[Verse 3]
I tried to be perfect, it just wasn't worth it
Nothing could ever be so wrong
It's hard to believe me, it never gets easy
I guess I knew that all along

[Chorus]
If you believe it's in my soul
I'd say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show
That I'm tryin' to let you know
That I'm better off on my own28Embed Pieces Chuck Sum 41 punk
