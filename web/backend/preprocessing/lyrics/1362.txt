What would you do?
If I told you I loved you, baby
What would you do?
If I told you I need you, baby
Would you come through?
If I told you to kiss me, babe
What would you do?
What would you do?
What would you do?

[Drop]
What would you do, do, do? Huh?
What would you do, do, do, do? Huh?
What would you do, do, do? Huh?
If I told you I loved you, babe
What would you do?

[Post-Chorus]
What would you do? (What would you do?)
What would you do? (What would you do?)
What would you do? (What would you do?)
If I told you I loved you, babe
What would you do?

[Verse]
This may come as a surprise
But I keep how I feel inside, and tonight
There ain't nothin' left to hide
Still got one question on my mind
My mind, on my mind
Would you stay or would you run away?
I'm not saying forever
But you got me feelin' some type of way
Are you down? 'Cause I really gotta know...

If I told you I need you, baby
Would you come through?
If I told you to kiss me, babe
What would you do?
What would you do?
What would you do?

[Drop]
What would you do, do, do? Huh?
What would you do, do, do, do? Huh?
What would you do, do, do? Huh?
If I told you I loved you, babe
What would you do?

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm losin' my mind
Said I'm losin' my mind
Tryna keep it insi-i-ide
Said I'm losin' my mind
Said I'm losin' my mind

[Chorus]
What would you do?

Would you come through?
If I told you to kiss me, babe
