12 ContributorsTil the Right One Comes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well the lucky in love called themselves winners
And losers are sinners who have gone astray
As if I woke up lonely one morning
Looked around and decided I would stay that way

[Chorus]
You knock me down and you call me crazy
You say I'm never gonna love someone
Give it time now and you might find maybe
I'll prove you wrong when the right one comes
Won't be long til the right one comes

[Verse 2]
And I know people broke down and defeated
Lost what they needed in some miserable war
So forgive me if I might look around for a minute
Before jumping right in it, I just want to be sure

[Chorus]
Some people 'round here been calling me crazy
Some people say I'll never love someone
That's alright, give it time and maybe
I prove you wrong when the right one comes
Won't be long til the right one comes
You might also like[Verse 3]
Now I'm lying in my bed, the end of a long day
Headed the wrong way down that highway of dreams
When you're little unsure of what you're headed for
The end of the road ain't as close as it seems

[Chorus]
Some people 'round here been calling me crazy
"Must be something he's been running from"
Stick around now and you might find maybe
Prove you wrong when the right one comes
Won't be long til the right one comes
Til the right one comes
Til the right one comes

[Outro]
Who's that knocking at my door
Is it someone I've been looking for
And who's that throwing arms around me
And telling me she finally found me
Til the right one comes
Til the right one comes
Til the right one comes
Til the right one comes
Til the right one comes1Embed Til the Right One Comes Sob Rock John Mayer singer-songwriter
