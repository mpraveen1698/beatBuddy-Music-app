1 ContributorInto The Rain LyricsA moonlit night, the pouring rain
Lonely woman gone insane
A blinded man, a stolen car
Don't know who or what they are

[Chorus]
And it all dissolves
Yes it all dissolves
Into the rain
Into the rain
Into the rain

A single room,  A ceiling fan
Blows the dust from a dying man
A crowded room,  a lonely bar
Wishes crashing on a star

[Chorus]
And it all dissolves
Yes it all dissolves
Into the rain
Into the rain
Into the rain

An empty beach, crashing waves
Forgotten surfers, in their graves
You might also like[Chorus]
In the rain
Into the rain
Into the rain
In the rainEmbed Crowded Room Crowded Room Lonely in the Rain french
