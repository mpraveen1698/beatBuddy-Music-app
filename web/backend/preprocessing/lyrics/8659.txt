8 ContributorsReal Estate Lyrics[Verse 1]
I still find your hair in my bed
In my clothes, in my mouth
In my nose, oh, who knows?
If you'll still be there when
It's all said and done
Or if I'll just find less from now on

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I wonder
How I'd carry on without you

[Chorus]
I'm runnin' out of real estate
Tryna make all the right moves
I don't wanna hesitate
I would bet the house on you

[Post-Chorus]
You
You

[Verse 2]
I still have no windows
In my room or my halls
I was hoping I could look through yours
Sitting in a chair next to your front door
As I watch you do your makeup on the floor
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I wonder
How I'd carry on without you

[Chorus]
I'm runnin' out of real estate
Tryna make all the right moves
I don't wanna hesitate
I would bet the house on you

[Post-Chorus]
You
You
You

[Bridge]
I'm runnin' out of real estate
Tryna make all the right moves
I don't wanna hesitate
I would bet the house on you

[Chorus]
I'm runnin' out of real estate
Tryna make all the right moves
I don't wanna hesitate
I would bet the house on you
[Outro]
You
You
You
