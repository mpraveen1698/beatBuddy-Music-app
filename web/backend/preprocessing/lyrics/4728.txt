I'm sick of all this, "How'd you get your band name?"
"Is that your real first name?"
"Can you text and can you follow back 'cause it's my birthday?"
No one cares what I want, just what I've got
And if we sit and count it up, it's really not a lot

[Pre-Chorus]
So when are you gonna sing for me?
When are you gonna drink for me?
I don't know, I don't know
So when are you gonna sing for me?
Ruinin' me completely
It's true, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I miss having sex but at least I don't wanna die anymore
And I think that's pretty cool
I miss seeing the red on your face when I made you blush, hey
But I think it's fine, it's cool
But I think it's fine, it's cool

[Verse 2]
My hobbies include
Pushing away these girls that maybe really like me
Cutting people off because I don't trust exciting
But what the fuck have I done?
I'm not even an icon
But I still get death threats often
So their meaning starts to soften
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When are you gonna sing for me?
When are you gonna drink for me?
I don't know, I don't know
So when are you gonna sing for me?
Ruinin' me completely
It's true, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I miss having sex but at least I don't wanna die anymore
And I think that's pretty cool
I miss seeing the red on your face when I made you blush, hey
But I think it's fine, it's cool
I miss having sex but at least I don't wanna die anymore
And I think that's pretty cool
I miss seeing the red on your face when I made you blush
But I think it's fine, it's cool

[Outro]
But I think it's fine, it's cool
But I think it's fine, it's cool
But I think it's fine, it's cool
But I think it's fine, it's cool
But I think it's fine, it's cool
But I think it's fine, it's cool
But I think it's fine, it's cool10Embed I Miss Having Sex But At Least I Don't Wanna Die Anymore FANDOM Waterparks punk
