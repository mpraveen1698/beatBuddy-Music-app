56 Contributors2055 Lyrics[Intro]
Wanna slide
Like it's 2055, huh
I just wanna ride (Great John on the beat by the way)
Like it's 2055, huh
Huh, huh, huh

[Chorus]
I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said "Boy you nice, boy you nice", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice (Huh)

[Verse 1]
Why would you sacrifice (Huh)
Knowing you could die? Ain't nobody by your side, huh
I know niggas cap (Cap) and bitches lie
Came from dirt, can't go back, you could see it in my eyes, huh
Real niggas cry blood (Blood), hope my kid never try drugs (Huh)
All I wanted was some love, would that trade for a gun (Huh)
Big pack on me now, 'member back then I was fucked up, huh
I don't really want friends, everybody fake, I don't got trust, but

[Chorus]
I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said "Boy you nice, boy you nice", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice (Water and some ice, water and some ice)
I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said "Boy you nice" (Nice), "Boy you nice" (Nice), huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice

Shawty get energized, huh, livin' life
Spilled some liquor on her inner thigh, but she ain't tired
She just turn it up, huh, I could get you brushed, huh
Zaza got me stuck, sorry I can't open up
Fuck it we try (Huh), gotta compromise (Huh)
He want beef with gang, but he dont know it come with fries (Huh)
That's AKs and nines (Huh), please don't play with mines (Huh)
My body different, I know they love that line but

[Chorus]
I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said "Boy you nice (Nice), boy you nice (Nice)", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice (Water and some ice, water and some ice)19Embed 2055 Still Sleep? Sleepy Hallow r-n-b
