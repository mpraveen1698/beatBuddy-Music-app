I can remember when you left Kilkenny
And you told me, "I'll return next year"
I never meant to hold you to your promise
And the years went by and I'm still here

[Chorus]
So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the village fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me?

[Verse 2]
So is the outside world as you imaginеd?
Was it worth it severing the tiеs?
Happy to see me or a bit embarrassed?
There's a darkness deep in your blue eyes

[Chorus]
So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the village fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me?

[Outro]
When you danced with me
I miss the good old times when you danced with meYou might also like2Embed When You Danced With Me Voyage ABBA swedish
