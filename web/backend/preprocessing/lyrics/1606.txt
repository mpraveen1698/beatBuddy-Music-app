1 ContributorDive Lyrics[Verse 1]
From the small things that got in the way
To the roadblocks that we had to face
There's no moment I'd ever replace
'Cause it made us what we are

[Pre-Chorus]
All the days, all the nights
I'll be by your side
No, we don't have to rush
We can take our time
If you feel kinda lost
I'll be your light
We can leave this world behind, you and I

[Chorus]
I don't care what we call home
If you dive, I will follow
Through the fire and the smoke
If you dive, I will follow

[Post-Chorus]
(If you dive, I will follow)
If you dive, I will follow
(If you dive, I will follow)
If you dive, I will follow

From the small fights 'bout nothing at all
To the tough times when we hit a wall
There's no moment that I can recall
That I didn't wanna stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm, all the days, all the nights
I'll be by your side
No, we don't have to rush
We can take our time
If you feel kinda lost
I'll be your light
We can leave this world behind, you and I

[Chorus]
I don't care what we call home
If you dive, I will follow
Through the fire and the smoke
If you dive, I will follow

[Post-Chorus]
(If you dive, I will follow)
If you dive, I will follow
I don't care what we call home
If you dive, I will follow
Through the fire and the smoke
If you dive, I will followEmbed Dive Dive Hot Shade;Mike Perry;Chris James house
