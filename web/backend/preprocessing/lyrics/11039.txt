3 ContributorsFor a Feeling LyricsIt's like nothing ever works
And it only seems to hurt
Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel
We've been chasing old ideas
It's a lonely way to live
Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel

How I feel
Oh, baby

[Drop]

It's like nothing ever works
And it only seems to hurt
Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel
We've been chasing old ideas
It's a lonely way to live
Show me how you feel

I wish you would heal it
But you're killing me
All for a feeling
All for a feeling
I wish you would heal it
But you're killing me
All for a feeling
All for a feeling

I wish you would heal it
But you're killing me
All for a feeling
All for a feeling
I wish you would heal it
But you're killing me
All for a feeling
All for a feeling
