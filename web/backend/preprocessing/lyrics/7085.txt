1 ContributorReligion Lyrics[Intro]
I think I been doing it wrong this whole time

[Hook]
I been caught up in this real life
Back home, homie focused trying to get his bills right
But on the way, I had forgot what the sky feel like
Lemme touch these clouds
Hope I never come down
But don't get too high (x3)
I know the sky's cool and all
But it don't take much for you to fall..

[Verse 1]
Back in my zone
This the only place that niggas can't touch me
The only place where life ain't ugly
'cause out there, man they ain't love me
Student debt just the newest stress
Got a lot piling and it ain't money
So it's bump you, bump Uncle Sam and bump everything you can take from me
Left the pad like I'm playing rugby
Search for purpose, homie, everyday
Let me talk to God, let me read a book, let me catch the beat like I'm Anna Mae
Difference 'tween me and other niggas, when it come to truth, I don't hesitate
But these niggas sit and talk about the record all day and never set it straight
But I'm cut from a different cloth
Baby why don't you come find out
You probably know once you at my house, ain't no stopping the game like a timeout
I be having hella problems with women, say I never take time out
It really seems like falling in love is a hole that you can't never climb out
You might also like[Bridge]
That will get you high..
Did I get you high?
Guess not, so let's fly
Go!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Me and my last girl had a bad breakup
I was never around
Well baby girl that's a false statement
'cause the truth is I'm never on the ground
Man you only as high as you think
But you're never as high as you think
Man you're never as high as you think
Word to Fiend Bassy
I know that the team got me
Always thinking what this dream cost
'cause we need bills, nigga we ain't Cosby
Make a living off this God-given or we snatching jewels like a mean Nazi
Hot nigga, still about the schmoney
Nigga word to Schmurda, they ain't freeing Bobby
Really I'm just having fun with it
They hand it to me, I'ma run with it
Nothing's overnight so I'm taking life and everything else that come with it
'cause I know it's niggas out preying on me like a rosary
So mama just be praying over me, this exactly where I'm supposed to be
[Bridge]
Will I get too high?
Did I get too high?
Guess not, so let's fly
Go!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Don't get too- (x3)
(I know the sky's cool and all but it don't take much for you-)
Don't get too high..Embed Falling in Love Vertigo Holem sad
