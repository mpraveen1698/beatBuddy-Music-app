34 ContributorsWhiskey in the Jar Lyrics[Verse 1]
As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said, “Stand and deliver, or the devil, he may take you,” yeah
I took all of his money, and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she loved me, no, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy

[Chorus]
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

[Verse 2]
Being drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber
Taking money with me, but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven, yeah, in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols, and I shot him with both barrels, yeah

[Chorus]
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah-ah, whiskey in the jar-o
[Guitar solo]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Now some men like the fishing, and some men like the fowling
And some men like to hear, to hear the cannon ball a-roaring
Me? I like sleeping especially in Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

[Chorus]
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da, yeah, yeah
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There’s whiskey in the jar-o, yeah
Whiskey in the jar-o, yeah

[Outro]
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Hey, musha ring dum a doo dum a da
