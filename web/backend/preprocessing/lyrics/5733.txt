I know you know I'm not too discreet
Walking around, heart on my sleeve
So, you say you love me, but not the way I need
Things are so close to what I want to be
I've known you so long and maybe too well
All of the boys, you kiss-and-tell
Though, I'll never be them. See, I'm just a good friend
Though it's not quite bliss, I don't want this to end

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, she wants me to be loved
Oh, oh, she really, really does

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't stop feeling I want her love
But all my dreaming is not enough
So in the morning, the sun will rise
And I'll wake up and she won't be

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh she wants me to be loved
Oh, oh she really, really does

[Verse 2]
Let's take a walk down by the beach
It's warm on the sand, we'll save space for Jesus
I'll pick you flowers while you count the hours
'Til you can go home and watch drama TV

Maybe this time will be different for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh she wants me to be loved
Oh, oh she really, really does

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't stop feeling I want her love
But all my dreaming is not enough
So in the morning, the sun will rise
And I'll wake up and she won't be

[Bridge]
One day you'll love me before we grow old
All of your wishes to have and to hold
I'll do your dishes and ask for no kisses
So, I'll tell you what I want if you tell me what you want is

Quit movin', quit dancin'
Why can't you love me here tonight?

[Chorus 2]
I can't stop feeling, I want her love
But all my dreaming is not enough
So in the morning, the sun will rise
And I'll wake up and she won't be mine
I can't stop feeling, I want her love
But all my dreaming is not enough
So in the morning, the sun will rise
And I'll wake up and she won't be

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh she wants me to be loved
Oh, oh she really, really does

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh she wants me to be loved
Oh, oh she really, really doesEmbed She Wants Me (To Be Loved) What Could Be Better The Happy Fits j-rock
