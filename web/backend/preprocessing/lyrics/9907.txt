1 ContributorRevenge LyricsYeah
I know you’re famous for them
I haven’t been famous yet
I like music, but I don’t like your music you know?
Eminem destroy through kamikaze, I’m destroy through revenge

Yeah
During the breaks of some days I heard a lot
So let me explain what is the actual plot
Eminem created kill shot; you made that kill shot as bull shot
I’ve no hope, maybe one day my song archive actual jackpot
All the people diss me, some I remember, some I forgot
I forgot all, but I request you forgot-me-not
Because I was made a flop song which name is killing shot?

Motherfucker, you know nothing, you yell more
I’m sorry wait
I find lot of shit rappers, you know what?
They say I know everything; the truth is I’m only great
You hate what I make
I thought I’d say nothing at first but now I can’t tolerate
I archive your hate
What’s your talent?
Oh critiquing
My talent Oh bitch
I don’t know
You mention me, millions of views
You get attention in news
I mention you, I’ve no views
I make best songs, but I’m not in any news
First I made songs, people said you need reviews
Peoples you don’t know you just lit the fuse
Don’t get misconstrued, so get this shit to do
You always hate me, when I need you
Cause I don’t understand what the fuck you’re listening to do
You might also likeDo you have no idea how much I get diss from you and what is my flow
I’ve no choppy flow, I’ve a supersonic flow
What everyone always copy through
I get this your fucking “Loca” audio
Your audio is my shit
But all Indian people is busy to hear the bitch
Not even dissing it just ain’t for me
I search Indian rap, I found a shit rapper just like MC
Indian hip-hop industry is full of garbage, do you understand what I mean
I write my all songs with a cup of tea
But maybe you’re cup is full of syrup and lean
Maybe I made best song but they don’t give attention because they can’t beat me


You want to make me ill
Because your diss song suddenly hit
I like English songs, you can’t beat
I don’t like mumble, I like hard trap beat
When I release a song, you just hate it
I’m basically independent artist; give the support
But I’m not mumble, just like m-u-m-b-l-e


In the past I made songs that are classic
But the real position of your song is my dick
Make a song about who you have a wide lipstick
You’re mumble so you don’t care about your lyrics
I’m a science student; let me explain what is physics
For a long year, I learned how to rhyming
Now I’m professional, I know actual tactic
Why dissolve me? So you want to fuck my bitch? (Suck my dick)
Now I turned to some deshi toxic
Scrolling down I found a ship rapper who is MC
He makes nasty songs that people tell him fantastic
The music you make doesn’t read generic
I’ve a request that please make a song logistic
Jesus Christ, man how many times is someone gonna fuck my bitch (fuck my side chick)

Now I back turned to year 2019
Someone said my content my song is shit type
Then I’m not answer him, now I’m answer him you’re song is bitch type
I like music, so understand all
I don’t need your fucking advice so please mouth shut
I was always try to forget now it’s your time to forget
Indian rappers are doesn’t understand rap they just understand what is their profit
But seriously I’m not understand how they fuck the track

But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy of the matters LP
To tell me to study and learn something (wooooo)

I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I’d kill your hip-hop industry, bitch you’re don’t know me (yeaaaah)

So
Finger bang, chicken Wang
Old boy, Emiway
Everybody in the game
So I mentioned you anyway
Doesn’t matter what I say
Because give me donkey other day
What a way for 2019 to get underway
But I’m gonna say everything that I wanna say
Because I’m always a humble
You don’t do anything else, just drink a bottle
I don’t participate in fucking battle
Because I’m always winner in your fucking battle
Honey Singh like mumble, but I’m sorry I like lyrical
Maybe I can be hit, but believe me always I’m casual
I saw everywhere motherfucking couple
You can be devil, but bitch I’m also evil
You don’t concentrate your rap; you just concentrate about your facial
I was make song gamble with my imagination but now I see you’re a real gamble
Now I’m an English rapper but I diss a Hindi and Bengali rapper
I know bitch it’s completely legal
You can’t understand what is my level
Because for me you’re too little
Some drinks too, and make himself a mental
I’m the best English rapper and I’m always normal
I know diss song is harmful and painful
Now I make this situation because I want kill you peaceful

But saying I no longer got it caused you missed a line and never caught it cause it went over your head
Because you’re too stupid to get it cause you’re mentally retarded
You can’t make something with proper languages; you just hit the bottle, and now you why you speared
When I said I like music and I’ll kill hip-hop industry so now time is come to broke your fucking forehead
But you’ll never be artist and I’m harder on I than you could ever be regardless
What I’ll be never in flow less
Even all rappers are busy to get new song but you’re busy in fucking alcoholic
But after you come back you don’t change you again with fucking alcoholic
And you interest in fucking mumble

Mumble is my bitch
And you are shit
Do you have any songs that new generations need?
I get in beefs, my enemies die, I don’t ceased
Fire till at least all are decreased
I’m west side, I know you fuck better old boy east side
You got some fucking fans that’s have no guide
When I sing better they cried because they feel like they died
Ok I know you all understand
But you don’t what is actual bitch

Aw man!
The crypt cypher was weak
It was garbage the thing ain’t even arrange
Oh my god that’s a reach

Every fuck up rappers who don’t understand what is rap
They always said my rap is shit
I’m not believe god, because I’m the believe I’m the god
Some people diss me all the time
But believe me I’m don’t give a fuck

So
Finger bang, chicken Wang
Old boy, Emiway
Everybody in the game
So I mentioned you anyway
Doesn’t matter what I say
Because give me donkey other day
What a way for 2019 to get underway
But I’m gonna say everything that I wanna say

You motherfucker how you sing, I’ll diss you an another way
On the other side, I’m a producer, I already make the way


Welcome Krishna, bitch
Invite me in your house one day
I’m not done

I’m not diss you as your way
I’ll diss you an another way
Because I’m not diss you, I want to teach you
I’m here previous one year so don’t call me new
I made this song, it will long song it’s 5:32
Maybe I’m late, but believe me I’m old, I’m not new
Now you destroy all songs, now what people do?
You make loca, one bottle down now you need review
You don’t understand what is actual hip-hop, how you said I’m huge
Other rappers has fucking tattoo
But I’m interested in fresh skin, I’ve no tattoos
I know this rap will end but my diss will be continue
Indian rappers always make fucking songs
And media always make motherfucking news

Hold up hold up hold up
I said media always make actual news

I make songs but they just can to abuse
Explicit is my song, but you like always bamboos
You gave the name song is and you sing another I’m confuse
Indian rappers are don’t know what is actual rap, so they give you overviews

You’ll give a fucking dislike to this video
But bitch you goes angry, you don’t understand actual meaning if the video
I was hear what you sing in your fucking show
You can’t sing you start your song as yo, yo
I don’t know what the fuck other pop singers said, but my flow is overflow
I’m an English rapper, I’ve a dictionary, and I’m in fucking blow
Obviously I’m psycho
I’m psycho about my rap
You all not my same, you’re half
When I sing rap obviously you motherfucking people laugh
And you said I’m not sing rap, I’ve no proper languages
But now you need to mouth shutEmbed One Bottle Down One Bottle Down Yo Yo Honey Singh hip-hop
