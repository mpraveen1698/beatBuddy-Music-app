27 Contributors​tired of california Lyrics[Intro]
(I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of LA)
(Where the real thing comes as often as the California rain)

[Verse 1]
I get sick of sunshine on my perfect skin
Vapid conversation giving me the spins
Driving down Mulholland, closing both my eyes
'Cause they say you get more famous when you die

[Pre-Chorus]
And everyone seems fine
Am I losing my mind?

[Chorus]
I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of LA
Where the real thing comes as often as the California rain
I got all these legal toxins in my blood and in my brain
I keep saying that I'm leaving, but it doesn't work that way

[Verse 2]
I can't feel my hеartbeat way up in the Hills
Burning down my mansion, didn't write a will
Front row at my funеral, crocodile tears
Came here for the weekend, but I haven't left in years
(Is that weird?)

I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of LA
Where the real thing comes as often as the California rain
I got all these legal toxins in my blood and in my brain
I keep saying that I'm leaving, but it doesn't work that way

[Bridge]
Can I be young forever?
Would it be fun forever?
Can I be young forever?
Would it be fun forever?

[Chorus]
(We're so tired of California, we're so tired of LA)
(Where the real thing comes as often as the California rain)
(We got all these legal toxins in our blood and in our brain)
(We keep saying that we're leaving, but it doesn't work that way)

[Outro]
I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of LA
Where the real thing comes as often as the California rain
I got all these legal toxins in my blood and in my brain
I keep saying that I'm leaving, but it doesn't work that way2Embed tired of california tired of california Nessa Barrett electro
