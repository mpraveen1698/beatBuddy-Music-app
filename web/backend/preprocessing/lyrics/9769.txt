3 ContributorsFloat Through The Ceiling Lyrics[Verse 1]
They say time will heal it
I say I've been feeling
Miles and miles away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold my hand, I get lonely
When I'm in my head
The same old stories
Told by all my friends
We get lonely
Here we go again, go again
Where do we go when we've lived
And then we die?

[Chorus]
I was lost, now I'm found
Couple ups, couple downs
All my friends are out of town
Probly why I wanna float through the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling I felt
I was lost, now I’m found
I was lost, now I'm found
Couple ups, couple downs
All my friends arе out of town
Probly why I wanna float through the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling I felt
I was lost, now I'm found

Fall into your arms, I'm so high
I can barеly see the ground
I'll probably float till I die
Met a god he told me
Hover time to free up my mind
I'm undercover, feeling colors
Wake me up, so I fall in time

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold my hand, I get lonely
When I'm in my head
The same old stories
Told by all my friends
We get lonely
Here we go again, go again
Where do we go when we've lived
And then we die?

[Chorus]
I was lost, now I'm found
Couple ups, couple downs
All my friends are out of town
Probly why I wanna float through the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling I felt
I was lost, now I'm found
I was lost, now I'm found
Couple ups, couple downs
All my friends are out of town
Probly why I wanna float through the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling I felt
I was lost, now I'm foundEmbed Float Through The Ceiling Float Through The Ceiling DWLLRS chill
