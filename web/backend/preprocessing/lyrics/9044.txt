6 ContributorsGirl Lyrics[Verse 1]
So you say you've never been in love
That you don't even know what that means
You thought you did, but now that it's over you think
"Can't even be half of the real thing"
And as time goes on and on
I can feel my heart growing colder and colder
But then I see your face in the crowd, I think
"How can it be, starting over?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause when you meet someone new
It all just takes over you
And you think that you never really tried
Open your heart, open your mind

[Chorus]
Girl, you're gonna take me
Back to a time when I loved and I meant it
Girl, you're gonna save me
Give me a chance, it's worth taking
Girl, you're gonna take me
Back to a time when I loved and I meant it
Girl, you're gonna save me
Give me a chance, it's worth taking

And we always say the same old things
And we always use the same tired lines
Staying up all night, talking it out
Ending up with no one on our side
And as time goes on and on
I can feel my heart growing colder and colder
But then I see your face in the crowd, I think
"How can it be, starting over?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause when you meet someone new
It all just takes over you
And you think that you never really tried
Open your heart, open your mind

[Chorus]
Girl, you're gonna take me
Back to a time when I loved and I meant it
Girl, you're gonna save me
Give me a chance, it's worth taking
Girl, you're gonna take me
Back to a time when I loved and I meant it
Girl, you're gonna save me
Give me a chance, it's worth taking
It's worth taking
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause when you meet someone new
It all just takes over you
And you think that you never really tried
And you think that you never really tried
And you think that you never really tried
Open your heart, open your mind

[Chorus]
Girl, you're gonna take me
Back to a time when I loved and I meant it
Girl, you're gonna save me
Give me a chance, it's worth taking
Girl, you're gonna take me
Back to a time when I loved and I meant it
Girl, you're gonna save me
Give me a chance, it's worth taking
Girl, you're gonna take me
Back to a time when I loved and I meant it
Girl, you're gonna save me
Give me a chance, it's worth taking
Girl, you're gonna take me
Back to a time when I loved and I meant it
Girl, you're gonna save me
Give me a chance, it's worth taking7Embed Girl Jukebox The Ghost Jukebox The Ghost piano
