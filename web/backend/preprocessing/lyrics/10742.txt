I know we both shared a past of regrets and scars
But we can leave 'em behind and jus run away far
We'll let the moon and the stars show us
Where we are tonight

[Hook 2]
I know we both like to laugh just like everyone else
I know it seems like the world wants to take that away
So grab a hold of my hand and we can leave this place
Tonight

[Verse]
When you get tired I'll bring you back to you're bad, rest you're head on my shoulder
Hold you tight in my arms when it's cold
Made a promisе that I'd never let go
Whеn you cry I'll make you laugh
And I'll say you look cute when you smile
I wanna be best that I can be for you
Cuz you're all that I ever needed and more
And I hope you feel the same way too
Cuz I don't know what I would do
If I wasn't here with you
I'd feel so alone (I won't let you feel alone again)
Don't wanna be alone (I won't let you feel alone again)
