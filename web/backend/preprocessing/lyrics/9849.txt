Uh, yeah, Angerfist
You already know
Punch you in the fucking face

Soon as I write this incredible song down, the decibel stomp down
Your chemical compound, I'm the king
The crown holder holdin' the throne
Murderous with a verse, that burns flesh to the bone
When I jot to the page, when I walk in the stage
And everybody hands up, like i'm cocking the guage
Scientific, I'm studied by an alien race
From the dark depths of space, soon as they drop the bass

Bounce (x2)

Soon as I write this incredible song down
The decibel stomp down
Your chemical compound
I'm the king (king (x6))
Bounce

When I jot to the page, when I walk in the stage
And everybody hands up, like i'm cocking the guage
Scientific, I'm studied by an alien race
From the dark depths of space, soon as they drop the bassYou might also likeEmbed Solid Stigma Diabolic Dice Angerfist techno
