1 ContributorParty’s Over Lyrics[Intro]
We're soaking wet, you're in my head
You're in my head, up in my head

[Verse 1]
It's half past 12 noon, meet up at Nobu
'Cause I, I need you again
Some days I want you, some days I loath you
And I, don't need a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh, you say by the time you come
The party's over
Oh, well, baby, tonight, guess it's goodbye, you won
My heart is sober

[Chorus]
We're soaking wet, you're in my head
You're in my head, up in my head
We're soaking wet, you're in my head
You're in my head, up in my head
We're soaking wet, you're in my hеad
You're in my head, up in my head
Wе're soaking wet, you're in my head
You're in my head, up in my head
You might also like[Verse 2]
You're on the Westside, sipping that Mai Tai
Then you, you need me again
Some days you want me (Want me), some days you hate me
Still you, just need a hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh, you say by the time you come
The party's over
Oh, well, baby, tonight, guess it's goodbye, you won
My heart is sober

[Chorus]
We're soaking wet, you're in my head
You're in my head, up in my head
We're soaking wet, you're in my head
You're in my head, up in my head
We're soaking wet, you're in my head
You're in my head, up in my head
We're soaking wet, you're in my head
You're in my head, up in my headEmbed Party's Over Party's Over Brando deep-house
