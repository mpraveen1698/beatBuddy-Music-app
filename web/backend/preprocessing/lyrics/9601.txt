5 ContributorsBack to You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't fight back, don't look at me like that
Don't forget I'll never quite forgive you
But I'll pretend to

Don't fight fair, and don't you cut your hair
Don't you make the same mistakes your father did
You are not him

[Chorus]
Well it's always back to you again, always back to you, my friend, you keep me on the run
I never learned to lose a fight, I ​never learned to grow up right
Now this is who we are
And how will I release you now?
How can I forgive myself when I'm still in love with you?
And it's always back to you again, always back to you, my friend
You keep me on the run

[Verse 2]
Well baby you're so famous but you sold out your soul
You wеnt and let it all go on a melody
Some kind of tragеdy

So quit your job, come sleep in my bed
We'll get by on our roses and our elegies
Things we could never see
You might also like[Chorus]
Well it's always back to you again, always back to you, my friend, You keep me on the run
I never learned to lose a fight, I ​never learned to grow up right
Now this is who we are
And how will I release you now?
How can I forgive myself when I'm still in love with you?
And it's always back to you again, always back to you, my friend
You keep me on the run

[Outro]
Well it's always back to you again, always back to you, my friend
Now look at what we've done1Embed Back to You The Shark in Your Water Flower Face ambient
