I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
'Cause I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

[Drop]
Don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

[Verse]
You know I'm down for whatever tonight
I don't need the finer things in life
No matter where I go, it's a good time, yeah
And I, I don't need to sit in VIP
Middle of the floor, that's where I'll be
Don't got a lot, but that's enough for me, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
