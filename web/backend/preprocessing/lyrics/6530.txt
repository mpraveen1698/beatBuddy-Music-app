22 ContributorsDreamer Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gazing through the window at the world outside
Wondering will mother earth survive
Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her sometime
After all, there's only just the two of us
And here we are still fighting for our lives
Watching all of history repeat itself time after time

[Chorus]
I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away
I'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days

[Verse 2]
I watch the sun go down like everyone of us
I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
A better place for those who will come after us, this time

[Chorus]
I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away, oh yeah
I'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days

[Bridge]
Your higher power may be God or Jesus Christ
It doesn't really matter much to me
Without each other's help, there ain't no hope for us
I'm living in a dream of fantasy, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
If only we could all just find serenity
It would be nice if we could live as one
When will all this anger, hate and bigotry be gone?

[Chorus]
I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away, today
I'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days, okay
I'm just a dreamer who's searching for the way, today
I'm just a dreamer, dreaming my life away, oh yeah, yeah, yeah8Embed Dreamer Down To Earth Ozzy Osbourne metal
