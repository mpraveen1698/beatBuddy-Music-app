40 ContributorsTempted Lyrics[Intro]
(I bought a toothbrush)

[Verse 1: Paul Carrack]
I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste
A flannel for my face
Pyjamas, a hairbrush
New shoes and a case
I said to my reflection
Let's get out of this place
Past the church and the steeple
The laundry on the hill
Billboards and the buildings
Memories of it still
Keep calling and calling
But forget it all, I know I will

[Chorus: Paul Carrack]
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on now that you have gone
There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

[Verse 2: Glenn Tilbrook, Paul Carrack & Elvis Costello]
I'm at the car park, the airport
The baggage carousel
The people keep on crowding
And wishing I was well
I said it's no occasion
It's no story I could tell
At my bedside, empty pocket
A foot without a sock
Your body gets much closer
I fumble for the clock
Alarmed by the seduction
I wish that it would stop

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on now that you have gone
There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

[Verse 3: Paul Carrack]
I bought a novel, some perfume
A fortune all for you
But it's not my conscience
That hates to be untrue
I asked of my reflection
Tell me what is there to do?

[Chorus, Paul Carrack]
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on now that you have gone
There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

[Outro]
Oh, tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered5Embed Tempted East Side Story Squeeze power-pop
