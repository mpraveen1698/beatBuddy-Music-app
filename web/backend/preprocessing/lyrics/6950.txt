We were sitting in the car with the radio on
We were at a red light, I looked at you and saw
You in the light, never seen such life
As we slowly took a left, it never felt so right

[Verse]
I would always be the first one to say that this world
Holds nothing, but you have changed my way
Now I see everything
You have changed my way
You are everything
We were sitting in the car with the radio...
We were sitting in the car with the radio...

[Chorus]
We were sitting in the car with the radio on
We were at a red light, I looked at you and saw
You in the light, never seen such life
As we slowly took a left, it never felt so rightYou might also like6Embed SittingInTheCar SittingInTheCar surrenderdorothy emo
