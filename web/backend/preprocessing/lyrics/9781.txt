29 ContributorsAgain Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sweet like water weh dey inside coconut
Sip after sip you give me stamina
Wait for you so the same time we commot
Me and you na the same time
I never want to leave omo
So dance with me omo
I pull up on your beach omo
It's time to swim omo

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby girl make you no dey lie
Make you tell your friends say you dey feel this guy
No need to waste time cos na me you go follow till the day we die
But meanwhile, I can’t wait make your face just smile
It’s not a lie, you set my soul on fire

[Chorus]
So many girls have passed through, none of the girls fine pass you
So many things you’ve been through
Promise life wouldn’t be the same again oh
Wouldn’t be the same again, would never be the same again
Would never be the same again, never be the same again

[Bridge]
No mind them dem dey lie to you
Dem talk say me I too bad for you
No mind them dem dey lie to you
Dem talk say me I too bad for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby girl make you no dey lie
Make you tell your friends say you dey feel this guy
No need to waste time cos na me you go follow till the day we die
But meanwhile, I can’t wait make your face just smile
It’s not a lie, you set my soul on fire

[Chorus]
So many girls have passed through, none of the girls fine pass you
So many things you’ve been through
Promise life wouldn’t be the same again oh
Wouldn’t be the same again, would never be the same again
Would never be the same again, never be the same again2Embed Again Realms Wande Coal dancehall
