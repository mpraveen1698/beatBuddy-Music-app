8 ContributorsIn Your Arms (For An Angel) Lyrics[Verse 1: Nico Santos]
My heart was way too lonely
If you saw it closely, you'll see the scars, oh yeah
But all the things you showed me
Make me feel so holy, that's what you are

[Pre-Chorus: Nico Santos]
And I feel it comin', your mind, my mind
Everything that we're doin'
Feels right, oh, I
Love the way that you're movin'
You're my limelight
I don't wanna lose you right now
Lose you right now

[Chorus: Nico Santos]
Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms
Don't let go, no, just hold me again
Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms
'Cause you know I feel home on your skin
Take me in your arms

[Post-Chorus: Nico Santos]
Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms

And I feel it comin', your mind, my mind
Everything that we're doin'

Love the way that you're movin'
You're my limelight
I don't wanna lose you right now
