13 ContributorsOulala Lyrics[Verse 1]
Homeliness and loneliness are wearing at the scars
Rehash information so to tell them who you are
Definition blurs when you're staring through the smoke
Nothing really hurts when everything's a joke

[Chorus]
I want to give it to you, I want to show you some
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
I want to give it to you, I want to show you some
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
Ououlalala
Ououou

[Verse 2]
Smart enough to make it, dumb enough to use it
Dropping to the floor when all the girlies lose it
He don't really like the taste so he cover it in salt
Taste that shit so much he don't notice it at all

[Chorus]
I want to give it to you, I want to show you some
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
I want to give it to you, I want to show you some
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
Ououlalala
Ououou...

She fade away, eight shades a day
Didn't you want it? I know you want it
Didn't you want it? I know you want it
I fake a laugh, sick psychopath
Didn't you want it? I know you want it
Didn't you want it? I know you want it
She fade away, eight shades of grey
Didn't you want it? I know you want it
Didn't you want it? I know you want it
I fake a laugh, sick psychopath
Didn't you want it? I know you want it
Didn't you want it? I know you want it
Didn't you want it? I know you want it
Didn't you want it? I know you want it

[Outro]
I want to give it to you, I want to show you some

I want to give it to you, I want to show you some
