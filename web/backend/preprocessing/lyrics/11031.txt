5 ContributorsBe Your Everything Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Four letter word
But I don't have the guts to say it
Smile 'til it hurts
Let's not make it complicated
We've got a story
But I'm about to change the ending
You're perfect for me
And more than just a friend
So we can just stop pretending now?
I gotta let you know somehow

[Chorus]
I'll be your shelter
I'll be your storm
I'll make you shiver
I'll keep you warm
Whatever weather
Baby, I'm yours
Be your forever, be your fling
Baby, I will be your everything
Baby I
Baby, I will
Baby, I will be your everything

We used to say
That we would always stick together
But who's to say
That we could never last forever
Girl, got a question
Could you see yourself with somebody else?
'Cause I'm on a mission
And I don't wanna share, I want you all to myself right now
I just wanna scream it out

[Chorus]
I'll be your shelter
I'll be your storm
I'll make you shiver
I'll keep you warm
Whatever weather
Baby, I'm yours
Be your forever, be your fling
Baby, I will be your everything
Baby, I
Baby, I will
Baby, I will be your everything

[Bridge]
No matter what you do, yeah
Well, I'll be there for you
And every time you close your eyes
I will be by your side
'Cause every time you make me sing
Baby, I will be your everything
[Chorus]
I'll be your shelter
I'll be your storm
But I'll make you shiver
I'll keep you warm
Whatever weather
Baby, I'm yours
Be your forever, be your fling
Baby, I will be your everything
Baby, I
Baby, I will
Baby, I will be your everything

[Outro]
Baby, I
Baby, I will (I'll be your storm)
Baby, I will be your everything
Baby, I (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, I will
