5 ContributorsI Love You Will Still Sound the Same Lyrics[Verse 1]
Could you see yourself
Growing old with me
Watching my head turn to grey?
Could you live with me
In my mistakes
And the ones I have yet to make?

[Chorus]
So when our eyes have seen their better days
And our hearing starts to fade
Put your arms 'round my neck, and your heart on my chest
"I love you" will still sound the same
"I love you" will still sound the same
Hey yeah ey ey yeah ey ey
Hey yeah ey ey yeah
Hey yeah ey ey yeah ey ey
"I love you" will still sound the same
"I love you" will still sound the same

[Verse 2]
I can see our dreams
Inside of a child
Long after ours fade away
When our rings start to rust
And our skin starts to age
Remember the promise we made
You might also like[Chorus]
So when our eyes have seen their better days
And our hearing starts to fade
Put your arms 'round my neck, and your heart on my chest
"I love you" will still sound the same
"I love you" will still sound the same
Hey yeah ey ey yeah ey ey
Hey yeah ey ey yeah
Hey yeah ey ey yeah ey ey
"I love you" will still sound the same
"I love you" will still sound the same

[Bridge]
When bills pile up
And times test our love
We’ll say forever ain’t enough
We’ll stick to our guns
Our grip won’t loosen up
When we say forever ain’t enough

[Chorus]
So when our eyes have seen their better days
And our hearing starts to fade
Put your arms 'round my neck, and your heart on my chest
"I love you" will still sound the same
"I love you" will still sound the same
Hey yeah ey ey yeah ey ey
Hey yeah ey ey yeah
Hey yeah ey ey yeah ey ey
"I love you" will still sound the same
"I love you" will still sound the same3Embed I Love You Will Still Sound The Same With Love - EP Oh Honey r-n-b
