3 ContributorsOnly For The Better Lyrics[Verse 1]
I thought you’d stick around
So maybe I could see your face in town
You moved to New York City
Now I’m the one who never sleeps
Wonder if you’re busy
Or do you ever think of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Was staring in your eyes
But now I’m staring at the ceiling
It’s crazy how the time can fly
I’m tryna shake this feeling
I’ve been moving on
Sure, I miss you but whatever
You’re already gone, you look happier than ever

[Chorus]
For a minute, I’d admit it, I thought you could be the one
But you’re moving on, I guess it’s only for the better

[Post-Chorus/Drop]

I guess it’s only for thе better
B-b-better
B-b-better
B-b-better
I guess it’s only for the better

Better off alone
At least that’s what I tell myself, you know
Now I’m stuck in this damn city
Where the winters never end
And I wish that you were with me
But I guess I’ll just pretend

Was staring in your eyes
But now I’m staring at the ceiling
It’s crazy how the time can fly
I’m tryna shake this feeling
I’ve been moving on
Sure, I miss you but whatever
You’re already gone, you look happier than ever

[Chorus]
For a minute, I’d admit it, I thought you could be the one
But you’re moving on, I guess it’s only for the better

[Post-Chorus/Drop]

I guess it’s only for the better

I guess it’s only for the better
[Chorus/Outro]
For a minute, I’d admit it, I thought you could be the one
But you’re moving on, I guess it’s only for the betterEmbed Only For The Better Only For The Better John De Sohn;Ericka Jane progressive-house
