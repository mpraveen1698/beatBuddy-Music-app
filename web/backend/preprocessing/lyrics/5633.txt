We all have a weakness
But some of ours are easy to identify
Look me in the eye
And ask for forgiveness
We'll make a pact to never speak that word again
Yes, you are my friend

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We all have something that digs at us
At least we dig each other (Ah ah, ah ah)
So when weakness turns my ego up
I know you'll count on the me from yesterday (Yesterday)

[Chorus]
If I turn into another
Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me
Sing this song
Remind me that we'll always have each other
When everything else is gone, oh oh

[Verse 2]
We all have a sickness
That cleverly attaches and multiplies
No matter how we try

We all have someone that digs at us
At least we dig each other
Ah ah, oh oh
So when sickness turns my ego up
I know you'll act as a clever medicine

[Chorus]
If I turn into another
Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me
Sing this song (Sing this song)
Remind me that we'll always have each other
When everything else is gone
Oh, each other
When everything else is gone

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
If I turn into another
Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me
Sing this song (Sing this song)
Remind me that we'll always have each other
When everything else is gone
[Outro]
Oh, each other (Sing this song)
When everything else is gone
Oh, each other
When everything else is gone9Embed Dig Light Grenades Incubus grunge
