10 ContributorsYOU AGAINST YOURSELF Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know you feel it, but you'd always rather bottle it up
I'm rootin' for you, but you're not even tryin'
I wanna help you, but it's hard to get through all of your walls
I hope you know that I'm rootin' for ya

[Pre-Chorus]
You made all this conflict
Brought it upon yourself
Is this what you wanted?
I can't even tell

[Chorus]
Stuck in the thick of it (Ooh)
God, aren't you sick of it by now?
Not just a little bit (Ooh)
It's always you against your—
Selfish ways are suffocatin'
I can't save you now
Oh, why's it always you against yourself?

[Verse 2]
You're on the other side of everything that anyone says
So defensive and it's you that it's hurtin'
I wanna help you, but I can't so I'm walkin' away
I'm rootin' for ya, still rootin' for ya
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I could be honest
Wish you'd understand
We don't talk very often
You're lost in your head

[Chorus]
Stuck in the thick of it (Ooh)
God, aren't you sick of it by now?
Not just a littlе bit (Ooh)
It's always you against your—
Selfish ways are suffocatin'
I can't save you now
Oh, why's it always you against yoursеlf?

[Bridge]
You're goin' out almost every night
And you wonder why you feel fucked up
Said you wanna try to live a better life
Until you realize nothing's enough
You're goin' out almost every night
And you wonder why you feel fucked up
Said you wanna try to live a better life
Until you realize nothing's enough

[Chorus]
Stuck in the thick of it (Ooh)
God, aren't you sick of it by now?
Not just a little bit (Ooh)
It's always you against your—
Selfish ways are suffocatin'
I can't save you now
Oh, why's it always you against yourself?4Embed YOU AGAINST YOURSELF YOU AGAINST YOURSELF Ruel alternative
