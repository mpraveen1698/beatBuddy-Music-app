Special (Check my melody, my melody)
[Verse 1]
You think you're special, you do
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it when you laugh at me
Look down on me and walk around on me

[Verse 2]
Just one more fight about your leadership
And I will straight up leave your shit
'Cause I've had enough of this
And now I'm pissed, yeah!

[Chorus]
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway
