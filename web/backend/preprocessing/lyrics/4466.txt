20 ContributorsYam Yam Lyrics[Verse 1]
Why don't you take off your red shoes
So we can end our night well spent?
And why don't you say what's on your mind?
I won't run away

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't turn away, won't turn away, won't turn away
I won't turn away, won't turn away, won't turn away

[Chorus]
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay

[Verse 2]
Staring at a distance, this warmth is hard to find
Sitting in the silence, I gave my best; I tried
Simply a distraction I didn't hope to find
Sitting by my side, I hope you're here to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't turn away, won't turn away, won't turn away
I won't turn away, won't turn away, won't turn away

When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay20Embed Yam Yam Yam Yam No Vacation garage
