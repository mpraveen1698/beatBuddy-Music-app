6 ContributorsIllusions (Harpsichord mix) LyricsVerse 1 (B-Real):
Some people tell me that I need help
Some people can fuck off and go to hell
Goddamn why they criticize me
Now shit is on the rise so my family despise me
Fuck 'em and feed 'em
'Cause I don't need 'em
I won't join 'em if I can't beat 'em
They don't understand my logic
To my gat to my money and I'm hooked on chronic
I never wanted to hurt a nigga
Unless you come flexin' that trigger, I'll dig ya
That grave on the Eastside of town
Lay ya six feet underground
From man to the dust to the ashes
All I remember tell me where the cash is
Click clack barrel at my dome
Give all your loot or you ain't goin' home
But I ain't goin' out with a bang
Wadada dang, wadadada dang dang
Chorus (B-Real):
I'm having illusions
All this confusions drivin' me mad inside
I'm having illusions
All this confusions fuckin' me up in my mind
I'm having illusions
All this confusions drivin' me mad inside
I'm having illusions
All this confusions fuckin' me up in my mind

Motherfuckers be drivin' me up the walls
Hopin' that I fall but they can lick my balls
Straight jacket, strap it
In the padded room where some punk zaggin can't hack it
Distracted from all reality
Now I'm let out on a minor technicality
Ahhh, they all fucked up now
'Cause they let a nigga back on the street some how
I'm lookin' for someone like me
Livin' in my own world to my own degree
On the loose in the city
Lookin' at the hoe with the big titties lookin' at me
And I feel shitty, a little tensed up
Gettin' hot 'cause she looks like my girl
Who got smoked at the crack spot
I'm tryin' to find ways to cope
But I ain't fucking 'round with the gauge or a rope

Chorus (B-Real):
I'm having illusions
All this confusions drivin' me mad inside
I'm having illusions
All this confusions fuckin' me up in my mind
I'm having illusions
All this confusions drivin' me mad inside
I'm having illusions
All this confusions fuckin' me up in my mind
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions1Embed Illusions - Harpsichord Mix Stash Cypress Hill hardcore
