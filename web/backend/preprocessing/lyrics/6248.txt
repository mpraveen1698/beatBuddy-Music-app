4 Contributors​the same Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love and life
Beauty couldn't even begin to describe
Young and wise
Don't know who I'd be without you by my side

[Chorus]
You were my everything
'Til the daylight died
I may change
But I'll never love anyone the same

[Verse 2]
Give, take away
You are the hand that feeds me
Live every day with joy
Like we're on vacation
We're on our own vacation

[Chorus]
You were my everything
'Til the daylight diеd
I may change
But I'll never lovе anyone the same

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
You might also like[Chorus]
You were my everything
'Til the daylight died
I may change
But I'll never love anyone the same

[Outro]
Never be the same
Never love again
Never be the same1Embed the same SKY ON FIRE mehro songwriter
