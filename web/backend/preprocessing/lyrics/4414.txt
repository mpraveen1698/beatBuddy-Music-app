6 Contributorsâ€‹never knew a heart could break itself Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're gettin' used to
Sleepin' in an empty bed
I'm gettin' used to the pain
Your blue tiger tattoo
I can't get it out my head
I don't really want it to fade

[Pre-Chorus]
Something went wrong and we tried so hard to fix it
Couldn't hold on, so we blamed it on the distance
And now I'm in hell
I never knew a heart could break itself

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy
But I miss you madly
Don't hold it against me
But I'm not even close to
Lettin' you go yet
Reality's frozen
'Cause I can't take the photos of us off the shelf
I never knew a heart could break itself

[Verse 2]
I still miss your mama
I really hope she's doin' well
I feel like I lost a family
So, farewell to Oklahoma
Thanks for holdin' onto me
The way I'm holdin' onto all these memories

Something went wrong and we tried so hard to fix it
Couldn't hold on, so we blamed it on the distance
And now I'm in hell
I never knew a heart could break itself

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy
But I miss you madly
Don't hold it against me
But I'm not even close to
Lettin' you go yet
Reality's frozen
'Cause I can't take the photos of us off the shelf
I never knew a heart could break itself
No, I never knew a heart could break itself2Embed never knew a heart could break itself never knew a heart could break itself Zach Hood singer-songwriter
