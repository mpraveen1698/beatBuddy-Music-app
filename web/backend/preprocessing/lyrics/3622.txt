No, sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat, we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why?
All the possibilities, well, I was wrong

[Chorus]
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
'Cause I burned
Every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try
Holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities, I'm sure you've heard
You might also like[Chorus]
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating (Beating)
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so (So) inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey

[Refrain: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams, Josh Farro, Zac Farro, Jeremy Davis & Steve Smith]
Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh

[Chorus]
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Now I can't trust myself with anything but this
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
