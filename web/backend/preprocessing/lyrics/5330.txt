7 ContributorsFlying :)) Lyrics[Verse 1]
And I'm coming home
London in the rain
Driving real slow in the fast lane
Feelin' kinda stressed
Tryin' to get drunk
Problem with the rich kids is that they're no fun

[Chorus]
Right now I'm flying
So come and take a shot at me
Not scared of dying
It's sad how sad this life can be

[Verse 2]
Driving through the clouds
Picking all the bad ones out the crowd
Had a bad month
Had a bad year
Had a bad time getting over my fears

[Chorus]
Right now I'm flying
So come and take a shot at me
Not scared of dying
It's sad howâ€“

I don't wanna talk about my problems
I don't wanna tell another lie
I don't wanna write another love song
I don't wanna even fucking try
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody

[Chorus]
Right now I'm flying
So come and take a shot at me
Not scared of dying
It's sad how sad this life can be1Embed Flying :)) Flying :)) Tom Odell chill
