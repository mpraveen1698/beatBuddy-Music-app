1 ContributorThe Way I Love You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nighttime and coffee
A table for two
Track fifteen sunsets
Got nothing on you
You stare at your phone, girl
I'll stare at it too
'Cause I've never loved somebody
The way I love you

[Chorus]
The way I love you, oh-oh, oh-oh
The way I love you
It's not fair how beautiful you are
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Green eyes and freckles
I feel so alive
We dance through the rain, yeah
You've seen me cry
And I always will love you
Through every storm
I've never loved somebody
The way I love you
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, the way I love you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, the way I love you
It's not fair how beautiful you are3Embed The Way I Love You The Way I Love You yaeow;Neptune sad
