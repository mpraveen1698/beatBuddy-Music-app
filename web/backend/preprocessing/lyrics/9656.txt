11 ContributorsEverything I Own Lyrics[Verse 1]
You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm
Kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free
You set me free

[Pre-Chorus]
Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you

[Chorus]
And I would give everything I own!
Give up me life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again!

[Verse 2]
You taught me how to cry
I don't know, why?
Just don't know, why?
You told those lies to me
You set me free
You set me free

Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you

[Chorus]
And I would give everything I own!
Give up me life
My heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you
Back again
Just to hold you
Once again!

[Bridge]
If there's someone you know
That won't let you go
And taking it all for granted
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And you don't hear a word they say

[Chorus]
I would give everything I own!
Give up my life
My heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you
Back again
Just to hold you
Once again!
[Outro]
I would give everything I own!
Give up my life
My heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you
Back again
Just to hold you once again
Once again!Embed Everything I Own Sold Boy George synth-pop
