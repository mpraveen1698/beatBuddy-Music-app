What's up with what's going down
In every city, in every town
Cramping styles is the plan
They've got us in the palm of every hand

[Chorus]
When we pretend that we're dead
When we pretend that we're dead
They can't hear a word we've said
When we pretend that we're dead

[Post-Chorus]
Come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on

[Verse 2]
Turn the tables with our unity
They're neither moral nor majority
Wake up and smell the coffee
Or just say no to individuality

[Chorus]
When we pretend that we're dead
(Pretend we're dead)
When we pretend that we're dead
(Pretend that we're dead)
They can't hear a word we've said
(Pretend we're dead)
When we pretend that we're dead

Come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on

[Chorus]
When we pretend that we're dead
(Pretend we're dead)
When we pretend that we're dead
(Pretend that we're dead)
They can't hear a word we've said
(Pretend we're dead)
When we pretend that we're dead

[Outro]
Dead, (come on come on come on come on)
Dead, (pretend we're dead)
Dead, (come on come on come on come on)
Dead, (pretend we're dead)
Dead, (come on come on come on come on)
Dead, (pretend we're dead)
Dead, (come on come on come on come on)
Dead, (pretend we're dead)
Dead, (come on come on come on come on)
Dead, (pretend we're dead)
Dead, (come on come on come on come on)
Dead, (pretend we're dead)
Dead, (come on come on come on come on)
Dead, (pretend we're dead)
Dead, (come on come on come on come on)
Dead, (pretend we're dead)5Embed Pretend We're Dead Bricks Are Heavy L7 grunge
