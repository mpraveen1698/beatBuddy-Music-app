(2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 1]
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new land
To fight the horde, and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 2]
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your ovеrlords
You might also like[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be thе western shore

[Verse 3]
So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing

[Outro]
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
La, la, la, la.......Embed The Immigrant Song - Alternate Mix Led Zeppelin III (Deluxe Edition) Led Zeppelin hard-rock
