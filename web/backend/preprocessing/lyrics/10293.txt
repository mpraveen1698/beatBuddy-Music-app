Time to listen to my confession
I'm much less than I wanted to be, wanted to be
You shine a light on my dark side, but you
Don't care what you see

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
Overjoyed. Over you. Overnight
But that's what you do

[Chorus 1:]
Why don't you lock me up with joy and kisses?
Lock me up with love?
Chain me to your heart's desire
I don't want you to stop
Lock me in and hold this moment, never get enough
Ain't no way I'm ever breaking free
Lock me up

(Oh, oh. [x3])
Lock me up

[Verse 2:]
Criticize
You don't analyse me cause
You can see what I'm trying to be, trying to be
I've been lost and I've been blinded by
All the things that I've seen
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2:]
Overjoyed. Over you. Overnight
Girl, that's what you do

[Chorus 2:]
So why don't you lock me up with joy and kisses?
Lock me up with love?
Chain me to your heart's desire
I don't want you to stop
Lock me in and hold this moment, never get enough
Ain't no way I'm ever breaking free
Lock me up

Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh
(Why don't ya? [x3] Lock me up.)
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh
(Why don't ya? [x3] Lock me up.)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
