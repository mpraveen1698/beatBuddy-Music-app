Do, do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do, do-do-do, do-do-do
(Do, do-do-do)

[Verse 1]
Simple things got complicated
No more friends and no more faces
Not what I anticipated
I want to be alleviated

Cut my cloth and clip my wings
Twist my arm and pull my strings
It goes back and forth and back to me
In my mind, I hear you sing, it goes

[Chorus]
Do, do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do, do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do

[Verse 2]
Nothing has been said or done
Of you and I or anyone
No progress can be ever made
No day will ever feel the same
