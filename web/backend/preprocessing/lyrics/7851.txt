Baby, make your move
Step across the line
Touch me one more time
Come on, dare me
I wanna take you on
I know I can't lose
And I'll be loving you
If you just let me

Baby, make your move
Step across the line
Touch me one more time
Come on, dare me
I wanna take you on
I know I can't lose
And I'll be loving you
If you just let me
Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me

[Chorus]
Baby, make your move
Step across the line
Baby, make your move

Baby, make your move
Step across the line
Touch me one more time
