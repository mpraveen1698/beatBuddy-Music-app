Feel I'm going back
To Massachusetts
Something's telling me
I must go home

[Chorus]
And the lights all went out down in Massachusetts
The day I left
Her standing on her own

[Verse 2]
Tried to hitch a ride
To San Francisco
Gotta do the things
I wanna do

[Chorus 2]
And the lights all went down in Massachusetts
They brought me back
To see my way with you

[Verse 3]
Talk about the life
In Massachusetts
Speak about the people
I have seen
You might also like[Chorus 3]
And the lights all went down in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts
Is one place I have seen

[Outro]
(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts
(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts
(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts3Embed Massachusetts Horizontal Bee Gees disco
