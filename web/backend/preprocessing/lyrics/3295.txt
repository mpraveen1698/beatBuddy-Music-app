Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
Her placenta falls to the floor
The angel opens her eyes,  the confusion sets in
Before the doctor can even close the door

[Verse 2]
Lightning crashes, an old mother dies
Her intentions fall to the floor
The angel closes her eyes, the confusion that was hers
Belongs now, to the baby down the hall

[Chorus]
Oh, now I feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it

[Verse 3]
Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
This moment she's been waiting for
The angel opens her eyes, pale blue colored iris
Presents the circle, puts the glory out to hide, hide

[Chorus]
Oh, now I feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it
I can feel it

Oh, why
Oh, why
Oh, why

[Chorus]
Oh, now I feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it

[Chorus]
I can feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it

[Chorus]
I can feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it

[Outro]
I can feel it
I can feel it14Embed Lightning Crashes Throwing Copper Live grunge
