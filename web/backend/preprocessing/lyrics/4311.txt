21 ContributorsBreak Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tonight, my head is spinning
I need something to pick me up
I’ve tried, but nothing is working
I won’t stop, I won’t say I’ve had enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight, I start the fire
Tonight, I break away

[Chorus]
Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way this place is
Take yourself to higher places

[Verse 2]
At night I feel like a vampire
It’s not right but I just can’t give it up
I’ll try to get myself higher
Let’s go, we’re going to light it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight, we start the fire
Tonight, we break away
You might also like[Chorus]
Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way this place is
Take yourself to higher places

[Bridge]
If you can’t stand the way this place is
Take (Take) yourself (Yourself) to higher places

[Chorus]
Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way this place is
Take yourself to higher places

[Outro]
Higher places
To higher places
Higher places
Take yourself to higher places11Embed Break Life Starts Now Three Days Grace grunge
