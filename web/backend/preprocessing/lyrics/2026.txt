When I was young and stupid, my love
Left to be a rock and roll star
He told me, "Please, don't worry"
Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a one-way ticket
Out west, that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches

[Verse 2]
He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewellery​
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion

[Chorus]
Bye-bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost

Where I was from in NOLA, no one
Left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him, don't you blame me?
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust, he's
Chasing that pappy pipe dream

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh)
I know you don't, but I—
I know you don't, but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone, but I—
That girl is gone, but I still try
I think it's over now
The bullet hit, but maybe not
I feel so fucking numb
It hits my head and I feel numb
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong
[Chorus]
Bye-bye, baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost53Embed The Other Side Of Paradise How To Be A Human Being Glass Animals indie
