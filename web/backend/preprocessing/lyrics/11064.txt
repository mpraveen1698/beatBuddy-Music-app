1 ContributorMake You Feel Like LyricsHow can I be dreaming of tomorrow and living for today?
How can I be laying here beside you, begging you to stay?
When the moon lights up the sky, takes the sun to make it right
You're the soul and life for me
I don’t forget the hurt and shame, back and forth so many times again
Will the love replace the pain?

I'll make you feel like (huuhuu)
I'll make you feel like (huuhuu-u-huu)
I’ll make you feel like (huuhuu)
I'll make you feel like (huuhuu-u-huu)

How can I be living without the sorrow?
You don't really want to stay
How can I? I wanna take you with me
Love you evеryday
Like every night has it's dawn, all thе darkness will be gone
And our love will light the day
Without you here there's no use, got no time left to lose
There's no more I can say

I'll make you feel like (huuhuu)
I'll make you feel like (huuhuu-u-huu)
I’ll make you feel like (huuhuu)
I’ll make you feel like (huuhuu-u-huu)
You might also likeUhh, I'll take you with me
Love you everyday

Make you feel
Make you feel like

I’ll make you feel like (huuhuu)
I'll make you feel like
I'll make you feel like (huuhuu)
I'll make you feel like (huuhuu-u-huu)

Make you feel like
