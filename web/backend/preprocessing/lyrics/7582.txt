25 ContributorsStitch Lyrics[Intro/Chorus]
Leave me in the dark with a hole for a heart
As low as I can get, burn the bridge, rip the stitch out
Pick it up!

[Verse 1]
I can't pretend like it's all part of the plan
I can't hide it, blindsided
I can't fight it, it's more than I can stand
Broken
But I guess you knew that it would be this way
Loose ends
Tie the knot and wait for your chance to run away
I could never make you stay, you'll run away
I'll always be your greatest mistake, so run away
Just another game that you played, you'll run away
Three years in the making
But I guess we weren't worth saving

We weren't worth saving

[Chorus]
Leave me in the dark with a hole for a heart
As low as I can get, burn the bridge, rip the stitch out
Guess I'll play dead
It's all in my head
To you I don't exist
Call it bliss
Rip the stitch out

Bitter to the core
Always want more
Take what you can get
But I'll bet that it's never enough
Is it?
Pull the knife out of my back
Let it all fade to black
Made it so clear
I think we're done here
Bitter to the core
Always want more
Take what you can get
But I'll bet that it's never enough
Is it?
Pull the knife out of my back
Let it all fade to black
Made it so clear
I think we're done here

[Chorus]
Leave me in the dark with a hole for a heart
As low as I can get, burn the bridge, rip the stitch out
Guess I'll play dead
It's all in my head
To you I don't exist
Call it bliss
Rip the stitch out
Leave me in the dark with a hole for a heart
As low as I can get, burn the bridge, rip the stitch out
Guess I'll play dead
It's all in my head
To you I don't exist
Call it bliss
Rip the stitch out
[Breakdown]
You were the light I could never see in myself
I would've stood by you until the gates of hell10Embed Stitch Deadweight Wage War metalcore
