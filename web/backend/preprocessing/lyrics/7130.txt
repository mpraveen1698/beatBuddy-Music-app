1 ContributorOcean Quiet LyricsHello, dear
Hello, friend
Did you taste the summer wind?
Hello, dear
Hello, love
Did the sun dry your skin?

All I see is those blue skies
Yeah, the same who got us high
Mmm
When we had our prime

Are your money running out?
Hope you made it well down south
Mmm
Don't worry, you'll be fine

A sunny summer day
You and me we stayed out late you
You were my bonfire
Kept me warm, you kept me sane
Always laughing through the days, but
Now it's ocеan quiet
Now it's ocean quiet

Hеllo, you
Are you okay?
Did you leave or did you stay?
Do you still wander around
Did you find your place
Or are you shifting towns?

Are your money running out?
Hope you made it well down south

Don't worry, you'll be fine

A sunny summer day
You and me we stayed out late you
You were my bonfire
Kept me warm you kept me sane
Always laughing through the days, but
Now it's ocean quiet
Now it's ocean quiet

Ocean quiet
Ocean quiet
Now it's ocean quiet
Ocean quiet
Ocean quiet
