2 ContributorsFirst You Jump Lyrics[Verse 1]
And if the world stops spinning there'd be no sign
No future love, only days behind
I'd call on you
No matter what you put me through
And if the skies above turn to crimson red
Hear the memories, all you said
I'd call on you
No matter what you put me through

[Chorus]
First you jump then get wings
Escaping all that hurts you
The traumas that they put you through
First you fall then fly in
You're taking in the new view
Becoming all you're meant to

[Verse 2]
And if the world stops spinning there'd be no end
Every twist, every turn, back again
I'd call on you
No matter what you put me through
At first you jump into a world that's free
Where all that's Heaven-sent is now reality
I'd call on you
The only one that pulls me through

First you jump then get wings
Forgetting all the voices
Silence deep in your head
You won't give up now soaring
Heading for the clear view
No more worry haunts you

[Bridge]
And if the world stops spinning
And if the world stops spinning
And if the world stops

[Chorus]
First you jump then get wings
Escaping all that hurts you
The traumas that they put you through
First you fall then fly in
You're taking in the new view
Becoming all you're meant toEmbed Turn Turn Crimson Memoirs piano
