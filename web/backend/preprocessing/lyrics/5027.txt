Out on the streets, I'm stalking the night
I can hear my heavy breathing
Paid for the kill, but it doesn't seem right
Something there I can't believe in

[Pre-Chorus]
Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them, I can hear them
Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now

[Chorus]
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you, alright

[Verse 2]
Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reasons
I wouldn't listen, I learned how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason

[Pre-Chorus]
But just like the wounded, and when it's too late
They'll remember, they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now
You might also like[Chorus]
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Nothing that you can do
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you, alright

[Pre-Chorus]
But just like the wounded, and when it's too late
They'll remember, they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

[Chorus]
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Nothing that you can do
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you, alright

[Outro]
Just a shot in the dark
Just a shot in the dark
Just a shot in the dark
Just a shot in the dark5Embed Shot in the Dark The Ultimate Sin Ozzy Osbourne hard-rock
