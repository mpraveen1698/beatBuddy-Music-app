When the end begins
I know that I'll
See you again
Eternity, eternity yeah
Would you meet me there?

[Pre-Drop]
Would you meet me there?
Would you meet me there?

[Drop]
See you again
(Would you meet me there?)

[Verse]
There is no way back
I know our time's
Not over yet
Eternity, eternity yeah
Would you meet me there?
Would you meet me there?

[Pre-Drop]
Would you meet me there?
