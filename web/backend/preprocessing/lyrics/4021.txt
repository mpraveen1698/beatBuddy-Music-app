I know you think I got it all figured out 'cause
I walk around like my head’s in the clouds but
I’m just a boy with his heart pourin' out
Of his head
I wish that you could see the pain that I’ve seen and
All of the times I spent being not me and
I hope you know that it’s not always happy
In my head

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't know
The perfect road to go down
But I know

[Chorus]
I'm trying my best
I'm trying my best to be okay
I'm trying my best but every day
It's so hard
And I'm holding my breath
I'm holding my breath til’ I can say
All of the words I want to say
From my heart

[Verse 2]
If you really wanted I could let you inside
It’s been so long and I’ve got nothing left to hide
Would you believe me if I told you that I’ve
Got flaws
Now it’s time to let the curtains unfold and
Tell all the stories that I didn’t want told yeah
Let it out so I unburden my soul
I won't stop

I'm trying my best but every day
It's so hard
And I'm holding my breath
