11 ContributorsSunset/Sunrise Lyrics[Verse]
You say that you love me
Do you really mean that?
I'm not sure but I think you do
I say that love you
Do I really mean that?
I'm not sure but I think I do
All we do is fight fight fight
'Till the night time time
And I'm sick and tired of it
All you do is win, wine wine
While I sigh sigh sigh
And we're sick and tired of it
But we both stay till the sunrise
Cause we'll never leave each other side‚ no

[Chorus]
No no‚ nah nah
No no‚ nah nah
No no, nah nah
No no, nah nahYou might also like3Embed Sunset/Sunrise Sunset/Sunrise Snøw sad
