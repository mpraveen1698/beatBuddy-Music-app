3 ContributorsWho Do You Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Should've known it, should've seen it
It was screamin' all this time
I was a loner, rolling stone
I couldn't see you in that light
You were hiding, now it's blinding
Like a lightning in my sky
And I have been waitin' all this time

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Who do you love?
Come on and tell me
Who do you love?
And if you're askin'
Who am I thinkin' of
Who do I love
It's you
Who do you love?
Who's got you dreamin'
When you wake up
And after all is said and done
Who's the one
Who do I love?
It's you
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
It's you
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Said and done
Who's the one?
Who do I love?
It's you, it's you

[Verse 2]
Took a moment, 'til I knew it
Didn't lose you just in time, mmm
Had some fun, out on the run
But baby you're my finish line
Hey what a feelin', what a reason
To believe in being alive
And I have been waitin' all this time

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Who do you love?
Come on and tell me
Who do you love?
And if you're askin'
Who am I thinkin' of
Who do I love
It's you
Who do you love?
Who's got you dreamin'
When you wake up
And after all is said and done
Who's the one
Who do I love?
It's you, it's you, it's you
It's you
Hey, hey, hey
Who do you love?
Come on and tell me
Who do you love?
And if you're askin'
Who am I thinkin' of
Who do I love
It's you
Who do you love?
Who's got you dreamin'
When you wake up
And after all is said and done
Who's the one
Who do I love?
It's you, it's you, it's you1Embed Who Do You Love Who Do You Love ARTY;Rozzi progressive-house
