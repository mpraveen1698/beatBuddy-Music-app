19 ContributorsBurden in My Hand Lyrics[Verse 1]
Follow me into the desert, as thirsty as you are
Crack a smile and cut your mouth and drown in alcohol
'Cause down below the truth is lying beneath the riverbed
So quench yourself and drink the water that flows below her head

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, there she goes
Out in the sunshine
The sun is mine, the sun is mine

[Chorus]
I shot my love today, would you cry for me?
I lost my head again, would you lie for me?

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and bow your head, I need a little sympathy
'Cause fear is strong, and love's for everyone who isn't me
Kill your health and kill yourself and kill everything you love
And if you live, you can fall to pieces and suffer with my ghost

[Chorus]
I shot my love today, would you cry for me?
I lost my head again, would you lie for me?
I left her in the sand, just a burden in my hand
I lost my head again, would you cry for me?
You might also like[Bridge]
It's just a burden in my hand
It's just an anchor on my heart
It's just a tumor in my head
And I'm in the dark

[Verse 3]
So follow me into the desert, as desperate as you are
Where the moon is glued to a picture of heaven, and all the little pigs have God

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, there she goes
Out in the sunshine
The sun is mine, the sun is mine

[Chorus]
I shot my love today, would you cry for me, yeah?
I lost my head again, would you lie for me?
I left her in the sand, just a burden in my hand
I lost my head again, would you cry for me?
Yeah, would you cry for me?9Embed Burden In My Hand Down On The Upside Soundgarden grunge
