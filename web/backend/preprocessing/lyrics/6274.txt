11 ContributorsThe Author Lyrics[Verse 1]
Someone tell the author
What I really think of her
'Cause I'm afraid that all my unprecedented thoughts
Won't lead anywhere
I've stood in acquiescence
For too long in our friendship
I question the expense
Of saying what I've penned
What if my narrative would bring us to the end?

[Chorus]
Well, I don't wanna stay here
I wanna be in your arms by the sea
Studying your freckles curiously
Focused on your eyes so delicately
I just wanna stay outside till 6am
Even though I hated it then
I've only gone and stumbled into a dream
But will I ever be the one that you see while falling asleep?
While falling asleep

[Verse 2]
Are you caught in self reflection?
Or fighting the intention to follow what is told?
Are you afraid of living life in bold?
How else do you plan on emphasising what they wrote?
You might also like[Chorus]
So, I don't wanna stay here
I wanna be in your arms by the sea
Studying your freckles curiously
Focused on your eyes so delicately
I just wanna stay outside till 6am
Even though I hated it then
I've only gone and stumbled into a dream
But will I ever be the one that you see while falling asleep?
Oh no no, while falling asleep

[Bridge]
When unfamiliar faces
Tell you where your place is
I promise I'll be patient
With you and all your
Hyperbolic statements
I'll always be waiting
Waiting

[Chorus]
I don't wanna stay here
I wanna be in your arms by the sea
Studying your freckles curiously
Focused on your eyes so delicately
I just wanna stay outside till 6am
Even though I hated it then
I've only gone and stumbled into a dream
But will I ever be the one that you see while falling asleep?
No oh oh, while falling asleep, no oh oh oh2Embed the author the author Luz songwriter
