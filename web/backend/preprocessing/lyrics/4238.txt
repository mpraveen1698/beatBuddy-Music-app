Consider this an invitation, to my gangsta nation

[Refrain: Nate Dogg & Ice Cube]
Na na na na na na na na (Westside)

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they'll run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck?

[Verse 1: W.C.]
Nigga, I'm tired of these niggas barkin' that shit, talkin' that shit
From the concrete but ain't chalkin' that shit
In videos in a bitch pose and a throw back
Holdin' a gat, ain't gonna bust and know that
It's a Dub-S-C thang, W.C. brain
And we don't fuck with niggas in khaki g-strings
Fuck movin', I'm clearin the crowd
It's that hoo-bangin' ban-dana cri-mi-ni-mi-nal, the ori-gi-nal

Evacuate the building, bitch, here come a plane
No, it's the mad ass Westside Connect Gang
And fuck what you claim, nigga, this who bang
With enough game to drive a square bitch insane
And we number one gunners, no, we ain't stunners
It's real with us homey, killers and drug runners
And Mack be the D-boy in a H2 Hummer
Lookin' hotter than a muthafuckin' L.A. summer, let's go

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers, I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they'd run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck?

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
What the fuck is Ice Cube talkin' about?
That's how you get these nuts parked in you mouth
Westside ride bitch, the same old shit
I don't conversate with pussy, I ain't gon get
I don't holla at these hoes that sing like Ashanti
Body like Beyonce, face like Andre (Uhh)
Bitch you kinda strangé
But I'm rich so my entré
Got to be bombay
[Verse 4: W.C.]
Have you seen us? Nah
Haters can't see us
Connect Gang we the G'est, nigga
Countless calls and countless charges
Street niggas makin' blunts out of Cuban cigars
Big by the linnas hyp-notic by the liters
With a flank of hoes on us cause the chronic is the greenest
And to my niggas incarcerated and on probation
I'mma stay bangin' for the whole G Nation, nigga

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This game right here is rough as fuck

I have no fear, afraid of what

We still right here so what the fuck?

[Verse 5: Mack 10]
It's a Gangsta Nation, if you in, you a G
And the whole world influence by the B and the C
Now, tell the truth rappers, you don't ball like me
'Cause I'm really from the gang, y'all is industry
And while I'm servin' up and comin' young hustlas and cluckas
Bangin' for the hood, causin' havoc and ruckus
You niggas at the label, kissin' ass like suckas
And you're bitches, so sit down when you piss, motherfuckas
[Verse 6: Ice Cube]
One thing I do know, I ain't the uno
Big puno, rap sumo, on pruno (You know)
I'd like to thank the congregation
And my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation
I'm hard on them, yeah, I'm ruthless
You like a stick, pussy, nigga, you're useless
You know the side bitch, better get up on it
Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin' on it

[Bridge: Mack 10]
Look here man
Check this shit out man look
Ya'll might as well say: "Fuck it and join this Westside thing, man"
Cause we got a muthafucking Gangsta Nation goin' over here
And once you join this shit you as G as can motherfucking be!
Believe that, homie
Look, it ain't a hit til Nate Dogg spit

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers, I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they'd run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck?
