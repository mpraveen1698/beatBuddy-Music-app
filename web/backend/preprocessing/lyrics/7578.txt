Dear diary, I don't know what's going on, but something's up
The dog won't stop barking and I think my TV is bust
Every channel is the same, it's sending me insane
And earlier, somebody bit me, what a fucking day

[Chorus]
The sky is falling, it's fucking boring
I'm going braindead, isolated
God is a shithead and we're his rejects
Traumatised for breakfast
I can't stomach anymore Survival Horror
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Dear diary, I feel itchy like there's bugs under my skin
The dog's gone rabid (Shut the fuck up!) doing my head in
I keep fading in and out, I don't know where I've been
I feel so hungry, what the hell is happening?

[Chorus]
The sky is falling, it's fucking boring
I'm going braindead, isolatеd
God is a shithead and we're his rеjects
Traumatised for breakfast
I can't stomach anymore Survival Horror

Dear diary, dog stopped barking, probably 'cause I ate his face
"Tasty, itchy," TV say there's no more human race
Kinda sad my whole entire existence been a waste
Ah, never mind, it's not the end of the world, oh, wait

[Outro]
