Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you

[Verse 1]
It's so cold in the air, put the bud in my ear, first note start
I can see where you are, dream where you are
Will the song never end?
Us on the bed half a meter apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Awkward hearts beating faster and faster, faster and faster
We'll cut through the park, stick to the path
I can't stick to the path, 'cause I dream about nothing but you

[Chorus]
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, nothing but you, nothing but you

[Verse 2]
I may not say it outwardly
So all I have are memories
Those looks at the start, the words in the dark
But never a flame, we just wanted the spark

Awkward hearts beating faster and faster, faster and faster
We'll cut through the park, stick to the path
I can't stick to the path, 'cause I dream about nothing but you

[Chorus]
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Nothing but you
Nothing but you

[Outro]
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, nothing but you, nothing but you, nothing but you3Embed Eat, Sleep, Wake (Nothing But You) Everything Else Has Gone Wrong Bombay Bicycle Club british
