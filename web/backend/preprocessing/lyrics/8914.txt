Fuse ODG and S Peezy
What we tell dem? Blaze dem!

[Chorus: Fuse ODG]
Look at you in that dress
Girl you dangerous like a gun
Give them you, nothing less

Give them you, nothing less
Girl you murder everyone

[Verse 1: Fuse ODG]
Somebody call the popo, popo
'Cause the way that she is looking is so cold, so cold
If you ain’t ready then you need to go home
Everywhere, can see her rolling on the solo, solo
She got me begging oh no, oh no
And she all up on me like a logo, logo
But I’m not complaining, my baby let’s go go go
She kill them with the dance
She murder with her waist
Everybody watching when she turn up in the place
You ain’t got a chance if you really tryna race
She already at the finish line with her face
A shawty went down then she went low
Gave it to her better like she in a relay
The craziest thing is she don’t know
How beautiful she is everyday
