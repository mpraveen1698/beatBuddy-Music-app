Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
When the darkness don't let you sleep
I'mma hold you close
And when space is all you need
I can let you go
And if the spark in your eye goes out
I can be your glow
Bringing you home, yeah
Bringing you home

[Pre-Chorus]
I see your hurt, I feel your pain
All of our dirt is washed in the rain
I've walked that road, I've felt that shame
No place is home but times, they are changin'

[Chorus]
This is our sanctuary
We can find shelter and peace
This is our sanctuary
You are, you are safe with me
This is our sanctuary
We can find shelter and peace
This is our sanctuary
You are, you are safe with me

When the rain starts to take its toll
You can slow me down
'Cause we both know that the world's turned cold
And I just need you now
Keep holding on (Hold onto me, hold on)

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll see my hurt, you'll feel my pain
All of our dirt is washed in the rain
You've walked that road, you felt that shame
No place is home but times, they are changin'

[Chorus]
This is our sanctuary
We can find shelter and peace
This is our sanctuary
You are, you are safe with me
This is our sanctuary
We can find shelter and peace
This is our sanctuary
You are, you are safe with me (Yeah, yeah)
You are, you are safe with me (Yeah, yeah)

We share this hurt, we share the pain
All of our dirt is washed in the rain
We've walked that road, we've felt that shame
