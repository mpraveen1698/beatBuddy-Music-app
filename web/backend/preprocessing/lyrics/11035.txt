9 ContributorsJust Around the Corner LyricsThings aren't quite as they
Seem inside my domain

You can't know about everything
Only pleasure and pain
You wonder why I come here
With head to my hands

Where else can I be cured
And the king of your
Mansion?
A thorn in your side
A child to protect that
Claims he's free

Just around the corner
Half a mile to heaven

Strong enough to hold you
Starved for some affection
Darling
Come quickly
Come ease my mind

For my prayers have not been
Answered in a long time
You might also likeI've already made my bed
Like it or not

As long as there's no
Regrets I'll be here
When the ride stops
These comforts to me and
These crosses to bare
With which we live

Just around the corner
Half a mile to heaven

Strong enough to hold you
Starved for some affection
Baby
I can't drag you into this mess!

I'm the thorn in your side and
The child to protect
Just around the corner
Half a mile to heavenEmbed Just Around the Corner After Here Through Midland (Expanded Edition) Cock Robin synth-pop
