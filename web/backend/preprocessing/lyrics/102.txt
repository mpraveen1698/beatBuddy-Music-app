Don't remind me
I'm mindin' my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone than in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care?
If you really don't like me
Find somebody else, it could be anyone else out there

[Chorus: Oliver Tree]
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I nеver wanna meet you again
It'll happen again
I watch it happen ovеr and over again
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'
