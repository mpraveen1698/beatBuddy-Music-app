43 ContributorsJane Says Lyrics[Verse 1]
Jane says, "I'm done with Sergio
He treat me like a ragdoll"
She hides the television
Said, "I don't owe him nothin'
But if, oh, he come back again, tell him, wait right here for me
Or try again tomorrow

[Hook 1]
I'm gonna kick tomorrow
I'm gonna kick tomorrow"

[Verse 2]
Jane says, "Have you seen my wig around
I feel naked without it"
She knows they all want her to go
But that's okay, man, she don't like them anyway
Jane says, "I'm goin' away to Spain when I get my money saved
Gonna start tomorrow

[Hook 1]
I'm gonna kick tomorrow
I'm gonna kick tomorrow"

[Bridge]
Well, she get mad, then she start to cry
She take a swing that she can't hit!
She don't mean no harm, she just don't know
(Don't know, don't know)
What else to do about it

Then Jane goes to the store at 8
She walks up on St. Andrews
She waits and a-gets her dinner there
She pulls her dinner from her pocket
Jane says, "I ain't never been in love, I don't know what it is"
She only knows if someone wants her

[Hook 2]
"I want them if they want me
I only know they want me"

[Bridge]
She gets mad, and she starts to cry
She takes a swing, man, she can't hit!
She don't mean no harm, she just don't know
(Don't know, don't know)
What else to do about it
