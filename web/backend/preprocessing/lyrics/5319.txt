19 ContributorsGTA Lyrics[Intro]
Get a bag and I'm out yeah, yeah
Shorty on my lap now, yeah
And she playing with the gang now
(Yo blast off Astro)
Flip a bag, now I'm swerving in a Tesla
Got my back, shawty with me, yeah I stepped up
GTA, fuck the opps, ain't no Lester
Ayy yo shoutout Astro, let's do this

[Chorus]
Flip a bag, now I'm swerving in a Tesla
Got my back, shawty with me, yeah I stepped up
GTA, fuck the opps, ain't no Lester
Shawty born to be my angel, yeah I'm blessed up
Cooking right up in the stu', gotta check the fan
Yeah I'm watching out for opps, yeah they not my fans
People treat me like I'm something 'cause I got some bands
Was a loner that was hustling, now I'm filling stands

[Verse]
I been sticking to my paper like I am a staple
I ain't going 'bout this safer, I ain't really able
I been getting all this cash, I don't need a label
Made it up from nothing fast, yeah this is a fable
Now they always hit me up, got me feeling fuego
Got me always plugged up, I ain't talking cable
Spreading all my money cash, right up on the table
Shawty turn into a fan, yeah this is a fable
I look a little toxic baby but don't be afraid
Baby you a goddess, you expensive like the Wraith
We could mess around, maybe plan a trip to Spain
All you gotta do is come to me, we on our way our way

Flip a bag, now I'm swerving in a Tesla
Got my back, shawty with me, yeah I stepped up
GTA, fuck the opps, ain't no Lester
Shawty born to be my angel, yeah I'm blessed up
Cooking right up in the stu', gotta check the fan
Yeah I'm watching out for opps, yeah they not my fans
People treat me like I'm something cause I got some bands
Was a loner that was hustling, now I’m filling stands5Embed GTA GTA Rarin sad
