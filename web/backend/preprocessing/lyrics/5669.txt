She was gone before the morning came
Down the fire escape
She went wild, and wild
In my heart, a burning flame
I thought it couldn't change
Her mind, and mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Love was such a scary thing
You didn't want to fall
I didn't want you at all
Now I'm waiting by a cold window
'Til the sun is gone

[Chorus]
Oh, my, my, my, oh, my, my, my
Now don't think twice
Hold me up until you see the darkness
That I couldn't find lying by your side
Hold me up until you see the light

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Onwards we fumbled in the strangest way
But still, we're losing space
We're tongue-tied, tongue-tied
And both our shadows spun around the room
Then into one from two, we collide, collide

[Pre-Chorus]
Love was such a scary thing
You didn't want to fall
I didn't want you at all
Now I'm waiting by a cold window
'Til the sun is gone

[Chorus]
Oh, my, my, my, oh, my, my, my
Now don't think twice
Hold me up until you see the darkness
That I couldn't find lying by your side
Hold me up until you see the light

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Bridge]
Oh, my, my, my, oh, my, my, my
Oh, my, my, my

[Chorus]
Oh, my, my, my, oh, my, my, my
Now don't think twice
Hold me up until you see the darkness
That I couldn't find lying by your side
Hold me up until you see the light

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Outro]
Oh, my, my, my, oh, my, my, my
