5 ContributorsBe Slow Lyrics[Verse 1]
All these feet on fire
Heavy are your eyes and the weight on your shoulders
Chasing after time
Something you can't touch but you know when it's over

[Pre-Chorus]
No control
When you're running blind
All we know
Is what we left behind

[Chorus]
Darling, you gotta keep breathing
Lose yourself in the feeling
Just be slow
Just be slow
Take it back to that moment
Before you start to feel broken
Just be slow
Just be slow

[Verse 2]
Try to let it go
Step out on the cold, embracing the silence
We were never told
We can sing black songs when we should be flying

[Chorus]
Darling, you gotta keep breathing
Lose yourself in the feeling
Just be slow
Just be slow
Take it back to that moment
Before you start to feel broken
Just be slow
Just be slow

[Bridge]
Oooooh
Cover me with moments
Coloring the motions
Oooooh
Cover me with moments
Coloring the motions

[Chorus]
Darling, you gotta keep breathing
Lose yourself in the feeling
Just be slow
Just be slow
Take it back to that moment
Before you start to feel broken
Just be slow
Just be slowEmbed Be Slow Be Slow Harrison Storm folk
