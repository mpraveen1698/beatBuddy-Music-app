4 ContributorsI Believe Lyrics[Verse 1]
Blow my mind, blow my mind, blow my mind now
Take me high, take me high, spin me right 'round
Don't know why, don't know why it's burnin' me out
I won't get it right, stay at home all night
Out of sight, out of sight, I'm hidin' right now
You're dynamite, dynamite, yeah, I got no doubt
Way too tight, way too tight, I need a time-out
I can't get it right, stay at home all night

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe that someone in my bed is not enough
And I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe it's only in my head, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe that someone in my bed is not enough
And I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe it's only in my head, yeah

[Verse 2]
Blow my mind, blow my mind, blow my mind now
Every night, every night, I'm on my way down
You're so high, you're so high, my feet on the ground
I can't get it right all alone tonight
You might also like[Bridge]
It's been too long, I'm out of time
I'll leave you high and dry
It feels so wrong, you felt so right
Fell out of love tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe it's only in my head, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe that someone in my bed is not enough
And I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe it's only in my head, yeah

[Bridge]
Ba-da-dam, ah
Ba-da-dam, ba-da-dam, ba-da-dam, ah
Ba-da-dam, ba-da-dam, ba-da-dam, ah
Ba-da-dam, ba-da-dam, ba-da-dam, ah
Ba-da-dam, ba-da-dam

[Outro]
I believe I'd rather fall asleep than fall in love
And I believe that someone in my bed is not enoughEmbed I Believe I Believe KAMRAD german
