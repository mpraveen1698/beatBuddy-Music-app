Here's a little story how the west was won
The white man came and took out everyone
The used dirty blankets and they used machine guns
And they didn't think twice about what they've done

Here's a little story 'bout Kevin Bacon
He had a bunch of money but he got taken
He got a bunch of lawyers and he tried to sue
But Bernie looked at him and said, "Hey, fuck you!"

[Chorus]
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight
You'll lose!
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight
You'll lose!

[Verse 2]
Here's a little story 'bout the congressmen
They bailed out all of their billionaire friends
You can blame Bush or you can try and blame Obama, but
You should have fucking learned from your daddy or your mama!

[Chorus]
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight
You'll lose!

Some fights just ain't fair
Some fights just ain't fair
No, some fights just ain't fair

[Chorus]
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight
You'll lose!

[Verse 4]
Here's a little story 'bout Tienanmen Square
The people rose up and said "Life ain't fair!"
Now they sweatin' in the shop making iPhones thin
You stand in front of tanks, the tanks are going to win!

[Chorus]
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight
You'll lose!
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight
You'll lose!
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight
You'll lose!
Don't bring a knife
Don't bring a knife
You'll lose!3Embed Gunfight Connect Sick Puppies grunge
