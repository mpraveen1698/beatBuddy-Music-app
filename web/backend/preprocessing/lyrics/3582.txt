16 ContributorsTake the Money and Run Lyrics[Intro]
Hoo hoo

[Verse 1]
This here's a story 'bout Billy Joe and Bobbie Sue
Two young lovers with nothing better to do
Than sit around the house, get high, and watch the tube
And here's what happened when they decided to cut loose
They headed down to, ooh, old El Paso
That's where they ran into a great big hassle
Billy Joe shot a man while robbing his castle
Bobbie Sue took the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo

[Chorus]
Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo
Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo

[Verse 2]
Billy Mack is a detective down in Texas
You know he knows just exactly what the facts is
He ain't gonna let those two escape justice
He makes his living off of the people's taxes
Bobbie Sue, whoa, whoa, she slipped away
Billy Joe caught up to her the very next day
They got the money, hey, you know they got away
They headed down south, and they're still running today
Singing
[Chorus]
Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo
Go on, take the money and run, oh Lord
Go on, take the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Go on, take the money and run (Yeah, yeah)
Hoo hoo hoo
Go on, take the money and run, oh Lord
Go on, take the money and run (Yeah, yeah)
Hoo hoo hoo
Go on, take the money and run, oh LordSee Steve Miller Band LiveGet tickets as low as $74You might also like1Embed Take The Money And Run Fly Like An Eagle Steve Miller Band psych-rock
