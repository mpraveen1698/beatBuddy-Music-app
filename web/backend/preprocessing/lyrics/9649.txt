1 ContributorNathan Brown (Diss Track) Lyrics[On That Time]
[Part 1]

[Intro]
Ahhh
Nathan Brown you fucked up mate

[Pre-Chorus]
Lasto, lasto (Lasto)
Trash oh, trash oh (Trash oh)

[Chorus]
Fire Lasto have no developments
Fire Lasto have no developments
It's trash so it's not an element
It's trash so it's not an element

[Verse 1]
Not repeating you just getting more defeated
Beaten you about over 20 times
Think you Drake or Ye but you can't even say one word
No one gives a shit about your new shit
Fire Lasto is a pile of shit it has no improvements
You can't handle criticism you just an easy offender
You touch kids you a sex offender
I'm just ascending so I'm becoming an ascender
This too icy call it December, Charmander use fuckin' Ember
To burn this shit face bastard, you asked it
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Lasto, lasto (Lasto)
Trash oh, trash oh (Trash oh)

[Chorus]
Fire Lasto have no developments
Fire Lasto have no developments
It's trash so it's not an element
It's trash so it's not an element

[Verse 2]
Nathan listen here you fuckin' shit
You don't do that to my friends that's is
Get them into trouble even though you staring
You always comparing, you are egotistical
Fire Lasto doesn't even have any mystical
Because Nathan you aren't lyrical

[Part 2]

[Intro]
Nathan be snitching and getting me into trouble and
Blame (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse]
He'll be snitchin' like 6ix9ine
We ask him to pull up, we ask him to pull up
Right now, right now
Nate Mate you need a chill
Can't skill past me you are scared
Why you staring at me and my friends
You pedo, you pedo
I'll knock you out bitch
You slam down to the rock concrete
Sock you in the eye and you get defeated
You'd get beat by me
Big Ant Dog vs Nate
That'll be fatal for you
When this virus goes
I'ma pull up my other foes
Don't even trust the other hoes
4 AM now this how we go
Don't care what Trump or Joe say
They both betray I'm not American but... yeah
Nathan, you can't even say shit to me
Got the place on yo small dick
You all depict the shit
Punch you in the nose you be knocked out
Predict the shit like I'ma genie
Eating yo mommas punani
She isn't a meany, but she is creamy
She felt dreamy but I still fucked
Fuck that disrespect shit
You don't expect shit foe
Ashley, you scream like you takin' a dick hoe
Woah, woah fuck that shit
You think you the shit when you was a Pokemon
Now you are poke gone, I'ma chokehold till you dumb
And land some punches and my friends join in too
You really think you Mario but when I jump over your head
You probably cry like a girl who wants candy
Play the Jazz in yo face I'ma be Sandy Williams
It's getting randy over here RKO
You stink of shit you won't do shit
And you suck dick
He'll be snitchin' like 6ix9ine
We ask him to pull up, we ask him to pull up
Right now, right nowEmbed Acending Acending So Jao sleep
