12 ContributorsWar Zone Lyrics[Intro]
Ya, I'm not gonna lie to you kid, it’s a fucking jungle out there
Keep your head on tight, Unknown Brain, M.I.M.E, baby let's do it

[Chorus]
Y'all see me fly and never drop down, drop down
Smoking high am I, I’m not round, I'm not round
No denying what I got now, I got now
Keep an eye out, keep it locked down, locked down
See me fly and never drop down, drop down
Smoking high am I, I'm not round, I'm not round
No denying what I got now, I got now
Keep an eye out, keep it locked down, locked down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, too strong when I battle with the beast bring a few on
The commander and the chief for my crew oh
Bullets rattling and whistle at a 2 clock
Never sleep eyes open, hands clutching on my loot
This a war zone
This a war zone
Yo, this a motherfucking war zone

[Drop]
This a war zone
Yeah, feel the impact
Yeah, break it open, leaving nothing fucking intact
(We leavin' nothing behind)
Ey yo you've been hacked, it's safe hotdamn but I found it, homie, been cracked
(But ain't nothing inside)
Ey yo, we been back, your bands stacking ’til you flexin’ with the thin stack
(Flexin', oh no we are?)
You been wacked, I kill ’em all, feel the motherfucking impact

Motherfucking impact
Yo, this a war zone homie
Say you ready and prepared, take a minute, make 'em aware
While I be sneaking in the back with a slap n'clap attack, making life unfair
Help me crawling through the mud where the vision saw clearly
Born a shepherd to these sheep, make 'em fear me, this a war zone
Trash talk, trap house, nothing ever given
Yeah, every day’s a bless and thank the lord oh how I'm living
See me ridin' with my top down, cops 'round
Pedal pressing on the gas, I don't think I'll ever stop

[Drop]
Yo, this a war zone homieEmbed War Zone War Zone Unknown Brain;M.I.M.E edm
