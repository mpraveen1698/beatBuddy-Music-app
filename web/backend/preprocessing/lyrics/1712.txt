You say you wander your own land
But when I think about it, I don't see how you can
You're aching, you're breaking
And I can see the pain in your eyes
Says everybody's changing and I don't know why

[Chorus]
So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
I'm trying to stay awake and remember my name
But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same

[Verse 2]
You're gone from here, soon, you'll disappear
Fading into beautiful light
'Cause everybody's changing and I don't feel right

[Chorus]
So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
I'm trying to stay awake and remember my name
But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
I'm trying to stay awake and remember my name
But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same
Oh, everybody's changing and I don't feel the same22Embed Everybody's Changing Hopes And Fears Keane piano
