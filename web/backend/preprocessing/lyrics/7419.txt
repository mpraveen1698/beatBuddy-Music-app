38 ContributorsFuneral Derangements Lyrics[Intro: Spencer Charnas, Ricky Armellino, Spoken Word, Both]
Slave to the plot
Let 'em rot
Or bring 'em back forever
Sometimes
Sometimes
“Dead is better”
Yeah!
Sometimes
Sometimes, dead is better!

[Verse 1: Spencer Charnas, Ricky Armellino & Dan Sugarman, Dan Sugarman, All]
They say, "behind those gates,  eternal life awaits "
But those beyond the grave, come back beyond depraved
With Church bells ringing, I'll start digging
Fast, they'll never know he's missing
Now the cat's back in his cage
"Oh, my God, Gage!"

[Interlude: Spoken Word, Spencer Charnas]
"We pray to thee our God..." ("It's all my fault.")
"...For the blessings You've provided..."
"Louis, don’t do it."
("...From ashes to ashes, from dust to dust...")
"I have to."

I'll see you on the other side
But I'd kill to bring you back tonight
Don't give up, don't let go
I'll make this right (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

I'll dig through sorrow and disgust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Don't give up, don't let go
I'll make this right (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Post-Chorus: Spencer Charnas & Ricky Armellino, Ricky Armellino,  Spoken Word]

[Verse 2: Spencer Charnas, Ricky Armellino & Dan Sugarman,  Ricky Armellino]
They say that time heals all
But I won't heed the call
Buried in misery
Spare me the eulogy
Still, I can't escape this struggle
Driven when push comes to shovel
Whether God's hand or my own
Nothing here is set in stone
[Post-Verse: All]
Create!
Cremate!
All hail The Sematary!

[Chorus: Spencer Charnas, Joe Occhiuti,  All]
I'll see you on the other side
But I'd kill to bring you back tonight
Don't give up, don't let go
I'll make this right (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

I'll dig through sorrow and disgust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Don't give up, don't let go
I'll make this right (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Post-Chorus: Spencer Charnas, Ricky Armellino, Spoken Word]
Remember:
Sometimes
"Dead is better"

[Bridge: Spoken Word]
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha
I played with Mommy, now I want to play with you

[Breakdown: Spencer Charnas, Joe Occhiuti,  All]
It all began with a skid on the pavement
It ends here with funeral derangements
The flesh is living but the souls have spoiled
The wrath of God lays beneath this soil
The flesh is living but the souls have spoiled
The wrath of God lays beneath this soil
[Chorus: Spencer Charnas, Joe Occhiuti,  All]
I'll see you on the other side
But I'd kill to bring you back tonight
Don't give up, don't let go
I'll make this right (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

I'll dig through sorrow and disgust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Don't give up, don't let go
I'll make this right (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Post-Chorus: Spencer Charnas, Ricky Armellino, Joe Occhiuti, Spoken Word]
Remember:
Sometimes
Sometimes
"Dead is better"
