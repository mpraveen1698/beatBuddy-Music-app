What Zeus had kept inside the box broke loose from their confinement
All that was foul was now unleashed upon the world
Pandora, unable to undo what she had done, fell into despair
As she grieved, she heard a feeble quiver from the box
She lifted the lid once more, and out fluttered a small, bright, most beautiful creature she had ever seen
It flapped its delicate wings as it danced around Pandora, lightly brushing against hеr shoulder
Pandora immediately fеlt her angst melt away and her heart glow with warmth
It was hope that was kept in the innermost nook of the box
It trailed behind the miasma of darkness
Assuaging their ill-effects on humankind
Hope gave people the will to carry on living amidst the pain and strifeYou might also like2Embed Intro Jack In The Box j-hope k-pop
