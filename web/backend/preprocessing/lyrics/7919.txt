Touch me, make me feel like this is meant to be
I know you're a friend to me
This shit feel like destiny
Drink your glass, make this thing last and set you free
You know you're stuck in my memory
But I hope you don't forget 'bout me
I want you to know that it's on
Fly to my city, you will
You'll be mine in a New York minute
I want you to know, I hear them all talk but you show

[Chorus]
Grow woman, grow woman
Next time I see you, baby, I'ma be better
Your body, your brain, you know I'll never forget ya
Grow woman, grow woman, yeah
Next time I see you, baby, I'ma be better
Your body, your brain, you know I'll never forget yaYou might also like1Embed SCARLETT'S WEEKEND SCARLETT'S WEEKEND RUSSELL! chill
