Oh, I got no more drama in my life
And it's such a blessing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you
I got no more drama in my life
And it's been amazing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you

[Verse 1]
Took a year 'fore I recognized (Recognized)
That our love had already died (Already died)
Baby, I was down bad, I was down bad, now, I'm healing (Yeah)
Some nights, you would stay here (Stay here)
Some nights, you would disappear
Now, I'll never go back, never go back to that feeling

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I ain't even wondering about everything wе could’ve been
Ever since you lookеd me in my eyes, turned around, and said goodbye

[Chorus]
Oh, I got no more drama in my life
And it's such a blessing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you
I got no more drama in my life (Oh-oh)
And it's been amazing
I'm so glad I finally realized (Yeah)
I'm better without you
You might also like[Verse 2]
You start fights while we’re up late (Up late)
Use your lips to manipulate (Manipulate, uh)
Baby, how’d you do that, how’d you do that, make me need it
(Listen) Some nights, you were "Baby" (Baby), some nights, it was crazy (Oh)
No, I’ll never go back, never go back to that feeling

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I ain't even wondering about everything we could've been
Ever since you looked me in my eyes, turned around (Yeah) and said goodbye (Hey)

[Chorus]
Oh, I got no more drama in my life (Oh-oh)
And it's such a blessing
I'm so glad I finally realized (Yeah)
I'm better without you
I got no more drama in my life (Drama in my life)
And it's been amazing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you
