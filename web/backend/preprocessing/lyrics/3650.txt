14 ContributorsSelf-Destruction Lyrics[Verse 1: Eric Vanlerberghe]
I said, "Go away"
Take a moment, think it over, I said, "Not today"
'Cause everybody sucks, and I cannot relate
And everything is fucked, and I cannot be saved
Maybe that's because I'm on the way
Took everything I had and threw it in the flames
Watch it burn while they're steady taking aim
I guess it came with repercussions
I've been in it for a minute, this is not up for discussion

[Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Tell me that you hate me, and I'll tell you that I fuckin' love it
Tell me you'll save me, and I'll tell you that you're savin' nothin'
Tell me 'bout your demons, and I'll tell you that I've got a dozen
I'll take 'em with me on my path to self-destruction

[Post-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
We go 24/7 'til we're six feet deep
Head in the clouds but our heart's concrete
Burn the whole thing down while they got cold feet
Yeah, they can try to copy but they can't compete
(If you don't know the Devil) Then, you don't know me
Yeah, you don't know the Devil, then you don't know me

[Verse 2: Brian Burkheiser, Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
All the preconceived premonitions
From people who never listen
Creating all the division
Yeah, how can you live with yourself?
I'm the definition of coming to a collision
The old and the new edition
The hero becomes a villain

So tell me that you hate me, and I'll tell you that I fuckin' love it
Tell me you'll save me, and I'll tell you that you're savin' nothin'
Smile at the thought of my demise on the day of judgment
I pay the price on my path to self-destruction

[Post-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
We go 24/7 'til we're six feet deep
Head in the clouds, but our heart's concrete
Burn the whole thing down while they got cold feet
Yeah, they can try to copy but they can't compete
(If you don't know the Devil) Then, you don't know me
Oh, you don't know the Devil, then you don't know me

[Bridge: Eric Vanlerberghe & David Pawson]
Now let me just tell you a little bit about the Devil first
Yeah, I am the one, Alpha Omega, I won't be outdone
My power's limitless, you are like Icarus
You have been flying too close to the sun
I'm on the way like a destination
I clear your brain like a meditation
I'll change your mind like a revelation
So, get out the way, get out the way
I see what's mine and I'm gonna take it
I do what I say, call it dedication
I built an army into a nation
Now karma is coming, you can't escape it
[Outro: Eric Vanlerberghe]
We go 24/7 'til we're six feet deep
If you don't know the Devil, then you don't know meEmbed Self-Destruction TRUE POWER I Prevail metalcore
