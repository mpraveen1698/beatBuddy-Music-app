(When you're gone)

[Verse 1: Bryan Adams & Melanie C]
I've been wandering around the house all night
Wondering what the hell to do
Yeah, I'm trying to concentrate
But all I can think of is you

[Pre-Chorus: Bryan Adams & Melanie C]
Well, the phone don't ring 'cause my friends ain't home
I'm tired of being all alone
Got the TV on 'cause the radio's playing
Songs that remind me of you

[Chorus: Bryan Adams & Melanie C, Bryan Adams]
Baby, when you're gone
I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Baby, when you're gone
Yeah

I've been driving up and down these streets
Tryna find somewhere to go
Yeah, I'm looking for a familiar face
But there's no one I know

[Pre-Chorus: Bryan Adams & Melanie C]
Oh, this is torture, this is pain
It feels like I'm gonna go insane
I hope you're coming back real soon
'Cause I don't know what to do

[Chorus: Bryan Adams & Melanie C, Melanie C & Bryan Adams]
Baby, when you're gone (When you're gone)
I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on (On and on)
And the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Oh, yeah
Baby, when you're gone
