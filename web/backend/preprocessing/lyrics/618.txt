Mamé, eh (Eh)

[Verse 1: Alonzo & Ninho]
I'm on My Eyes Only in her phone
Baby's going to come home late, I'll charge her on a motorbike, in a Momo helmet, mamé (Eh)
She's cold, I'll give her the three grand jacket from Moschino
Omri, you don't know it but I've wanted you since childhood, mamé
No longer old enough to fight, we're just going to park
I don't play the violin for you (No), you know that I'm violent (Eh)
The dough, all that is good, your future, I can assume
I don't play the violin for you (No), I don't play the violin for you, eh-eh (Eh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ninho]
It's too complicated, I'll stop soon
The heart is black, just like Viano (Yes)
I raise my flash to your health but it's hot, еh-eh

[Chorus: Ninho]
My darling wants Yves Saint Lau'-Lau'
I give you my hеart, don't hurt it (Yes)
Even if I'm very angry, I take the photo
It's all right, eh-eh (Eh-eh)
Stilts, cocktail, coconut (Coco)
I listen to Omah Lay, she sings "Lo Lo" (Yes)
I'm verified, I can't follow you (Follow)
Everything's fine, eh-eh

Madam wants to know my budget for life
But we're still working, so it's varied (Varied)
At the end of the ball, we will count the friends again
Versace on my girl, I take her dancing (Mmh)
It seems that the Seychelles is expensive (Eh)
Tell me the price, I'll tell you if it's within my range
Don't play the vicious girl, I wasn't born yesterday
You act like a sulking girl in the Ferrari (Eh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ninho]
It's too complicated, I'll stop soon
The heart is black, just like Viano (Yes)
I raise my flash to your health but it's hot, eh-eh

[Chorus: Ninho]
My darling wants Yves Saint Lau'-Lau'
I give you my heart, don't hurt it (Yes)
Even if I'm very angry, I take the photo
It's all right, eh-eh (Eh-eh)
Stilts, cocktail, coconut (Coco)
I listen to Omah Lay, she sings "Lo Lo" (Yes)
I'm verified, I can't follow you (Follow)
Everything's fine, eh-eh

[Verse 3: Naps & Ninho]
At this time, I must be in Miami
They sealed the clothes and the Rollie
A little romantic, a little gang in bed, I'm a little Manny, I'm a little Tony
By this time I should be in Miami, they sealed the clothes and the Rollie
A little romantic, a little gang in bed
I'm a little Manny, I'm a little Tony
I'm in the restaurant, feast, we do it instinctively
Ten million and I'll give up (Ten million and I'll give up)
They make crypto, crystals, we took the chef
I prefer my mother's dishes
[Deck: Ninho & Naps]
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, everything is fine
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, everything is fine, eh

[Chorus: Ninho]
My darling wants Yves Saint Lau'-Lau'
I give you my heart, don't hurt it (Yes)
Even if I'm very angry, I take the photo
It's all right, eh-eh (Eh-eh)
Stilts, cocktail, coconut (Coco)
I listen to Omah Lay, she sings "Lo Lo" (Yes)
I'm certified, I can't follow you (Follow)
Everything's fine, eh-eh
