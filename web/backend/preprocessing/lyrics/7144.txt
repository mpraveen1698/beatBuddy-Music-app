10 ContributorsGO TO HELL Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wakin' up in the morning's hard
I miss you even though it don't make sense
It's hurting in my chest to breathe
When all I see are stories of our love
So hard, but it was not enough
I'm goin' out to a party
And the only thing they're asking's, "How you are"
Sayin' I'm okay, but really I'm cryin'
And my head is so fucked from what you did
I'm getting drunk

[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me when
Did you love somebody else?
Did you care when you just
Tore my heart to shreds in someone's bed?
Why don't you take him and go to hell

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' hard to hate you
But I can't stop loving who I thought you were
Was it ever real or were your lips just stained from him?
Don't call me honey
You're the best and worst of all
You might also like[Chorus]
So tell me, tell me when
Did you love somebody else?
Did you care when you just
Tore my heart to shreds in someone's bed?
Why don't you take him and go to hell

[Bridge]
This is my loving last farewell
I hope you both go rot in hell
This is my loving last farewell
I hope you both go rot in hell

[Chorus]
When did you love somebody else?
Did you care when you just
Tore my heart to shreds in someone's bed?
Tell me, tell me when
Did you love somebody else?
Did you care when you just
Tore my heart to shreds in someone's bed?
Why don't you take him and go to hell1Embed GO TO HELL GO TO HELL Clinton Kane singer-songwriter
