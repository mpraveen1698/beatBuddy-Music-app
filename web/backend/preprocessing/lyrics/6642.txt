1 ContributorVan Gogh Sword LyricsKnowledge is definite, my pen is what my weapon is
Abolishing pessimists, hit play when depression hits
My profession is spit, I never had a bar deficit
Everyday I'm doing reps, the lesson is don't quit
They say apply pressure each bar is compressing it
My mind is a diamond rhymes trippy like mescaline
I keep my thoughts progressing I keep the opps guessing
I spit cannonballs then i walk through the wreckage
He said your at the point where you're about to give up
When you feel like you failed and nothing is enough
Messages come in all forms sometimes they come as stones
If there's a rock in your path think twice before it's thrown
That's a gem, that's a jewel, that's an emerald
I sin, I'm a fool but a gentle soul
Knowledge assembled in the face of the real the fake tremble
He looked the old man in the face, his own it resembled
Water has the power to destroy and create
It could kiss you with rain or crush you with it's weight
When you're a warrior of light everything has a price
Discipline divides, that's a type of sacrifice
Work always beats talent he stayed unbalanced
He gave his time to the sword his will was always challenged
He carried his troubles on his back like a forklift pallets
When apocalypse comes you won't hear the horseman gallop
You revert to your training get the sword let you hand go
Then paint starry night in blood like Van Gogh
There's a difference between giving up and surrender
One path is fear and the other is splendor
He could smell the desert, desolation and pleasure
A place to clear your mind and dig for inner treasure
He felt the freedom of the wind and imprisoned by his skin
That's when he realized his breath was the wind within
Earth water and air bender we're all interwoven
That's why the soil and your loved ones release oxytocin
Worrying is just a way that moments get stolen
He took a deep breath and looked for the omensYou might also likeEmbed Feels Like You Feels Like You Faime chill
