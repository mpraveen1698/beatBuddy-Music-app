Mmm, the closer you get
The better you look, baby
The better you look
The more I want you
When you turn on your smile
I feel my heart go wild
I'm like a child with a brand new toy

[Chorus]
And I get the sweetest feeling (Sweetest feeling)
Honey, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Baby, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Loving you

[Verse 2]
The warmer your kiss
The deeper you touch me, baby
The deeper your touch
The more you thrill me
It's more than I can stand
Girl, when you hold my hand
I feel so grand that I could cry

[Chorus]
And I get the (Sweetest feeling)
Mama, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Baby, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Loving you

The stronger you hold me, baby
The stronger your hold
The more I need you
With every passing day
I love you more in every way
I'm in love to stay and I want to say

[Chorus]
I get the (Sweetest feeling)
Baby, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Honey, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Loving you

Unh! (Sweetest feeling)
