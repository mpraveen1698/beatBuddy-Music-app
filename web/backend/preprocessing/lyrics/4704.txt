When routine bites hard
And ambitions are low
And resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways
Taking different roads

[Chorus]
Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

[Verse 2]
Why is the bedroom so cold?
You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives

[Chorus]
But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

[Instrumental Break]
You might also like[Verse 3]
You cry out in your sleep
All my failings exposed
There's a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Is it something so good
Just can't function no more?

[Chorus]
But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Then love, love will tear it apart again
Love, love will tear it apart again86Embed Love Will Tear Us Apart The Best Of Joy Division punk
