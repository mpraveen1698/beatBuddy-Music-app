45 ContributorsDevil’s Advocate Lyrics[Intro]
Woah
One, two, three, four
Woah
Haha
Oh na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na

[Verse 1]
I trade the whip out for a bike, uh
Designer for some Nikes
Switch the stripper for a wife
Black tie for a white tee, uh
I've been moving lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed
Lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed

[Verse 2]
Look, I don't want to try
Keep it cool like iced tea
So if I seem shy
It's 'cause you seem so shiesty
Sellin' what you buy, buy, buy
Just a product of the 90's
If you close your eyes, uh
That's where you'll find me
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm the devil's advocate
You don't know the half of it
Good luck tryna manage it
If a God is a dog, and a man is a fraud, then I'm a lost cause

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
Twenty-two's on the ride (Ride)
Bring me back a five piece (Five)
Same ticket for the rent, yeah
But I split it with a dime piece, uh
Married to my friends
They don't always like me
I stay together for the kids, uh
I gotta do the right thing

[Chorus]
I'm the devil's advocate
You don't know the half of it
Good luck tryna manage it
If a God is a dog, and a man is a fraud, then I'm a lost cause

[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
It ain't right for me
Is it right for you?
If you're missing me
