2 ContributorsDancing in the Street (Stereo) LyricsCallin' out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancin' in the street
Dancin' in Chicago
Down in new Orleans
Up in New York City
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swingin' swayin', and records playin'
Dancin' in the street
Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere, around the world
There'll be dancin'
They're dancin' in the street
This is an invitation, across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughin' singin', and music swingin'
Dancin' in the street
Philadelphia P.A
Baltimore and D.C now
Can't forget the motor city
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swingin' swayin', and records playin'
Dancin' in the street
Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere, around the world
They're dancin', dancin' in the street
Way down in L.A., every day they're dancin' in the street
Lets form a big strong line, and get in time
We're dancin' in the street
Across the ocean blue, me and you
We're dancin' in the streetYou might also likeEmbed Dancing In The Street - Stereo Dance Party Martha Reeves & The Vandellas rock-n-roll
