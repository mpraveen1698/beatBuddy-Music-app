4 ContributorsNot Angry LyricsOh, boy
You know, I know
You're making up the truth
Why can't I go before I loose my cool?
I love you even if it's difficult
Don't worry just because I need to leave
Don't mean I'm sick of us, of you and me
I'm just not good at showing sympathy
Gimme a break
I'm not angry anymore
Just a little bit let down
I'm not angry anymore
Just a little upset now
'Cause I wanna be better than I was before
But I can't do it if we don't mature
Not angry anymore
Just a little bit let down
I love the way you look me in the eyes
When you choke up but can't apologize
'Cause you are too afraid to hurt your pride
I guess you were just so misunderstood
You know I'm never truly gone for good
If I could look inside your brain you know I would
You know I would, you know I would
I'm not angry anymore
Just a little bit let down
I'm not angry anymore
Just a little upset now
'Cause I wanna be better than I was before
But I can't do it if we don't mature
I'm not angry anymore
Just a little bit let down
I'm not angry anymore
Just a little bit let down
(Just a little bit let down)
I'm not angry anymore
Just a little upset now
(I'm just a little upset now)
'Cause I wanna be better than I was before
But I can't do it if we don't mature
I'm not angry anymore
Just a little bit let down
