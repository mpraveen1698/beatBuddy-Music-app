I
Just wanted to believe
That maybe you'd be good to me
I'm just misunderstood, you see
You
Never had a clue
All the days that I spent loving you
Who'm I supposed to give 'em to?

[Pre-Chorus]
I let you in
Again and again
So tell me, baby

[Chorus]
What could I do?
What could I do?
I thought you were an angel
And lost myself when I caught sight of you

[Verse 2]
I'm
Bidding you farewell
You'd never stand a chance in hell
They've got another clientele
You're
Treadin' at the shore
I bet you've never drowned before
In someone that you'd do it for
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I let you in
Again and again
So tell me, baby

[Chorus]
What could I do?
What could I do?
I thought you were an angel
And lost myself when I caught sight of you3Embed ANGEL GABRIEL keshi chill
