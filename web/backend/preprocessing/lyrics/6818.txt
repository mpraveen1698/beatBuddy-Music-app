7 ContributorsThanks for Asking Lyrics[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm all right
Thanks for asking
There's a million things I'd love to say
But you don't want to hear
Yeah, it's all right
I don't need your blessings
I'd rather face the wrath of angels
Than the devil in the mirror

[Chorus]
I don't think God is listening
She told us to follow but left us behind
I've never seen an angel
But I know the devil, and he told me I'm fine

[Verse 2]
"What doesn't kill you will only make you stronger"
That's what everyone keeps telling me
I'd rather capsize than chase an old horizon
Throw me back into the deadest of sеas

[Chorus]
I know that God is laughing
She gave us our wings but nevеr taught us to fly
They say the end is coming
And if that's true, well, I don't think I mind

I always knew it would come to this
Heaven or hell, I can't tell which is which
I always knew it would come to this
Heaven or hell, I can't tell which is which
Tell which is which

[Chorus 1]
I don't think God is listening
She told us to follow but left us behind
I've never seen an angel
But I know the devil, and he told me I'm fine

[Chorus 2]
I know that God is laughing
She gave us our wings but never taught us to fly
They say the end is coming
And if that's true, well, I don't think I mind

[Outro]
Roll, roll, roll
Keep on moving ahead
Roll, roll, roll
Guess I'll sleep when I'm deadEmbed Thanks For Asking AfterLife Five Finger Death Punch groove
