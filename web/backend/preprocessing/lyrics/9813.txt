10 ContributorsReaper Lyrics[Intro]
Okay, look

[Verse]
We startin' a riot but we ain't marchin' with signs
So pick a side and end up on the wrong side of the nine
On this island, I'm feelin' like I'm Primetime in his prime
Or Bron-Bron on the Megatron when I'm out of my mind, you die
I could be coolin'-coolin', why would you tempt me? Look at my temperature
I could just lose it, lose it, but I'm not losin', bitch, I'm an emperor
Pity the fool, the foolish niggas been snoozin' like it's cruising altitude
We at your crewneck and your neck too, get him a special
Hit him in the leg and the breast, better get him a vest
That's two in a biscuit, we just missed pedestrians
We destroyed all the evidence
I'm just lookin' for the nearest exit
Put a sign down, made a real mess
Give it twenty, thirty, forty-five minutes
Niggas killed the game then killed the critics
Anybody 'round, everybody dead
Oh, shit, killin' rappers so the reaper reckon rackin' it up
Redrum sippin', ridin' with the savages, rough
Head hun', hey Hunny with the apple butt
Can we smash or what? It'll be like

[Interlude]
Oh, get it, get it, get it, get it
Oh, shit, get it, get it, get it

Bunch of little bad kids from a small smalltown
With some litty city niggas and they all wild out
I am not a pretty nigga, I'm a dawg right now, okay
