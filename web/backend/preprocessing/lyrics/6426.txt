40 ContributorsNot the American Average Lyrics[Intro: Danny Worsnop]
One, two, three, four
(All the things that you said, was it all in my head?)

[Verse 1: Danny Worsnop]
Come on, baby, keep it down
Honey, hush your lips
Clothes trailing from the backdoor
To the bedroom, and I don't even know your name (Hoe!)
Give me all you've got, make this night worth my time
Make this worth my time, oh!
What I'd give to live this night again
I knew when I first saw you, you'd fuck like a whore!
You'd fuck like a whore!
Hope they hear you scream for more, yeah!

[Chorus: Danny Worsnop]
Your thighs were made for cheeks to graze
My lips, your poison, they bring you to your knees
Your thighs were made for cheeks to graze
My lips, your poison, they bring you to your knees
(Ah, come on!)

[Post-Chorus: Danny Worsnop]
Girl, get down, it's almost over!
Take it all the way, oh!

You stupid fucking whore!

[Verse 2: Danny Worsnop]
And after all of all my dreaming being only you
You're standing there, baby, oh, the things that I could do!
Back to the wall with a drink in my hand!
Back it up, baby, ride, ride, ride!

[Bridge: Ben Bruce]
And one step too late and I never told you (Never told you)
That I can't take another disappointment
Breathing and grasping all leads to another messy ending
Breathing and grasping all leads to another messy ending...

[Outro: Danny Worsnop, Ben Bruce]
Ten inch!
With your back against the wall!
With your face buried in the pillow!
I see you cold, I feel you heartless!
Bitch, you stupid fucking bitch! You stupid fucking bitch!
"Fuckin' bitch"22Embed Not The American Average Stand Up And Scream Asking Alexandria metalcore
