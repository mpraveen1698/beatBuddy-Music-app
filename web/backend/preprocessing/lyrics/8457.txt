14 ContributorsNobody Lyrics[Verse 1: James Arthur]
Dressed up all night, there's no one to impress
Standing in lines till I smell like cigarettes
I don’t know why my friends are so obsessed
With staying up till we're sober, wasting money on regrets
I lost my jacket, about to lose my mind
'Cause it’s 5 AM and I got work at nine
I'm all alone heading for the exit signs
From the minute that I saw you, I started thinking twice

[Pre-Chorus: James Arthur]
There's something 'bout you, you steal the room
I can't believe I've never seen nobody, nobody like you
I'm freaking out, just tryna play it cool
I can't believe I’ve never seen nobody, nobody like you

[Chorus: James Arthur]
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
(I don’t know nobody, nobody like)
Nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
I don't know nobody like
You might also like[Verse 2: James Arthur]
Fuck it, I’ll stay till I'm the last one left
For one chance to say, "You're different than the rest"
We're face to face, tryna get it off my chest, yeah
The lights are going out here, wanna come to mine instead?

[Pre-Chorus: James Arthur]
There’s something 'bout you, you steal the room
I can't believe I've never seen nobody, nobody like you
I'm freaking out, just tryna play it cool
I can't believe I've never seen nobody, nobody like you

[Chorus: James Arthur]
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
(I don't know nobody, nobody like)
Nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
I don't know nobody like

[Post-Chorus: James Arthur]
There's something 'bout you, you steal the room
I can't believe I've never seen nobody, nobody like you
I'm freaking out, I'm tryna play it cool
I can't believe I've never seen nobody, nobody like you
[Bridge: James Arthur]
Nobody, nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
I don't know nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
I don't know nobody like you

[Chorus: James Arthur]
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
(I don't know nobody, nobody like)
Nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
I don't know nobody like1Embed Nobody Nobody Martin Jensen;James Arthur electronic
