All my life, I've been walking on my own
Along the lonely road of the heart
On my side, I got symphonies and songs
To help me find my way through the dark

[Chorus]
Oh, six in the morning with nowhere to go
Sing hello world it feels so good to be home
Lost in the dark, but I'll never be alone
Sing hello world it feels so good to be home

[Post-Chorus]
(Sing hello world it feels so good to be home)

[Interlude]
Hello, hello, hello world
I open my eyes and said hello to the world (Hello to the world)
Hello, hello, hello world
I open my еyes and said hello to the world

[Verse 2]
All night long, I'vе been talking to myself
The voices in my head don't cry
On my mind, I become somebody else
So this is how it feels to say goodbye
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, six in the morning with nowhere to go
Sing hello world it feels so good to be home
Lost in the dark, but I'll never be alone
Sing hello world it feels so good to be home

[Outro]
Hello, hello, hello world
I open my eyes and said hello to the world (Hello to the world)
Hello, hello, hello world
(I open my eyes and said hello to the world)4Embed Hello World Hello World Alan Walker;Torine house
