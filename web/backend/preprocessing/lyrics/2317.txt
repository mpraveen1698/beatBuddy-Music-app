Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life go away with you
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life run away with you
Forever in my mind
I want you to live. I want that more than anything in this world. I want you to fight like hell to stay with us. But with everybody else gone, I know, it might not be what you want. It might be too hard for you to keep fighting, so... if you wanna go, I want you to know it's okay

[Verse]
I was all alone, on my own, it's okay though
Do you really love me, do you really trust me?
I was down bad, feelin' sad, feelin' sorry
Now you really gone, and I can't get you to call me
Wanna run away, fuck this love and fuck this place
If you was a ghost, I would kiss you anyway
I can't fill my lungs, feelin' like I'm outer space
You're the one I love, but you're the one I hate

[Chorus]
I can't really see you with anyone else
All these fuckin' Perce's not good for my health
Wanna end it all, I can’t do this again
Tell her that I love her, she do it for him
I can't really see you with anyone else
All these fuckin' Perce's not good for my health
Wanna end it all, I can’t do this again
Tell her that I love her, she do it for him
