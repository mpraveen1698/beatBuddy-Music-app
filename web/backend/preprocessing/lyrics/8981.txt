Pace man for you
Hold my horses patient
Hey, man, tricks can wait
To heal my emotions

[Chorus]
Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble

[Verse 2]
People say I'm a one hit wonder
But what happens when I have two
I washed your dishes
But I shit in your bathroom

[Chorus]
Even when the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Even when the sun comes up, I'm in trouble

[Verse 3]
We broke your glasses
But covered our asses
Take time silently
Feel real room high five
You might also like[Chorus]
When every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Yeah, every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Imagine when
Every time the sun comes up, I see double

[Outro]
Hmmm
Hmmm

Yes, she is
