I'm sick and tired of singin' the wrong words (Words that you don't wanna hear)
Tryna play these chords that we danced to (Right before you disappeared)
Hopin' that my voice will remind you (Everything that we've been through)
All I make is music for cryin' (Gonna need some more tissues)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, like a river, they fall
Tell me why every song I write
Sounds so sad, sad, sad, yeah

[Chorus]
I can't get my mind off you
Baby, you're responsible for all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)
I can't think of a melody that makes you come back to me
Got all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)

[Verse 2]
I'm sick and tired of singin' the wrong words (Words that I don't wanna say)
Tryna play these chords that we danced to (But they'll never sound the same)
Hopin' that my voice will remind you (When the radio comes on)
All I make is music for cryin' ('Cause you're the only one I want)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, like a river, they fall (Like a river they fall)
Tell me why every song I write (Song I write)
Sounds so sad, sad, sad, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
I can't get my mind off you (Mind off you)
Baby, you're responsible for all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)
I can't think of a melody (Melody) that makes you come back to me
Got all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)

[Bridge]
Yeah, you know who you are, I won't say any names
I just want you to feel what I feel (All these tears on my piano)
So if it’s on in your car, I don't have any shame
That every song I write is, "I want you back", yeah, it's so fuckin' sad, baby

[Chorus]
I can't get my mind off you (Mind off you)
Baby, you're responsible for
All these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)
I can't think of a melody (Melody)
That makes you come back to me
Got all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)

[Outro]
Yeah, you know who you are, I won't say any names
I just want you to feel what I feel (All these tears on my piano)
I can't think of a melody (Melody) that makes you come back to me
Got all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)14Embed Tears On My Piano CHARLIE Charlie Puth dance
