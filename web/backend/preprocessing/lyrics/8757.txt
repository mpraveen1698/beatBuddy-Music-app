When nothing walks up way
When nothing walks up way
I tell you one thing
It's more than I can take
It's more than I can take (huh)

How do you stumble
In a cinematic way
A cinematic way
What do you change
When nothing walks up way
When nothing walks up way

When the wade of eyes
And the fade of time
It's a burden if you let it
Let it change your mind
Let it break your spine
There's an order if you get it

Where it hopefully
Coming home to me
Not a word, but still you said it
And I know what to change
And I swear I won't forget it
(Huh, huh, huhuh)

In a cinematic way

What do you change
Where nothing walks up way
