10 ContributorsWhatever It Takes Lyrics[Verse 1]
A strangled smile fell from your face
It kills me that I hurt you this way
The worst part is that I didn't even know
Now there's a million reasons for you to go
But if you can find a reason to stay

[Chorus]
I'll do whatever it takes to turn this around
I know what's at stake, I know that I've let you down
And if you give me a chance, believe that I can change
I'll keep us together whatever it takes

[Verse 2]
She said "If we're going to make this work
You gotta let me inside even though it hurts
Don't hide the broken parts that I need to see"
She said, "Like it or not it's the way it's gotta be
You gotta love yourself if you can ever love me"

[Chorus]
I'll do whatever it takes to turn this around
I know what's at stake, I know that I've let you down
And if you give me a chance and give me a break
I'll keep us together, I know you deserve much better
You might also like[Bridge]
But remember the time I told you the way that I felt
That I'd be lost without you and never find myself
Let's hold onto each other above everything else
Start over, start over

[Chorus]
I'll do whatever it takes to turn this around
I know what's at stake, I know that I've let you down
And if you give me a chance, believe that I can change
I'll keep us together whatever it takes3Embed Whatever It Takes Who We Are Lifehouse grunge
