Feel the hip hop, if you can rock
Need you, kick that (Turn up the bass)
Go crazy, one by one
Brrt, stick up, hahaha
Ye-Ye-Yeah, kick it, kick it loud
And you forgot to turn up the bass
Go crazy, it's a dangerous world
Brrt, stick up, GIOGIO!

Need you, kick that (Turn up the bass)

And you forgot to turn up the bass
Go crazy, it's a dangerous world!
