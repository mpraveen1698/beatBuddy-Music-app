Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long
No matter what I say or do
I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone

[Verse 2]
You hold me without touch
You keep me without chains
I never wanted anything so much
Than to drown in your love and not feel your rain

[Chorus]
Set me free, leave me be
I don't wanna fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am, and I stand
So tall, just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me

[Verse 3]
Oh, you loved me 'cause I'm fragile
When I thought that I was strong
But you touch me for a little while
And all my fragile strength is gone

[Chorus]
Set me free, leave me be
I don't wanna fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am, and I stand
So tall, just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me

I live here on my knees
As I try to make you see
That you're everything I think I need here on the ground
But you're neither friend nor foe
Though I can't seem to let you go
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down
You're keeping me down, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're on to me, on to me, and all over

[Outro]
Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long30Embed Gravity Little Voice Sara Bareilles acoustic
