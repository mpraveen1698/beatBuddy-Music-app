There's only so far we can fly
Will you stay up with me tonight?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I feel it wearin' off now
Little by little
I just wanna come down and get
Caught in the middle with you
Caught in the middle with you

[Chorus]
You'll never be alone
In the afterglow

[Verse 2]
There's only so much we can say
Before this feelin' fades away

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I feel it wearin' off now
Little by little
I just wanna come down and get
Caught in the middle with you
Caught in the middle with you
You might also like[Chorus]
You'll never be alone
In the afterglow
So I'll be yours to hold
In the afterglow

[Verse 1]
There's only so far we can fly
Will you stay up with me tonight?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I feel it wearin' off now
Little by little
I just wanna come down and get
Caught in the middle with you
Caught in the middle with you
Caught in the middle with you

[Chorus]
You'll never be alone
In the afterglow
So I'll be yours to hold
