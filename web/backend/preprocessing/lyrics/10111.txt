1 ContributorEquanimity LyricsOh it's bad
Really, really bad
Dance about
I need to keep whole just because I can
Cut this collar from my neck

Oh it's bad
Really, really bad
(They brush my gun)
(They brush my gun)

Oh it's bad
Really, really bad
I sound so much happier
Than I really am
But there's no shame in that
But there's no shame in that

I need to keep positive in my head
I need to avoid all the thoughts of death

(Too bad my carpetâ€™s all covered with spit
Now my fist is all wet)You might also likeEmbed Equanimity Mind Temple Tenno chill
