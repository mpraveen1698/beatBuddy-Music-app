Ooh, yeah
All I see is you, is you, is you
Oh, you

[Refrain: Troye Sivan]
How could you ever leave me without a chance to try?
How can I be sorry if I don't know the crime?
I should be mad 'cause you never told me why
Still, I can't seem to say goodbye

[Chorus: Troye Sivan, Troye Sivan & Tate McRae]
Ooh (Yeah)
When I try to fall back, I fall back to you (Yeah)
When I talk to my friends, I talk about you (Yeah)
When the Hennessy's strong, all I see is you, is you, is you, oh, you (Ooh, yeah)
Yeah, ooh (Yeah)
No, I haven't moved on, but trust me, I've tried (Yeah)
If I give you a call, don't hang up the line (Yeah)
When the Hennessy's strong, all I see is you, is you, is you, oh, you

[Post-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Oh, you

[Verse: Tate McRae]
I'm good at overthinking
But I haven't even got this far
All I know is that my mind is
In the back seat of your Corvette car
You got me at my baddest (Baddest)
And you got me 'round your fingertip
Should be fed up with your bullshit
But everything about you, no, I can't resist
You might also like[Refrain: Tate McRae]
How could you ever leave me without a chance to try?
How can I be sorry if I don't know the crime?
I should be mad that you never told me why
Still, I can't seem to say goodbye

[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Tate McRae, Tate McRae]
Ooh (Yeah)
When I try to fall back, I fall back to you (Yeah)
When I talk to my friends, I talk about you (Yeah)
When the jealousy's strong, all I see is you, is you, is you, oh, you (Ooh, yeah)
Yeah, ooh (Yeah)
No, I haven't moved on, but trust me, I've tried (Yeah)
If I give you a call, don't hang up the line (Yeah)

Is you, oh, ooh-woah, oh, oh, you
Is you, is you, oh, you

[Bridge: Tate McRae & Troye Sivan, Both]
I see your face in every stranger everywhere I go (Everywhere I go)
I hear your voice in conversations, every word you spoke (Every word you spoke)
Nearly blocked you on my phone about a thousand times
Yeah, I know I should say goodbye
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Yeah, I know I should say goodbye
[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Tate McRae, Troye Sivan]
