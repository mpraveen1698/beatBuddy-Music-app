3 ContributorsLove You Better Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lovers, strangers. heart breaks, changes
Every day things
Been through it all
Movies, cheap wine, claps and cloud nine
All of this time
I'm still longing for your love

[Pre-Chorus]
You woke me up in the middle of the night
I knew that something wasn't right by the look in your eyes
So close but still so far away
You say we have a good run, but we're turning the page
I wanna try it one more time, but go seperate ways
To close to let it slip away

[Chorus]
So won't you stay?, oh baby stay the night
I know I'll make things right
I give you my word this time
I'm gonna love you better
Stay, oh baby stay the night
I know I'll make things right
I give you my word this time
I'm gonna love you better
I'm gonna love you better

Bitter faces, holy places
We left our traces
Been through it all
So forgive, forget, focus on me
And all that darling
I'm still longing for your love

[Pre-Chorus]
You woke me up in the middle of the night
I knew that something wasn't right by the look in your eyes
So close but still so far away
You say we have a good run, but we're turning the page
I wanna try it one more time, but go seperate ways
To close to let it slip away

{Chorus (x2)]
So won't you stay?, oh baby stay the night
I know I'll make things right
I give you my word this time
I'm gonna love you better
Stay, oh baby stay the night
I know I'll make things right
I give you my word this time
I'm gonna love you better
I'm gonna love you better
Love you better
So won't you stay?, oh baby stay the night
I know I'll make things right
I give you my word this time
I'm gonna love you better
Stay, oh baby stay the night
I know I'll make things right
I give you my word this time
I'm gonna love you betterEmbed Love You Better Made For You John De Sohn;Rasmus Hagen house
