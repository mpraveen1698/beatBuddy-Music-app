Thinking back to the past

Feels like there's 99 tabs

Thinking 'bout what we had
I know you think of it too
It's 3:00 AM in the morning
And I'm thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Nobody compared to you
And I was there for you
Everything was fine
I took my time
And I would care for you
But I saw the signs
Up in my mind
And I would share the truth
But nobody knew
What you were prеpared to do

It can never be the same again

The love you had for me
And your peace of mind
It was all a lie
