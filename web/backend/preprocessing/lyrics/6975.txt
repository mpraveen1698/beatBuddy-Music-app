22 ContributorsSesame Syrup Lyrics[Verse 1]
Staring at your Kate Moss shower curtain
Lying on the bathroom floor naked
Hiding coke inside all your orange Pixy Stix
You take a rail & spread it on your tit

[Pre-Chorus]
You've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to you except me
I've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to me except you

[Chorus]
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago

[Verse 2]
There's a small black notebook that you keep hidden underneath your bed
I've seen before
It says every dirty thing that you did with every single boy
You've ever been with

[Pre-Chorus]
You've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to you except me
I've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to me except you

[Bridge]
And we fall asleep to the scent
Sleep to the scent of long stemmed roses
Always dreaming of sex
Dreaming of sex on the ceiling
And we sleep to the scent
Sleep to the scent of long stemmed roses
Always dreaming of sex
Dreaming of sex on the ceiling

[Chorus]

I heard it a long time ago
