Babe, I can't lie, you been on my mind again
Go 'round one more time, yeah, we can do things you like
You don't need a reason for it
Tell me what you need, make it easy for ya
All of this talk ain't enough
Are you down to see me or what?
When you come through, you know I got you
Babe, I got you

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me when you roll through the H
Goddamn, girl, you look amazin'
Babe, we can drink it all away
What you say, what you say, what you s–

Pour me up another, let it go, I (Oh-oh-oh)
Kick it with my brothers and it's alright (Oh)
I just want a lover for the whole night, yeah
Whole night, yeah, whole night
Pour me up another, let it go, I (Oh-oh-oh)
Kick it with my brothers and it’s alright (Oh)
