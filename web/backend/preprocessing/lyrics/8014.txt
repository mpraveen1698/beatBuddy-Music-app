10 ContributorsI Love to Love LyricsOh I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance
He wants to dance, he loves to dance
He's got to dance
Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance
Oh, I love to love
But there's no time for our romance, no, no, noooo
Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance

The minute the bands begin to swing it
He's on his feet to dig it and dance the night away
Stop, I'm spinning like a top
We'll dance until we drop
But if I had my way

Oh I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance
He wants to dance, he loves to dance
He's got to dance
Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance
Oh, I love to love
But there's no time for our romance, no, no, noooo
Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance

We'll dance until we drop
But if I had my way
Sometimes, instead of going downtown
We'll stay at home and get down
To what I'm trying to say

Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance, yeah, yeah
I love to love
But my baby loves to dance, yes he does

I love to love
But my baby loves to dance, yes he does
I love to love
But my baby loves to dance, yes he does
I love to love
But my baby loves to dance, yes he doesEmbed I Love to Love I Love To Love - The Best Of Tina Charles disco
