Move the crowd when the beat goes down
I rock the stage, they all know my sound (Woo)

I rock the stage, they all know my sound
Move the crowd when the beat goes down
I rock the stage, they all know my sound

[Bridge]
Move the crowd when the beat goes down
Move the crowd when the beat goes down
Move the crowd when the beat goes down
Make it, make it, make it loud

[Drop]
Move the crowd when the beat goes down
Make it, make it, make it loud

[Pre-Drop]
Move the crowd when the beat goes down
I rock the stage, they all know my sound (Woo)

Make it, make it, make it loud
Move the crowd when the beat goes down
