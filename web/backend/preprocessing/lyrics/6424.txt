13 ContributorsSleeptalk Lyrics[Verse 1]
The bloodstains on my hands
Our  three year, one night stand
Love  is bitter when it's spent
Lying next to me in bed
Say her name under my breath (Sleeptalk)
It's  toxic, the same dance
Our  feet firm in quicksand
Love is bitter when I see
How  much I can make you bleed
‘Til you feel like you’re deceased (Sleeptalk)

[Chorus]
Into the night, I drink and drive
Anything to help me let go, let go
You  feel the pain, I feel the same
But we cannot repeat this cycle

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
The worst is yet to come
Oh
The worst is yet to come

[Verse 2]
No, please don't be alarmed
We tend to fall apart
I'm entirely to blame
No, I couldn't keep you safe
If there's trust I will betray (Sleeptalk)
Sunset, sunrise
It's better you're not mine
I had everything to lose
Always find a way to prove
That I'm undeserving of you

Into the night, I drink and drive
Anything to help me let go, let go
You feel the pain, I feel the same
But we cannot repeat this cycle

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
The worst is yet to come
Oh
The worst is yet to come

[Bridge]
I play the victim, like it's tradition
Now I can see that I should have left you alone
The worst is yet to come
One day you'll see
That the truth is, I am just a disease
(I am just a disease
I am just a disease)

[Post-Chorus]
The worst is yet to come
The worst is yet to come
Oh
The worst is yet to come
Oh
The worst is yet to come
[Outro]
I play the victim, like it's tradition
Now I can see that I should have left you alone
Oh
The worst is yet to come2Embed Sleeptalk Sleeptalk Dayseeker metalcore
