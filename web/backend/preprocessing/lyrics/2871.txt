So, what if this is it?
What if it falls apart in front of my face?
I wouldn't be surprised
'Cause it happens every time
And now I'm feeling sick
Doing all these things that just push you away
Baby, tell me, why do I do this every time?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm no good at loving you
But I'll try time and time again
Kiss me now, and tell me why you're still here

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm no stranger to loving
I'm no stranger to falling apart
No stranger to secrets, and monsters, and demons
I'm scared of the dark
I'm no stranger to fighting
I'm no stranger to playing with hearts
No stranger to secrets, and monsters, and demons
I'm scared of thе dark

[Verse 2]
What if this is it? Yeah
Drunk on a Saturday night, mmm

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm no stranger to loving

No stranger to secrets, and monsters, and demons
I'm scared of the dark

I'm no stranger to playing with hearts
No stranger to secrets, and monsters, and demons
I'm scared of the dark
