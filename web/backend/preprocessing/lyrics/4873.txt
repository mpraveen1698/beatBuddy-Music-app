41 ContributorsThe Fight Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nothing suffocates you more than
The passing of everyday human events
And isolation is the oxygen mask
You make your children breathe in to survive

[Chorus]
But I'm not a slave
To a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit

[Post-Chorus]
And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds

[Hook]
Fight, fight!
Fight, fight!
Fight, fight!
Fight, fight!

[Verse 2]
You'll never grow up to be a big rock star
Celebrated victim of your fame
They'll just cut our wrists like cheap coupons
And say that death was on sale today
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds

[Chorus]
But I'm not a slave
To a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit

[Bridge]
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of millions' just a statistic

[Chorus]
But I'm not a slave
To a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit
But I'm not a slave
To a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit
[Hook]
Fight, fight!
Fight, fight!
Fight, fight!
Fight, fight!18Embed The Fight Song Holy Wood Marilyn Manson industrial
