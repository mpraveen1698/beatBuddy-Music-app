I'll be seeing you
In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces
All day and through
In that small café
The park across the way
The children's carousel
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

[Verse 2]
I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you

[Verse 3]
I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing youYou might also like7Embed I'll Be Seeing You Billie Holiday Billie Holiday jazz
