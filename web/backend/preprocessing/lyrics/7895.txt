19 ContributorsBlueberry Hill Lyrics[Verse 1]
I found my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill
When I found you

[Verse 2]
The moon stood still
On Blueberry Hill
And lingered until
My dream came true

[Bridge]
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

[Verse 3]
Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill
On Blueberry Hill

[Bridge]
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
But only to be
You might also like[Verse 4]
Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill
