Carrion!
In a moment I'm lost
Dying from the inside, her eyes take me away
Tear me apart from the inside out!

[Verse 1]
Dead eyes speak in volumes
But our lips refuse to move
Could this ever be the last time?
The final time that we see this through?
Give me the strength to return
Return the breath you've stolen
Give me the means to reset, reset
Her heart I've broken again
Reflections, built upon sorrow
We're walking the darkest roads
Within chests carved with regret

[Chorus]
In a moment I'm lost
Dying from the inside, her eyes take me away
Tear me apart from the inside out, oh!

[Post-Chorus]
From the inside out
The inside out

We've been running blind
Now we're falling through the cracks!

[Bridge]
We're left running
We are running blind
Now we're falling, falling through the cracks
Back to the world of the dead

[Verse 2]
Her shining eyes (Her shining eyes!)
Her shining eyes mark our return
Back to the world of the dead!

[Chorus]
In a moment I'm lost
Dying from the inside, her eyes take me away
Tear me apart from the inside out!

[Outro]
My love I left!
My heart I left!
With my promise to return
A promise to return
A promise to return
A promise to return!4Embed Carrion Horizons (Deluxe Edition) Parkway Drive metalcore
