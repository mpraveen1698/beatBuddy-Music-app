8 ContributorsSad Girls Lyrics[Intro: Rema]
Sad girls
Sad girl, I promise, you'll be okay
(Another banger)

[Verse 1: French The Kid]
Money on my mind, guess you fantasize
Levels to the remedy stuck in my mind
Told my momma, "Shit, I promise we gon' be alright"
Still, I keep you awake at night
Yeah, get it in, only way I'll get it out
At least I made my brother proud
I be riding 'round, they tryna find me now
I'm feelin' happy, I ain't always down, yeah
I know she feelin' me, I'm not a dealer, B, I'm the realest G
I know LSD's how I feel the breeze
I got the sad girls feeling like I'm ecstasy
I got this one girl telling me that I'm the one
Came close, had to pull it when I jam my gun
Got more time when they feel the drums
Got the bass on my mind when I'm feelin' numb

[Chorus: French The Kid]
Come on, little darling, we gon' fly to the sky
I'll be drinking 'til the feeling in my head goes dumb
Yeah, I'm walkin' on clouds, is it real?
I be trippin' with a baddie when I'm standin' 'round
'Cause I like her but this girl a Gemini
And she, and she really got me trapped right now
Are you feelin' the vibes, is it real?
I can't hear you when the music be up so
You might also like[Post-Chorus: French The Kid]
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay)
I'll be drinking 'til the feeling in my head
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay, sad girl, promise you'll be okay)
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay)
I'll be drinking 'til the feeling in my head
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay, sad girl)
Promise you'll be okay

[Verse 2: Rema]
There's something I see about this girl, different
From the first time I saw her
For a moment, she looked like a loner
When she move on the dance floor
She got the vibe, she got that essence where nobody else fi belong
I can tell she a sad girl, love sad boy, this side she be on

[Pre-Chorus: Rema]
Oh, party's over
She cryin' outside
I asked her, "What's wrong?"
She said, "Leave me alone
I don't want your love
Kiss me and just go"
I think she's happy she's a sad girl
[Chorus: French The Kid & Rema]
Come on, little darling, we gon' fly to the sky (Oh)
I'll be drinking 'til the feeling in my head goes dumb
Yeah, I'm walkin' on clouds, is it real? (Oh)
I be trippin' with a baddie when I'm standin' 'round
'Cause I like her but this girl a Gemini (Oh)
And she, and she really got me trapped right now
Are you feelin' the vibes, is it real? (Are you real?)
I can't hear you when the music be up so

[Post-Chorus: French The Kid & Rema]
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay, sad girl)
I'll be drinking 'til the feeling in my head
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay, sad girl, promise you'll be okay)
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay)
I'll be drinking 'til the feeling in my head
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay, sad girl, promise you'll be okay)

[Outro: French The Kid]
And I feel like I'm floatin' through the sky
Baby, tell me if you feel what I feel
I'm imaginin' us smokin', feelin' high
Got this Cali in my pack for the chill
She told me come and fly to this paradise
I got feelings in my body and they never lie
All this liquor in my cup's got me feelin' right
I don't care about my issues when I feel alive, yeahEmbed Sad Girls (feat. Rema) Sad Girls (feat. Rema) Clean Bandit;French The Kid;Rema funk
