16 ContributorsDisco Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't help it with you
Stubborn-hearted blue
Lights come into the room
When disco plays our tune

[Chorus]
'Cause there's nothing like it, not like the way you move
I can try but I can't hide it from you
'Cause I can't wait for you
I can't wait for you

[Verse 2]
Admire all of you
But fire burns me too
Can't stop that disco getting through
Can't stop that disco wanting you

[Chorus]
'Cause there's nothing like it, locking my eyes with you
I can't fight it, splitting my mind in two
'Cause I can't wait for you
I can't wait for you
I can't wait for you
I can't wait for youYou might also like15Embed Disco Disco Surf Curse punk
