My mother, she told me, "Don't get in trouble"
My father, he told me he knew I would
My brothers, they told me, "Don't give a damn"
My sister, she told me to do somethin' good

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm uncontrollable, emotional
Chaotically proportional
I'm visceral, reloadable
(I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy)

[Chorus]
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted
Everybody in the world knows I'm a little twisted, twisted

[Verse 2]
My mother, she told me, "Don't be a quitter"
My father, he told me he knew I was
My brothers, they told me, "Do what you do"
My sister, she told me to do somethin' good

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm uncontrollable, emotional
Chaotically proportional
I'm visceral, reloadable
(I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
