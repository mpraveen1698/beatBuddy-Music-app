(Zaytoven)

[Chorus: Jack Harlow & G-Eazy]
I don't wanna hear about no drama (Nada)
The check ain't right if it ain't no commas (Ooh)
Know she been saying that she's faithful to you (Faithful)
But she been lying like Osama (Like Osama)
I miss Obama (I do)
I went to Drama's, he got his own sauna
Better come get her, 'cause your ho on us
Got a bitch from Samoa, look like Moana (Ooh)
Smoking on marijuana (Uh)
Go ahead and roll one up (Uh)
I got a whole squad, got a whole lineup (Yee)
Oh, you tryna put a show on, huh? (Ayy, uh)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Here I go, na, na
I know a Keisha and I know Lana
They try to get me back, but I'm like, "No, nah, nah"
I'm sorry, I don't want no drama, nah
That's a hard no, pass
My house real big and my car go fast
In the club smokin' Jack Harlow's gas
But I'm about to do the drugs that Carlos has
Old Miami Vice, 'bout to AT4 it
But I don't show up if they don't pay me for it
New York, party on the eighteenth floor
But her ass so fat that I can't ignore it
Woo, I go crazy for it
But to ride the rides, you gotta be eighteen for it
No games, just some foreplay before it
And the sex so good, she wanna pay me for it, no

I don't wanna hear about no drama (Nada)
The check ain't right if it ain't no commas (Ooh)
Know she been saying that she's faithful to you (Faithful)
But she been lying like Osama (Like Osama)
I miss Obama (I do)
I went to Drama's, he got his own sauna (It's true)
Better come get her, 'cause your ho on us
Got a bitch from Samoa, look like Moana (Ooh)
Smoking on marijuana (Uh)
Go ahead and roll one up (Uh)
I got a whole squad, got a whole lineup (I got a)
Oh, you tryna put a show on, huh?

[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]
Ayy
Oh, you tryna put a show on?
Sipping on CÎROC got me so gone
And her best friend bad too
Told me don't mess with her like the Zohan (Wait, wait)
Wait a second, hold on
Why you still got your clothes on? (Why you, why?)
I ain't hit this shit in so long (It's been a minute)
But once I hit it, so long
Shit soaking (Soaking)
Bad bitches put me in they close friends (They do)
From Sactown all the way to Oakland
I get it thumping, got this bitch jumping
[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
I don't wanna hear about no drama (Nada)
The check ain't right if it ain't no commas (Ooh)
Know she been saying that she's faithful to you (Faithful)
But she been lying like Osama (Like Osama)
I miss Obama (I do)
I went to Drama's, he got his own sauna (It's true)
Better come get her, 'cause your ho on us
Got a bitch from Samoa, look like Moana (Ooh)
Smoking on marijuana (Uh)
Go ahead and roll one up (Uh)
I got a whole squad, got a whole lineup (I got a)
Oh, you tryna put a show on, huh?27Embed Moana Moana G-Eazy;Jack Harlow indie-pop
