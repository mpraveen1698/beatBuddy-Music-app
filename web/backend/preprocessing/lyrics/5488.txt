I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
When there's no one else around

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna take you, girl, and hold you
And do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour
Yes I am, oh, yes I am
One more thing I just want to say right here

[Chorus]
I'm gonna wait 'til the stars come out
And see that twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That when my love begins to shine

[Verse 2]
You're the only girl I know
That really love me so
In the midnight hour
Oh yeah, in the midnight hour
Yeah, all right, play it for me one time
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm gonna wait 'til midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait, way in the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine

[Verse 3]
Just you and I
Oh baby, huh, just you and I
Nobody around baby, just you and I
All right
You know what, I'm gonna hold you in my arms
Just you and I, oh yeah
In the midnight hour
Oh baby, in the midnight hour1Embed In the Midnight Hour In the Midnight Hour Wilson Pickett rock-n-roll
