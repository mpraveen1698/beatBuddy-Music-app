17 ContributorsLo/Hi Lyrics[Intro]
Woo!

[Verse 1]
Out on a limb in the wind of a hurricane
Down at the bar like a star in the howlin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody to love you
Nobody to care
If you die, nobody will hug you
No one to answer your prayer

[Chorus]
You get low (Low) like a valley
Then high (High) like a bird in the sky
You get low (Low) 'cause you're angry
Low, high, high, low

[Verse 2]
One at a time, get in line for the masquerade
Drink 'til you cry and you're lyin' in the mess you made

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody to love you
Nobody to care
Nobody to drug you
No one to hold back your hair

You get low (Low) like a valley
Then high (High) like a bird in the sky
You get low (Low) 'cause you're angry
Low, high, high, low

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude]
Ah
Woo! Woo!

[Chorus]
You get low (Low) like a valley
Then high (High) like a bird in the sky
You get low (Low) 'cause you're angry
Low (Low), high (High), high, low
Low (Low), high (High), high, low
Low (Low), high (High), high, low4Embed Lo/Hi "Let's Rock" The Black Keys garage
