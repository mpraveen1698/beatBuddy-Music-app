20 ContributorsLifelines Lyrics[Verse 1: Brian Burkheiser]
When I open my eyes and see the lines that live on the life I left behind
I feel disconnected from the place that I call home
When I try to rewind, I can't design a way to go back to that place and time
I remember that moment that changed everything I know

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
Cut up into pieces, looking for a reason
Who's gonna be there to make me whole?
I can't stop the bleeding, looking for a meaning
Throw me a line and bring me back home
Won't you say something, say something?
I can't do this alone
Cut up into pieces, looking for a reason
Throw me a line and bring me back home

[Verse 2: Eric Vanlerberghe and Brian Burkheiser]
I live with all goodbyes, doesn't matter how hard I try
They end in long nights, spent up, looking back at my life
I feel disconnected from the place that I call home
They hit from the blind side, caught me in the blink of an eye
Just like a landmine, going off inside my mind
I remember that moment that changed everything I know

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
Cut up into pieces, looking for a reason
Who's gonna be there to make me whole?
I can't stop the bleeding, looking for a meaning
Throw me a line and bring me back home
Won't you say something, say something?
I can't do this alone
Cut up into pieces, looking for a reason
Throw me a line and bring me back home

This life can cut like a knife
It leaves lines and divides
This life can cut like a knife
It leaves lines that divide a before and an after

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser and Eric Vanlerberghe]
Cut up into pieces, looking for a reason
Who's gonna be there to make me whole?
I can't stop the bleeding, looking for a meaning
Throw me a line and bring me back home
Won't you say something, say something?
I can't do this alone
Cut up into pieces, looking for a reason
Throw me a line and bring me back home

[Outro: Brian Burkheiser]
When I open my eyes and see the lines
That live on the life I left behind10Embed Lifelines Lifelines I Prevail metalcore
