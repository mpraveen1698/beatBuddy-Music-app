15 ContributorsBetter Friends Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's getting late, my hair is frizzy in the heat
Strawberry wine is sticky on my car seats
I'm all alone
I drove three of my girl friends home
The stars are out but they're covered by the neighborhood
The night is over before it could really get good
I like Ohio but she's putting my soul to sleep

[Chorus]
I just need some
Better friends, somebody who would listen
Better friends, I need a fucking better friends list
Better characters, my borеdom's getting harder to ignore
Bеtter friends who won't say they're in the friend zone
Better friends that won't remind me I'm a bit alone
Better characters who maybe won't let me down
'Cuz oh, I'm down
I'm down, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of this lukewarm type of attitude
Okay with everything but never really in the mood
What should we do, you always answer
"Let's go drive all night"
That'd be okay if it was decent conversation
Not all about what your latest shitty boyfriend did
Honestly I wanna turn this car around
You might also like[Chorus]
I just need some
Better friends, somebody who would listen
Better friends, I need a fucking better friends list
Better characters, my boredom's getting harder to ignore, oh
Better friends who won't say they're in the friend zone
Better friends that won't remind me I'm a bit alone
Better characters who maybe won't let me down
'Cuz oh, I'm down
I'm down, I'm down, oh
Better friends, somebody who would listen
Better friends, I need a fucking better friends list
Better characters, my boredom's getting harder to ignore, oh
Better friends who won't say they're in the friend zone
Better friends that won't remind me I'm a bit alone
Better characters who maybe won't let me down
'Cuz oh, I'm down
I'm down, I'm down, oh1Embed Better Friends Better Friends Abby Cates songwriter
