Like you, be strong to hold the powers of the sun
To dream, believe in strength now I'm the only one, only one
I was an ordinary boy
Until I broke the rules my life destroyed, life destroyed
Until I woke awake scream my mind I shout the ground shakes
How much can I take? My mind will break
Will it break? What can I take?
Can I be your superhero? Superhero

[Drop: Chris Linton]
Can I be your superhero?
Superhero, superhero, superhero

[Verse 2: Chris Linton]
Fly up, away
It's the first time of today, today
To dream, believe
You are the strength, you're all I need, need, need
Oh, gonna give it a shot, only one of me
To shield you all from the enemy
Your superhero, your superhero

[Drop: Chris Linton]
Can I be your superhero?
Superhero, superhero, superhero
