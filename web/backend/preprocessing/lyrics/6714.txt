2 ContributorsNo Piensa Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am not the one who like degrading
Why you gotta test my patience?
Left you behind like a station
Sorry but you are not the one I'm chasin'
I am not property
You better start speaking to me properly
Getting too many things onto me
And you still could've been on with me, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Ven aquí, ven a bailar
Men don't know how to hablar
You think that it's okay
You know it's not okay
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero

[Drop]
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero
Baby, baby, no piensеs que te quiero
Baby, baby, no piеnses que te quiero

[Verse 2]
Hey Ally, hey Ally
See the things you did
See the effects you had on this girl
I know you ain't tryna do wrong
I know the feelings were strong
God gave you that bond, yeah
God gave you that bond

Ven aquí, ven a bailar
Men don't know how to hablar
You think that it's okay
You know it's not okay
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero

[Verse 3]
I am not the one who like degrading

Men don't know how to hablar
You think that it's okay
You know it's not okay
