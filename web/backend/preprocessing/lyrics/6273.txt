8 ContributorsWaiting Lyrics[Verse 1: Daisy Guttridge]
I know I haven't called you
And it's been a few months since I tried to
Maybe I'm scared I'll say the wrong thing
My apartment's been shaking
From the weight of a heart that's breaking
Pretend I don't care, but it's killing me

[Pre-Chorus: Daisy Guttridge]
I'd be happy for you
If you say you're happier with someone else
But I'll be honest with you
Just the thought of it hurts like hell

[Chorus: Daisy Guttridge and Eric Leva]
All this time you've been thinking I moved on
But you should know I waited for you
Even if I tried, I could never let you go
You should know I waited, I'm always waiting for you

[Drop: Daisy Guttridge and Eric Leva]
Oh oh, I'm always waiting for you
Oh oh, you should know, I waited

[Verse 2: Eric Leva]
I know it ain't my business
'Cause I'm the one who asked for the distance
But are you alone? Are you alright?
And maybe you would judge me
If I said that I hope you still love me
Feels like you don't, but I'm scared that I'm right

I'd be happy for you
If you say you're happier with someone else
But I'll be honest with you
Just the thought of it hurts like hell

[Chorus: Daisy Guttridge and Eric Leva]
All this time you've been thinking I moved on
But you should know I waited for you
Even if I tried, I could never let you go
You should know I waited, I'm always waiting for you

[Drop: Daisy Guttridge and Eric Leva]
Oh oh, I'm always waiting for you
Oh oh, you should now I waited

[Bridge]
Ummm, umm

[Chorus: Daisy Guttridge and Eric Leva]
All this time you've been thinking I moved on
But you should know I waited for you
Even if I tried, I could never let you go
You should know I waited, I'm always waiting for you

[Drop: Daisy Guttridge and Eric Leva]
Oh oh, I'm always waiting for you
Oh oh, you should know I waited4Embed Waiting Waiting Vicetone;Daisy Guttridge house
