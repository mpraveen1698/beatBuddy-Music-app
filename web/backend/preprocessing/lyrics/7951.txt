Oh, oh
I won't let it control me
I won't let it control me

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
The memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
And I won't let her control me
No, I won't let her control me
The memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
And I won't let her control me
No, I won't let her control me

[Verse: Mark Hoppus]
Now I'm just a ghost in my own life
So make the most of this goodbye
Do you still dream about me late at night
Or are you out there livin' better times?
You know it's killin' me to let go
I see your face, but it's someone I don't know
Everything was perfect just an hour ago
Will you remember me tomorrow?

And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
I won't let it control me
I won't let it control me

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
I won't let it control me
