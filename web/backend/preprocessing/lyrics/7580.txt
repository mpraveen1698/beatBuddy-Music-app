7 ContributorsLost in Echoes Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think I lost my mind
Everything I knew came falling down
Anything I build comes crashing down
I'm pleading, "God, not now"
Save me from my sins before I leave
Free me from the weight so I can breathe

[Chorus]
The more I fool myself
The more I feel it creeping in
I think I lost my mind again

[Verse 2]
Don't worry, I'll be lost in echoes
Be laughing on my own
It's tragic, but it's the only life I know (Only life I know)
What should I do, what should I be?
(I'm at a turning point right now)
I'm so full of rage, too blind to see

[Chorus]
The more I fool myself
The more I feel it creeping in
I think I lost my mind again
The more I start to fall
The more I don't see me at all
I think I lost my mind again

I keep picturing my ending beneath a yellow rose
I don't recall this type of feeling, a seed inside my bones
My soul's turned its back and left me, I burnt the bridge within
Just another waste of human weighing down this skin
And it pulls me further from the point that I belong
And all you wanna do is take me, break me, hide me away
Or you can shame me, blame me, burn me at the stake on a lie
'Cause my own mind wilts at the thought of being alive
And that I'd like it if I tried

[Chorus]
The more I fool myself
The more I feel it creeping in
I think I lost my mind again
The more I start to fall
The more I don't see me at all
I think I lost my mind again7Embed Lost in Echoes Lost Souls Caskets metalcore
