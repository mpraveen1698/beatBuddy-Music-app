And baby when you sleep, do you dream of me?
And when you're awake, do you think of me?
I need to know, how do you feel?
'Cause baby when I sleep, I dream of you
And when I'm awake, that's all I do
Think about every detail you have
Do you notice when I get mad, I clench my jaw?
Do you notice when I get sad, I tend to fall?
Over my words, I say to you
'Cause I notice when you get mad, you close your eyes
And I notice when you are sad, you let out sighs
I need to know, are those sighs ever over me?

[Chorus]
Do you know how in love with you I am?
Do you see how in love with you I am?
Everything that you do, it makes my heart stop
Oh, it stops
