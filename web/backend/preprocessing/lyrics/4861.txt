There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles
(She came) Blood in the streets, it's up to my knee
(She came) Blood in the streets, the town of Chicago
(She came) Blood on the rise, it's following me
Just about the break of day

[Chorus]
She came and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair

[Verse 2]
(She came) Blood in the streets, run a river of sadness
(She came) Blood in the streets, it's up to my thigh
(She came) Yeah, the river runs red down the legs of the city
(She came) The women are crying red rivers of weepin'

[Chorus]
She came in town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind

Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of fantastic LA

[Verse 4]
Blood screams her brain, they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union

[Outro]
There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles
Blood in the streets, it's up to my knee
Blood in the streets, the town of Chicago
Blood on the rise, it's following me8Embed Peace Frog Morrison Hotel The Doors psych-rock
