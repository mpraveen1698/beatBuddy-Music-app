Now I will tell you what I've done for you
Fifty thousand tears I've cried
Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me (Going under)

[Verse 2]
Don't want your hand this time, I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once (Wake up for once)
Not tormented, daily defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm
Dying again

[Chorus]
I'm going under (Going under)
Drowning in you (Drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (Falling forever)
I've got to break through
I'm going under

[Verse 3]
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
(So I don't know what's real)
So I don't know what's real and what's not
(Don't know what's real and what's not)
Always confusing the thoughts in my head (Oh)
So I can't trust myself anymore

[Bridge]
So go on and scream
Scream at me, I'm so far away (So far away)
I won't be broken again (Again)
I've got to breathe
I can't keep going under
