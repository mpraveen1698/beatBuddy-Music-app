16 ContributorsFalse Pretense Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, it's time to let it go

[Verse 1]
The world's got a funny way of turning 'round on you
When a friend tries to stab you right in the face
Losing faith in everything I thought, I hoped and knew
Don't sweat it
Set a false pretense

[Pre-Chorus]
Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
Yeah, and it doesn't seem likely to fade
Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
'Ca-ca-ca-ca-cause you know

[Chorus]
In sacrifice
False pretense, you'll hurt again
Stop pretending to deny
False pretense, you'll hurt again

[Verse 2]
All along you know you thought you got the best of me
You were wrong and I'm laughing right in your face
I cannot believe you claimed you were my family
Don't sweat it
Set a false pretense

Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
Yeah, and it doesn't seem likely to fade
Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
'Ca-ca-ca-ca-cause you know

[Chorus]
In sacrifice
False pretense, you'll hurt again
Stop pretending to deny
False pretense, you'll hurt again

[Bridge]
Oh, it's time to let it go

I can't seem to understand it
How you've turned out to be so cold
You tried but were caught red-handed
Are you happy with your role?
It's funny to me how you've turned into such a joke

[Chorus]
In sacrifice
False pretense, you'll hurt again
Stop pretending to deny
False pretense, you'll hurt again
[Outro]
So play the game until you run out
And play the game into my head2Embed False Pretense Don't You Fake It The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus punk
