I am sleepless for a weekend
So I start to say goodbye
Say goodbye to all that we had
Say goodbye to what we lost

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't talk
We're not enough and the storms slowly arrives
When the light turns and the cold times arise

[Chorus]
We were running out through the storm, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down and we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark
(And the cold times arise)
(And the cold times arise)

[Verse 2]
It is hard to let it all go
Let the past just disappear
Try to untie from an old life
But it always drags me down

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't talk
We're not enough and the storms slowly arrives
When the light turns and the cold times arise

We were running out through the storm, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down and we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark

We were running out through the storm, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down and we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark
We were running out through the storm, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down and we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark

[Outro]
(And the cold times arise)
