One hunnid
Hey, Maui

[Chorus: Connor Price & Chloe Sagum]
I've been waitin' for a miracle to get over you
I know it's been a while but I still think of you
Remember all the things we said, all the promises
I wish that we could start again, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Connor Price, Chloe Sagum & Both]
Yeah, I know that we called it quits and that's it
But I got to admit, I'm havin' flashbacks
I know that I made mistakes, I'd backtrack
If it meant another chance with you, you
Took this long to finally feel up to
Goin' out and runnin' into you
Feelin' myself, but something's just missin'
Don't wanna believe it's you, you (Yeah, look)
I'm thinkin' maybe we could try it again
And I don't wanna spend another night lyin' in bed
Just thinkin' about all the things we might've been
In my defense, think that I might have been
A little young, littlе dumb for what lies ahead
You the onе that I want in my life 'til death
I don't know how to say it, so I write instead
But I confess

I've been waitin' for a miracle to get over you
I know it's been a while but I still think of you
Remember all the things we said, all the promises
I think that we could start again, ooh-ooh (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Connor Price & Chloe Sagum]
So I'm thinkin' maybe we could start again, what you say 'bout that?
Don't wanna be just friends, I don't play like that, yeah
Maybe we could dance and we could hold hands
And maybe make amends with a late-night chat, so what you doin'?
I'm thinkin' 'bout how your head's in the clouds
But I can't deny, I like how it sounds
I wanna start again, but I don't know how so
I'm still just (Ooh, ooh, yeah)
Reminiscin' on the days it was all about us
But it might not feel the same and I don't know what to trust
Yeah, I've been stabbed in the back wit' a steel knife
So I get it, yeah, I know what it feels like
You and me, that's it, yeah, that feel right
Wanna turn these thoughts into real life
We had it right but the timin' was wrong
Started to drive when the tires fell off
Don't want regrets when I lie in a coffin
So I've been often just
[Chorus: Connor Price, Chloe Sagum & Both]
Waitin' for a miracle to get over you
I know it's been a while but I still think of you
Remember all the things we said, all the promises
I wish that we could start again, ooh-ooh
I've been waitin' for a miracle to get over you
I know it's been a while but I still think of you
Remember all the things we said, all the promises
I think that we could start again, ooh-oohEmbed Start Again Start Again Connor Price;Chloe Sagum sad
