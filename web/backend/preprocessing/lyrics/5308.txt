10 ContributorsNot Sad Anymore Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think I'm gonna clean my apartment
Get rid of all the things that I don't need
Come and pick 'em up if you want them
I'll leave 'em right by the door
I don't want it anymore, mm
I think I'm gonna go to a party
Hang out with the friend you worried 'bout
And I don't have to say I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
And making it all 'bout you

[Chorus]
So hey, what's the use being sad over you?
Now I can't seem to remember being broken (Ah, ah, ah)
And hey, what's the time? 'Cause you're not on my mind
I'm just making sure I won't forget the moment

[Post-Chorus]
When I'm not sad anymore
I'm not sad anymore, no more now
I'm just mad at myself for being dumb enough to love you
But I'm not sad anymore

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna reconnect with my old self
I like the way I was before we met
I'm gonna buy a one-way ticket
Go places I've never been
'Cause I can do anything, mm
Go out on a Monday, spend all of my money, sleep in 'til the afternoon
I got all this time now, when you're not around, and I'm not running after
You took up all my space, and it feels so good to say
You might also like[Chorus]
So hey, what's the use being sad over you?
Now I can't seem to remember being broken (Ah, ah, ah)
And hey, what's the time? 'Cause you're not on my mind
I'm just making sure I won't forget the moment

[Post-Chorus]
When I'm not sad anymore
I'm not sad anymore, no more now
I'm just mad at myself for being dumb enough to love you
But I'm not sad anymore

[Bridge]
I think I'm gonna throw me a party
And dance around the kitchen like I never got hurt, never gave up my heart
It doesn't feel like I loved you at all

[Chorus]
So hey, what's the use being sad over you?
Now I can't seem to remember being broken
And hey, what's the time? 'Cause you're not on my mind
I'm just making sure I won't forget the moment

[Post-Chorus]
When I'm not sad anymore
I'm not sad anymore, no more now
I'm just mad at myself for being dumb enough to love you
[Outro]
But I'm not sad anymore
I'm not sad anymore, no more now
I'm just mad at myself for being dumb enough to loveâ€”
But I'm not sad anymore2Embed Not Sad Anymore Not Sad Anymore Clara Mae swedish
