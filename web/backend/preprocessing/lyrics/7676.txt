When I feel cold
I’ll keep you close
And if I could hold you
And take you home

[Verse 2]
When at night
Your toes touch mine
I’ll sing you to sleep
If you were mine to keep

[Chorus]
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days, they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days, they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath

[Verse 3]
To sway just like
It was Friday night
And all the lights
Will blind me dry
And my lullaby
Is your sigh
And I can feel it
When you cry

I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days, they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days, they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days, they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days, they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath

[Outro]
When I feel cold
I'll keep you close
And if I could hold you
And take you home
And if I could hold you
And take you home1Embed cold/mess cold/mess Prateek Kuhad indie
