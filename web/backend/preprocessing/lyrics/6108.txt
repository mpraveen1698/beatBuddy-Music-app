1 ContributorCurtain Lyrics[Verse 1]
California day dreams
Montana skies
Pennsylvania basements
Along for the ride
The ride of a lifetime
Some people never get this far
And if we don’t go further
At least we know we are
Under center city streetlights
Under Billy Penn
Under every big name band since
I don’t know when
Don’t get it wrong I’m grateful
For everything that’s gone our way
And if we don’t go further
At least we’re here today

[Bridge]
And I know
You'll always remind me
And I swear
We might be the one
Oh why not us?

[Chorus]
So when it’s over
When the curtains close
And the friends we’ve had forever
Are the ones we used to know
I’m sure that it was worth it
No matter what they all may say
Worth it for the people
Still here with us today
And when it’s over
When the curtains close
When the memories are all I have
With the pictures on my phone
I’ll say that it was worth it
Even if they think I’m wrong
Worth it for the people
Who’ve been with me all along
I’ll say that it was worth itYou might also likeEmbed The Riddle of Dreams The Riddle of Dreams Carligo sleep
