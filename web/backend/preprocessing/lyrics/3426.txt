Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

[Chorus: Stract & Shiloh Dynasty]
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

[Verse: Stract]
Something doesn't feel right
Circumstances got me broken, prone to feel like
My whole life is a lie
And I'm looking for a way to get better
But lately my entire world's become gray and the weather
Been cold as ever, that's my real ice
I realize real lies in my real life
Even real eyes can't fathom that they
Wanna see me living life better
But then they never wanna
Ever see me living life better than them
And I'm a friend to them
What is a friend to them
If all my friends be enemies and I'm dead to them?
When will it end?
My days spent on defending my feelings
Showing no emotion, pretending that I'm feeling
Fine but I'm reminded my time is what I'm seeking
I'm like a light beaming at night when I fight demons
It's out of sight, seeming like I cannot quite reach it
'Til I find a peace of mind and I'm giving my life meaning

On

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
On

[Outro: Stract & Shiloh Dynasty]
Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
