When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

[Chorus]
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

[Verse 2]
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak
You might also like[Verse 3]
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
You know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now5Embed Sway (Quien Sera) Hey, Brother Pour The Wine Dean Martin jazz
