5 ContributorsBack Tomorrow Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
And I don't wanna know what you did yesterday
I only wanna know you'll be back tomorrow
And I don't wanna know where you came from
I don't even wanna know where you're going
And I don't wanna know what you did yesterday
I only wanna know you'll be back tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna know where you came from
I don't even wanna know where you're going
And I don't wanna know what you did yesterday
I only wanna know you'll be back tomorrow
And I don't wanna know where you came from
I don't even wanna know where you're going
And I don't wanna know what you did yesterday
I only wanna know you'll be back tomorrow

[Post-Chorus]
You'll be coming back tomorrow
Coming back
You'll be coming back tomorrow
