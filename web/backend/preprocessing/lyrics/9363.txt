46 ContributorsTelephone Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'd like to know your middle name
Let's talk about your parents and your future dreams
I'm interested but distant to a fault
And I'd never want to complicate your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I've gotta let you know
That I think that I love you so
You could be my only one
'Cause I think that I love you so

[Chorus]
I know we only just met
So why do I feel invested?
Do you feel it too?
Do you feel it too?
I can be your best yet
Future favorite regret
Do you feel it too?
Do you feel it too?

[Post-Chorus]
So I'll just tell my telephone
All of the above when I'm alone
You might also like[Verse 2]
I talk a lot, but we could fill your frames
With pictures of our faces 'til we share a name
I'm living on a target and you shot it with an arrow
Now I lost my self-control, I can't stop thinking
And I'm thinking that I lost it
All these aisles feel like miles
Where you go, I'll follow

[Chorus]
I know we only just met
So why do I feel invested?
Do you feel it too?
Do you feel it too?
I can be your best yet
Future favorite regret
Do you feel it too?
Do you feel it too?

[Post-Chorus]
So I'll just tell my telephone
All of the above when I'm alone

[Bridge]
(I've gotta let you know)
(That I think that I love you so)
(You could be my only one)
('Cause I think that I love you so)
I've gotta let you know
That I think that I love you so
You could be my only one
I’ve gotta let you know
[Chorus]
I know we only just met
So why do I feel invested?
Do you feel it too?
Do you feel it too?
I can be your best yet
Future favorite regret
Do you feel it too?
Do you feel it too?

[Post-Chorus]
So I'll just tell my telephone
All of the above when I'm alone
So I'll just tell my telephone
All of the above when I'm alone

[Outro]
He's losing his mind
And I'm reaping all the benefits7Embed Telephone FANDOM Waterparks punk
