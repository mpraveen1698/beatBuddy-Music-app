7 ContributorsImpossible Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did
And you were strong, and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, when all is done, there is nothing to say
You've gone and so effortlessly
You've won, you can go ahead, tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, when all is gone, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own, you can go ahead, tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, impossible
Impossible
Impossible

And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
