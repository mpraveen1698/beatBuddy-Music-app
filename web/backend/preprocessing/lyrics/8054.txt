2 ContributorsFaithful LyricsVerse:
Lord you search me, how you know me
You perceive my every thought from afar
In all my wandering, still you love me
King of glory you pursue my anxious heart

Chorus:
Even when I’m not, you're faithful
Even when I doubt your truth holds
Even when I’m lost you won’t let me go

When my heart is dry your grace flows
No matter where I run, I’m not far from home
Yea, I may be weak but you’re able
Even when I’m not, you’re faithful
Even when I’m not, you’re faithful

Bridge:
Where can I go from your spirit
Where can I hide from your face
Where can I flee from your presence
Where would I go, where would I go

If I rise to the heavens you’re with me
If I fall to the depths of the sea
Even there it’s your hand that will lead me
Wherever I go, wherever I goYou might also likeEmbed Faithful Faithful Erik Nieder ambient
