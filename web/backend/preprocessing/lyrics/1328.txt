Like a river, like a river, sh-
Like a river, like a river, sh-
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river

[Verse 1]
How do you fall in love?
Harder than a bullet could hit ya?
How do we fall apart?
Faster than a hairpin trigger

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you say, don't you say it
Don't say, don't you say it
One breath, it'll just break it
So shut your mouth and run me like a river

[Chorus]
Shut your mouth, baby, stand and deliver
Holy hands, will it make me a sinner?
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Choke this love 'til the veins start to shiver
One last breath 'til the tears start to wither
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river

Tales of an endless heart
Cursed is the fool who's willing
Can't change the way we are
One kiss away from killing

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you say, don't you say it
Don't say, don't you say it
One breath, it'll just break it
So shut your mouth and run me like a river

[Chorus]
Shut your mouth, baby, stand and deliver
Holy hands, will it make me a sinner?
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Choke this love 'til the veins start to shiver
One last breath 'til the tears start to wither
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Shut your mouth, baby, stand and deliver (Like a river, like a river)
Holy hands, will it make me a sinner? (Like a river, like a river)
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Choke this love 'til the veins start to shiver (Like a river, like a river)
One last breath 'til the tears start to wither (Like a river, like a river)
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river56Embed River Church Of Scars Bishop Briggs electro
