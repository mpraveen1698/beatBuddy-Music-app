2 ContributorsHallucination (Extended) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You must be single, that must be why
You sent me some poem the other night
That shit's confusin', I have to say
Oh, you have got some nerve talkin' that way, yeah
Turn it up to let me know you would still give us a go
I'm sorry, but we've done this all before
It's just another show, another story to be told
I'm foolish, I believed you, but now I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to impress me
I know you're intending
To hurt me again
You look like a vision
But now I'm beginnin'
To see through the haze

[Chorus]
Don't be so fake, oh
Your love is a hallucination
Don't be so fake, oh
Your love is a hallucination

[Post-Chorus]
(Your love is a hallucination)
(Your love is a hallucination)

Romeo, baby, he's not the king
Although nobody knows me quite like him
Now that I'm older, I expect to be wise
The truth is out there somewhere in-between the lines, yeah
It's just another show, another story to be told
I'm foolish, I believed you, but now I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to impress me
I know you're intending
To hurt me again
You look like a vision
But now I'm beginnin'
To see through the haze

[Chorus]
Don't be so fake, oh (Oh)
Your love is a hallucination
Don't be so fake (Oh no), oh (Oh no)
Your love is a hallucination

[Bridge]
Don't be so fake
You're not foolin' anyone
(Your love is a hallucination) Oh
Don't be so fake
You're not foolin' anyone (Oh no)
(Your love is a hallucination) Oh
[Chorus]
Don't be so fake, oh
Your love is a hallucination (Oh)
Don't be so fake, oh
Your love is a hallucinationEmbed Hallucination Hallucination Regard;Years & Years house
