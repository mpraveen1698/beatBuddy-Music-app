27 ContributorsI Won Lyrics[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Jack Harlow]
Medals 'round my neck because I won, I won (Won, I won)
Now my momma set 'cause I won, I won (Won, I won)
Out here makin' bands, do what I want (What I want)
Greedy with the phone, I get what I want (What I want)
Skrrt to Hidden Hills up to 101 (101)
She just wanna chill on some one-on-one (One-on-one)
I just hit the gas, bitch, I'm gone, I'm gone (Gone)
I might do the dash on 'em, just because (Woo, yeah)
Medals 'round my neck because I w-w-won

[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
And I'm not gon' stop winnin'
And I'm not gon' stop spendin'
Lifestyle, I'm locked in it
Ten weeks, I've been top tennin'
She need me like oxygen
Fеlt the same 'til I got finished
Big ring with thеm rocks in it
When I pop one I'm like Popeye when he got spinach
I'm clean cut with a pop image
But it's demons that I'm locked in with (Yeah)
Take a flight and switch continents
My old whip ain't have an AUX in it (Brr)
New whip, I just hit a button
Then suddenly there's no top in it (No top in it)
But I still get plenty in it (Plenty in it)
Then I give her that Jimi Hendrix
Lusted over by plenty women
Say I look just like Diggy Simmons
Fresh Prince, I get Jiggy with it
Lotta hits, it's never any misses
Dizzy Whizz, I'm in the city with it
On top, any minute (Any minute)

[Verse 2: 24kGoldn]
Pulled up in that full truck
Made it drop down like her skirt, skrrt
Lames talking that bullshit
Well that bullshit ain't gon' work, work
New crib got a good view
Bring the hood through, what I could do
Lil' baby, she know that I'm worth it
Can't tell me that I don't deserve (Ayy)
Billion bucks if you want this deluxe
Baby, I feel expensive, okay
Yeah, I came from the cut and I ran that shit up
Just to spend it and splurge with the gang
Watch me not give a fuck 'cause it's up and it's stuck
Baby, I'm never going away
Feel like AI when I hit the stage
Never practice, but I came to play (Play)
