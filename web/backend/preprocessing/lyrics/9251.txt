[Verse 1]
What if all the chips were down
And you feel you hit the ground
And the truth is to be found
There's a place where we can go
When the time has come we know
It's engraved inside our soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Here's to being braver
Here's to better days
We are standing stronger

[Chorus]
Let's go, oh, oh-oh-oh
Go, oh, oh-oh-oh
We are who we wanna be
Running wild and free, yeah
Let's go, oh, oh-oh-oh
Go, oh, oh-oh-oh
We are more than powerful
It's all possible

[Verse 2]
All the horses shake the dirt
Throw the dust back to the earth
And change is coming soon
And the new day's gonna rise
And the sun will kiss the sky
Then the stars shine with the moon
