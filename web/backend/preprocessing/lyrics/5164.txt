3 ContributorsI’ll Be Around Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you love someone, just 'cause you do
When you say something it don’t make it true
Long lost for words, but I won't lose you
You know time is cruel, yeah I've been there too

[Chorus]
So I’ll be around
When your heart is strong but your mind is weak
I'll be around
When you're falling down and can't find your feet
I'll be around
When you got no one and you're losing sleep
I'll be around
I'll be ’round

[Verse 2]
When it’s all too much and you fade away
Askin' how you make it through the day
Well it’s a long road but I don't mind the rain
So promise you won't stay this way

[Chorus]
So I'll be around
When your heart is strong but your mind is weak
I’ll be around
When you're falling down and can't find your feet
I'll be around
When you got no one and you're losing sleep
I'll be around

'Cause you know time won't bring you back
Oh you know I wish it worked like that
And I can't stand seeing you like this
You don't need to be alone with the past

[Outro]
So you love someone just 'cause you do
And you say something like "I love you"
And you hate goodbyes but you don't need to
So take your time and I'll see you soon
I'll be aroundEmbed I'll Be Around I'll Be Around Garrett Kato folk
