2 ContributorsZero Feelings Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everybody, everybody asking me questions
Talking shit, we're sitting at the table
Tell me who you're dating, do you have a boyfriend?
Why are you still single? Are you going out much?
I don't get it, I don't get, I don't see the problem
But everybody, everybody's telling me I got one
They say I'm too stand-offish and that I don't really want it

[Pre-Chorus]
But that's just, that's just really who I am
I don't, I don't give a damn 'cause

[Chorus]
I got zero, zero feelings
I don't really feel things
Is that such a bad thing?
'Cause I like how I'm so self-sufficient
You don't know what you're missing
Life is fucking sweet when you got zero feelings

[Verse 2]
I don't gotta worry about every little text I send
Gotta worry about being left on read
I save my money, honestly I'm lucky
'Cause if I wanted it don't matter, I can book a flight right now
No strings attached, I can leave this town
My future's open, I don't know where I'm going
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But that's just, that's just really who I am
I don't, I don't give a damn 'cause

[Chorus]
I got zero, zero feelings
I don't really feel things
Is that such a bad thing?
'Cause I like how I'm so self-sufficient
You don't know what you're missing
Life is fucking sweet when you got zero feelings

[Bridge]
Who needs commitment
When you could just do shit
And not overthink it?

[Chorus]
I got zero, zero feelings
I don't really feel things
Is that such a bad thing?
'Cause I like how I'm so self-sufficient
You don't know what you're missing
Life is fucking sweet when you got zero feelings
