8 ContributorsMeant To Be Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I cook, you do the dishes
And when I'm working late, you record the game
So I don't miss it
And we're good at taking on each other's issues
But we're bleeding through the bandaids
And we're crying through the tissues
And it's kind of romantic
How overdramatic we are
And it's got us this far

[Chorus]
But I think you're the one for someone else
And that shit's hard to say
It's okay, you feel the same and I can tell
It's hard to leave us in the past
But perfect's just a lot to ask
We're meant to be, not madе to last
We were mеant to be, just not made to last

[Verse 2]
And I don't wanna keep you waiting
It's not as simple as a yes or no
It's kinda complicated
But I would leave a five-star review, ten out of ten
Recommend you to a friend if I could
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I think you're the one for someone else
And that shit's hard to say
It's okay, you feel the same and I can tell
It's hard to leave us in the past
But perfect's just a lot to ask
We're meant to be, not made to last
'Cause we put too much pressure on ourselves
Keeping up appearances to please everybody else
It's hard to leave us in the past
But perfect's just a lot to ask
We're meant to be, just not meant to last
We were meant to be, just not made to last
We were meant to be, just not made to last
We were meant to be, just not made to last1Embed Meant To Be Meant To Be Ber;Charlie Oriain songwriter
