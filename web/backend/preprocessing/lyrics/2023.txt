13 ContributorsChasing Stars Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was just like magic
When your hips came crashin'
There were fires burnin' and my hands learnin'
To paint with passion
It was planets meeting
It was synced up breathing
There were angels callin' and more free fallin'
Than I believed in (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories like freight trains hit me
I replay to keep you with me
Better to have had than not at all

[Chorus]
We were chasin' stars
Across the county lines
Two imperfect pieces
With our fingers intеrtwined
And I would do it all again
Knowin' I'd be left bеhind
Oh, what a time
Back when you were mine

Oh, I'm hurtin'
But I'm still certain
That when the pain comes back in waves
Yeah, it was worth it (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories like freight trains hit me
I replay to keep you with me
Better to have had than not at all

[Chorus]
We were chasin' stars
Across the county lines
Two imperfect pieces
With our fingers intertwined
And I would do it all again
Knowin' I'd be left behind
Oh, what a time
Back when you were mine

[Drop]
Oh, back when you were mine
Oh, we were chasin' stars
Oh, we were chasin' stars
[Chorus]
We were chasin' stars
Across the county lines
Two imperfect pieces
With our fingers intertwined
And I would do it all again
Knowin' I'd be left behind
Oh, what a time
Back when you were mine

[Drop]
When you were mine (Oh-oh)
Back when you were mine (Oh, when you were mine)
Back when you were mine
Oh, we were chasin' stars
Oh, we were chasin' stars
Back when you were mine1Embed Chasing Stars (feat. James Bay) Chasing Stars (feat. James Bay) Alesso;Marshmello;James Bay house
