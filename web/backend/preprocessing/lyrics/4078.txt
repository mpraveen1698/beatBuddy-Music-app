I feel left out
Like a child
Every time that you're close
Every time that you walk through the door
I feel let down
Is it fear?
Don't you feel my heart go
Every time you whisper in my ear?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everybody wants to feel love
Everybody wants to be adored-dored
Everybody wants to feel love
Everybody wants to be adored-dored

[Chorus]
I can't keep holding my breath, God forbid you
Leave me like all the rest did
I'm in love again
And tomorrow I'll be sad
Take it out of my chest, God forbid you
Leave me like all the rest did
I'm in love again
And tomorrow I'll be sad

You're sarcastic
You tell lies
But I can handle the truth
It sounds so heavenly to me
I don't want you to hide your issues
Blow them into your tissues
Give 'em to me, uh
Come on, give it to, give it to me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everybody wants to feel love
Everybody wants to be adored-dored
Everybody wants to feel love
Everybody wants to be adored-dored

[Chorus]
I can't keep holding my breath, God forbid you
Leave me like all the rest did
I'm in love again
And tomorrow I'll be sad
Take it out of my chest, God forbid you
Leave me like all the rest did
I'm in love again
And tomorrow I'll be sad
[Bridge]
I decide to come outside
You turn around and you tell me you love me
I decide to come outside
You turn around and you tell me you need me
I decide to come outside
You turn around and you tell me you love me
I decide to come outside
All I can say, all I can say, all I can say is it makes me sad
(I'm in love, in love, in love)
(I'm in love again)

[Chorus]
Can't keep holding my breath, God forbid you
Leave me like all the rest did
I'm in love again
And tomorrow I'll be sad (Tomorrow I'll be sad)
Take it out of my chest, God forbid you
Leave me like all the rest did
I'm in love again
And tomorrow I'll be sad (Tomorrow I'll be sad)Embed Tissues Tissues YUNGBLUD british
