You're getting hit with a groovehammer
Straight to your face
The H, E, double L, up in this fucking place
It's just a groovehammer
Clean to the nose
And all you dickheads best get to know

The H, E, double L, up in this fucking place
It's just a groovehammer
Clean to your nose
And all you dickheads best get to know
Yeah, yeah
It's just a groovehammer

[Verse 1]
And it doesn't really matter if you like it or not
After all, you're thе less, we're thе fucking lot
If you think album one hit the nail on the head
Then listen up

[Spoken Interlude]
The iron ore used to make the groovehammer has been described by geologists as the heaviest matter known to man
First discovered in southeast England
The groovehammer was used to smash the skulls of dicks
If you see anyone with a groovehammer, stay well away as experts have warned it may well be The Motherfucking Hell

[Outro]
So sing it back to me
London
Southeast
Pick it up
