7 Contributors​u turn me on (but u give me depression) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wish I fell for an ax murderer instead of you
He'd kill me too, but at least he'd make it quick
No, he wouldn't get me hot and heavy
Then pretending he never met me
And make me such a crazy bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
I might just be a masochist
I'd let you eat me alive
You call me up
I can't resist
I swear that

[Chorus]
I could punch a hole through the wall
With all this pent-up aggression
I embarrass myself 'til I need witness protection
You get me so damn high
I need an intervention
Yeah, you turn me on, but you give me depression

[Verse 2]
Take me to heaven
Put me through hell
All the way up then all the way down
Gimme attention, then throw a wrench in all of this tension
I don't know how
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
You take control of my body
Putting bad thoughts in my mind
As soon as I look in your eyes

[Chorus]
I could punch a hole through the wall
With all this pent-up aggression
I embarrass myself 'til I need witness protection
You get me so damn high
I need an intervention
Yeah, you turn me on, but you give me depression
You turn me on, but you give me depression

[Bridge]
I might just be a masochist
I let you eat me alive
You call me up
I can't resist
I swear that

[Chorus]
I could punch a hole through the wall
With all this pent-up aggression
I embarrass myself 'til I need witness protection
You get me so damn high
I need an intervention
Yeah, you turn me on, but you give me depression
You turn me on, but you give me depression
You turn me on, but you give me depressionEmbed u turn me on (but u give me depression) u turn me on (but u give me depression) LØLØ punk
