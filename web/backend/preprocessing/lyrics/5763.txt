6 ContributorsNumb the Pain Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know we grew up a little too fast
I miss the days that we'd chill and relax
Where did the time go?
It all passed
Now I need to go back
I had no worries but always have plans
Only thing I did was take out the trash
Now It's much harder to laugh
Hard to get up and then work on my craft
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I need inspiration
Don't need no validation
No more medication
Should try some meditating
I don't need you to save me
Feel like all of you hate me
Everything's been so hard with all the situations lately

[Chorus]
I just need to numb the pain for a minute
I just wanna run away a vacation
I don't know what else to say
Now I just need to numb the pain

Oh, I just wanna numb the pain
Oh
I just wanna run away
I don't know what else to say
Now I just need to numb the pain

[Post-Drop]
I just need to numb the pain

[Verse 2]
Well maybe I'm done, maybe I've lost
Still putting up a fight because
I love my mom, I love my family
When I was young they would all look after me
I don't know why but I feel like a burden
I spend my life overthinking my purpose
Can't really cry, I'm so used to the hurting
Trauma creeps up on me at the wrong moments

[Chorus]
Oh, I just need to numb the pain for a minute
I just wanna run away a vacation
I don't know what else to say
Now I just need to numb the pain
[Drop]
I just wanna numb the pain

[Outro]
I just need to numb the pain for a minute
I just wanna run away a vacation
I don't know what else to say
Now I just need to numb the painEmbed Numb The Pain Numb The Pain Clarx;Anikdote;Shiah Maisel;Catas;Le Malls;CHENDA edm
