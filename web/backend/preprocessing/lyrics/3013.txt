As I look out, you're warning me
Your thoughts devour my point of view (Give you up now)
It’s true, I cower when I will speak
So let's get 'round to why

[Refrain]
I will be the first in line to open up
So I don't mind to give you up

[Chorus]
So let's get 'round to why
The one I need is tied up right now
So let's just wait a while
The one I need is tied up right now
So let's not draw the line
'Cause I can't make my mind up right now
So let's just wait a while
The one I need is tied up right—

[Refrain]
I will be the first in line to open up
So I don't mind
I will be the first in line to open up
So I don't mind to give you up

So let's get 'round to why
The one I need is tied up right now
So let's just wait a while
The one I need is tied up right now
So let's not draw the line
'Cause I can't make my mind up right now
So let's just wait a while
The one I need is tied up right—5Embed Tieduprightnow Tieduprightnow Parcels soul
