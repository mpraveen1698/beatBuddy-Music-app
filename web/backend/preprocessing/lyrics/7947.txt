2 ContributorsBeige (unburdened) LyricsI don't wanna see you smile
I want you in the morning
Before you go performing

Tell me something I don't know and lead me to the place where no one ever goes
Let me go under your skin, and let me find the demons that drive those heavenly limbs

You know you're beautiful
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul
What you got cause I want it all
With your fingers in my mouth I fail to see your faults so please don't let me fall, please don't let me fall

I think weâ€™d survive in the wild
We would eat plants and roots and dream about electric fans
But baby could you kill a man, could you look in his eyes and feel the fire drain out of his hands
And baby do you think about the past, do you wonder if every stupid little thing has led us to this

You know you're beautiful
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul
What you got cause I want it all
With your fingers in my mouth I fail to see your faults so please don't let me fall, please don't let me fallYou might also likeEmbed Beige (unburdened) Beige (unburdened) Yoke Lore folk
