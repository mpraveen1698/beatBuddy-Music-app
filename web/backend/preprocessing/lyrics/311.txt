Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate?
And how much can I be expected to tolerate? Oh
So I started to think about the plans I made
The debt, unpaid
And you just can't call
A spade a spade

[Chorus: Sedona]
I watch the moon
Let it run my mood
Can't stop thinking of you
I watch you (Now I let it go)
(And I watch as things play out like)
So long nice to know you I'll be
Moving on

[Verse 2: Sedona]
We started off in such a nice place
We were talking the same language
I o-open and I'm closing
You can't stand the thought
Of a real beating heart
You'd be holding, having trouble
O-o-owning and admit that I am hoping
You might also like[Chorus: Sedona]
I watch the moon
Let it run my mood
Can't stop thinking of you
I watch you (Now I let it go)
(And I watch as things play out like)
So long nice to know you I'll be
Moving on
Moving on

[Bridge: Sedona]
You
Yeah, I always know the truth
But I can't just say it to you
Yeah, I know the truth
I knew
Yeah, I always know the truth
But I can't just say it to you
Yeah, I know the truth

[Outro: Sedona]
I never thought we'd see it through
I never could rely on you
And few times your face came
Into view
Into view
I'm not into you
Into youEmbed Tek It - Sped Up Tek It (I Watch the Moon) Cafun√© indie
