When she was younger, she would pretend
That her bedroom was a castle, she was fairest in the land
And she got older, and it all changed
There was no time for make-believe and all the magic slipped away

[Pre-Chorus]
Until the light in her eyes it was all but gone
'Cause all the dreams that she had turned out to be wrong

[Chorus]
So keep your head up, princess, 'fore your crown falls
Know these voices in your head will be your downfall
I know it gets so hard, but you don't got far to go
Yeah, keep your head up, princess, it's a long road
And the path leads right to where they won't go
I know it hurts right now, but I know you'll make it home

[Post-Chorus]
So keep your head up
Yeah, keep your head up

[Verse 2]
And now she's grown up, works at a bar
She traded makeshift gowns for serving rounds from sunrise 'til it's dark
And all her friends got someone to hold
And she's got no one else, still not prepared to make it on her own

And now the light in her eyes it's now all but gone
'Cause all the dreams that she had turned out to be wrong

[Chorus]
So keep your head up, princess, 'fore your crown falls
Know these voices in your head will be your downfall
I know it gets so hard, but you don't got far to go
Yeah, keep your head up, princess, it's a long road
And the path leads right to where they won't go
I know it hurts right now, but I know you'll make it home

[Post-Chorus]
So keep your head up
Yeah, keep your head up

[Bridge]
One day you'll find your way back to the start
One day you'll live in your dreams
One day you'll wake up, and girl, you'll be a queen

[Chorus]
So keep your head up, princess, 'fore your crown falls
Know these voices in your head will be your downfall
I know it gets so hard, but you don't got far to go
Yeah, keep your head up, princess, it's a long road
And the path leads right to where they won't go
I know it hurts right now, but I know you'll make it home
[Post-Chorus]
So keep your head up
Yeah, keep your head up11Embed Keep Your Head Up Princess Keep Your Head Up Princess Anson Seabra songwriter
