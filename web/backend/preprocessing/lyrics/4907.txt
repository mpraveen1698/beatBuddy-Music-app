2 ContributorsOne Last Dance Lyrics[Verse 1]
Feel like it's over
Feel like it's over for us
Reach out, you're touching me, but
You could've been anybody
For years I loved you but I
Feel like I'm lying to myself, to myself

[Chorus]
I know we've fallen out of love
But would you have this one last dance with me?
We can't go back to what it was
But would you have this one last dance with me?
I think it might be what we need
To let us go rest in peace
I know we've fallen out of love
But would you have this one last dance with me?
Before I set you free

[Drop]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
One last dance with me, before I set you free
Don't let me down, don't let me down
One last dance with me, before I set you free

[Verse 2]
We lost that feeling
We lost that feeling, it's gone
Hate being sober
It's such a sobering thought
No point in going on we
Both know we want somebody else, somebody else

I know we've fallen out of love
But would you have this one last dance with me?
We can't go back to what it was
But would you have this one last dance with me?
I think it might be what we need
To let us go rest in peace
I know I've fallen out of love
But would you have this one last dance with me?
Before I set you free

[Drop]
One last dance with me, before I set you free
One last dance with me, before I set you free
One last dance with me, before I set you free
One last dance with me, before I set you free

[Outro]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
One last dance with me, before I set you free
Don't let me down, don't let me down
One last dance with me, before I set you freeEmbed One Last Dance One Last Dance Audien;XIRA progressive-house
