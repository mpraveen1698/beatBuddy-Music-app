[Verse 1]
I know that this life gets hard sometimes
I know that depression’s running through your mind
I know that sometimes you just want to cry
But nobody understands so you close your eyes
You might also like[Verse 2]
I know that sometimes you just want to die
I know that sometimes you just wonder why
They leave you on your own just to fight this fight
But I promise you that you gone get through the night

[Bridge]
'cause I’ve seen it with my own eyes
And I’ve felt it in my own life
Yeah, I’ve seen it with my own eyes

Yeah, I’ve seen it with my own eyes
And I’ve felt it in my own life
I’ve seen it with my own eyes
And I’ve felt it in my own life

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I know about’ the feelings that you’re feeling deep within
And i know that sometimes all you want is the evidence

[Verse 3]
That life gone get better
And that the pain fades away
I know you’re under the weather
And wanna see brighter days
I know that you’re in a chapter you wish that you could erase
I know that life gets hard
And you’ve been losing faith

[Verse 4]
And I know
You feel like nobody cares
And I know
You feel like nobody’s there
But I swear
That everything your going through
Is just gone make you stronger
But only if you can promise to
[Chorus]
Just
Hold on
Don’t lose
Control
Now

Just
Hold on
That pain
Gone slow down
Now1Embed Just Hold On Just Hold On Presence sad
