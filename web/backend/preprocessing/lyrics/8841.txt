Now it's time
We're breaking down the walls
Between wrong and right
Tonight we're writing our own laws

[Chorus]
In a world that we created
Only freedom in this place
Tonight, we celebrate it
We rave into space

[Build-Up]
We rave into space

[Drop]
(Rave into space)

[Verse 2]
Now we're here
We've waited for so long
Can you feel the atmosphere?
This is where we belong

[Chorus]
In a world that we created
Only freedom in this place
Tonight, we celebrate it
We rave into space

We'll be looking for lift-off at zero
