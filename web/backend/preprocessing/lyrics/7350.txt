1 ContributorWarm With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Bike stacked, coats racked in the hallway
Night out, I'm wrecked it's been a long day
Tucked in, green wind put my head down
Where are you? Where ya been? I need you around

[Chorus]
We could build a house away from here
You and me, in the middle of nowhere
Fight the frost of the morning blue
I don't care, I just wanna get warm with you
I just wanna get warm with you

[Verse 2]
Wake up, my minds on you
Caffeine, do you need that crossword clue?
Daydream of a life you'd choose
With me, your dogs and some booze

[Chorus]
We could build a house away from here
You and me, in the middle of nowhere
Fight the frost of the morning blue
I don't care, I just wanna get warm with you
I just wanna get warm with you
You might also like[Chorus]
We could build a house away from here
You and me, in the middle of nowhere
Fight the frost of the morning blue
I don't care, I just wanna get warm with you

[Bridge]
So we build a house, make it a home
And it grows as we grow, yeah it shows
We build a home away from it all
At least that's what I'd hoped for

[Coda]
And now I'm at your front door
And this seems unfamiliar
How'd I never get warm with you?
I just wanted warmth for youEmbed Warm with You Warm With You Hayden Calnin folk
