14 Contributors​i luv him. Lyrics[Verse 1]
He's what I want
But I'm not what he needs
He needs to wake up and look in the mirror
And like just what he sees
And it kills me
That I have to leave to watch him go get better
'Cause I'd set myself on fire
If it meant he'd come back after

[Chorus]
Because I love him, I love him
That's why I'm letting him go
I love him, and I want him
But we both need time to grow
And if the world was kind
I could make him stay
It pains me to think of a girl who gets to trace his veins
I love him
But it's better off this way

[Verse 2]
We had the best time, and he was all mine
And I never wanna leave
We'd stay up all night, and when he drifts off
I can't help but watch him sleep
Oh, he's so beautiful
And I tell him all the time
I've never said words more true
I'll stand by them until I die
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, I love him, I love him
That's why I'm letting him go
I love him, and I want him
But we both need time to grow
And if the world was kind
I could make him stay
It pains me to think of a girl who gets to trace his veins
I love him
But it's better off this way, ooh
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm

[Outro]
I love him, I love him
So I have to let him go
I love him, and I want him
I only hope he finds his growth
And if the world was kind
He would wanna stay
And if there's a next one
I hope she can love him the same
I don't know
It doesn't feel better off this way
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I can only pray
Ooh-ooh-ooh3Embed i luv him. i luv him. Catie Turner songwriter
