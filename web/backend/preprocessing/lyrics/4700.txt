56 ContributorsTurbulent Lyrics[Verse 1]
You had your own Pete Wentz and Patrick combined
Writing you songs and singing them all like
Every single day
Tour brings that special pain

[Pre-Chorus]
So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings
I believe, but not in you and me, so
So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings
I believe, but not in you and me, so

[Chorus]
I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'd unlove you like I should have
Months before I did
In the months before I split
It's turbulent, turbulent
I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'd unlove you like I should have
Months before I did
In the months before I split
It's turbulent, turbulent

[Verse 2]
You had your own Awsten Knight (Hi)
He texted back fast, and he made you laugh, yeah, yeah
You must be out of your mind
Well, I know you are
Let's see, where to start?
How about the messages that you still send?
Even though I blocked your number
And I never fucking answer
My anxiety was turbulent and permanent
You gave me hell on Earth
And said to work with it
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings
I believe, but not in you and me, so
So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings
I believe, but not in you and me, so

[Chorus]
I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'd unlove you like I should have
Months before I did
In the months before I split
It's turbulent, turbulent
I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'd unlove you like I should have
Months before I did
In the months before I split
It's turbulent, turbulent

[Outro]
You had a taste of the life
But you grew complacent
And my sanity laced itself
Up in the back of your mind
And that's where you left me to die28Embed Turbulent FANDOM Waterparks punk-rock
