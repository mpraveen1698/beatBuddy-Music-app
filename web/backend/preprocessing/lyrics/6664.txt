39 ContributorsSiren Lyrics[Intro]
You'll be seeing me in your dreams
But I'll be there when your reality drowns

[Verse 1]
There's a bright side
To every wrong thing
If you're looking at me through the right eyes
Darkness in my name
Don't you wanna come and play on the cool side?
Don't be so shy
And there's a pleasure in hiding from the sun
No, I was never one for pretty weather
I'd rather be creep, baby follow me into the water
I'll take you to the darker

[Chorus]
This could be perfection
Or venom dripping in your mouth
Singing like a siren
Love me while your wrists are bound
You've been seeing me in your dreams
But I'll be there when your reality drowns

[Verse 2]
You can pretend
That when you hear my voice
Darling, it's your choice not to fall in
But it's all an act, 'cause I know exactly what you wanting
You know it's what I'm wanting
Boy, I know what you desire
Oh, you're such a bad bad liar
You might also like[Chorus]
This could be perfection
Or venom dripping in your mouth
Singing like a siren
Love me while your wrists are bound
You've been seeing me in your dreams
But I'll be there when your reality drowns
I'll be there when your reality drowns

[Bridge]
Boy, I know what you desire
Oh, you're such a bad bad liar
I want you and I just can't take it
So listen to me when I say it

[Chorus]
This could be perfection
Or venom dripping in your mouth
Singing like a siren
Love me while your wrists are bound
You've been seeing me in your dreams
But I'll be there when your reality drowns
I'll be there when your reality drowns7Embed Siren Siren Kailee Morgue indie-pop
