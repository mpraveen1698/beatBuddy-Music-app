She said, "Hello, mister, pleased to meet ya"
I wanna hold her, I wanna kiss her
She smelled of daisies, she smelled of daisies
She'd drive me crazy, she'd drive me crazy

[Chorus: Angus & Julia Stone]
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Verse 2: Angus Stone]
Be my lover, my lady river
Can I take ya, take ya higher?

[Chorus: Angus & Julia Stone]
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Gonna take her for a ride on a big jet plane
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
