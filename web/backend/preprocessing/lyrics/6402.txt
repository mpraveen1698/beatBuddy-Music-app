5 ContributorsWhat If I Wasn’t Done Loving You? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another love just slipped away
It's hard to tell you when I haven't all this time
Maybe if I wear it on my face
Someone else will let you know I'm not alright

[Pre-Chorus]
With nothing to lose
But all this to drink
I'm drowning in you
I can't help but think

[Chorus]
What if?
What if I didn't know
Letting you let me go
Would leave me here all alone?
Missing you
And what if I didn't run
The second our second chance wasn't gone?
What if you were the one?
What if I wasn't done loving you?

[Verse 2]
I wonder if you ever feel the same
Intimidated by thе way you seemed just fine
I know I told you it'd be bеtter this way
I didn't know that it would it hurt me like that
Should've known that it'd be hard to go back
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
With nothing to lose
But all this to drink
I'm drowning in you
I can't help but think

[Chorus]
What if?
What if I didn't know
Letting you let me go
Would leave me here all alone? (Leave me here all alone)
Missing you
And what if I didn't run (Didn't run)
The second our second chance wasn't gone (Wasn't gone)
What if you were the one?
What if I wasn't done loving you?

[Bridge]
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you
What if I wasn't done loving you?
What if I wasn't done loving you?

[Chorus]
And maybe I should have known
Letting you let me go
Would leave me here all alone
Missing you
And what if I didn't run
The second our second chance wasn't gone?
What if you were the one?Embed What If I Wasn't Done Loving You? What If I Wasn't Done Loving You? Fly By Midnight electro
