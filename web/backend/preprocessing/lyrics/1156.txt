22 ContributorsSomeday Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some days, I'm treadin' the water
And feel like it's gettin' deep
Some nights, I drown in the weight
Of the things that I think I need
Sometimes, I feel incomplete, yeah
But you always say to me, say to me

[Chorus]
Oh, you say someday, when we're older
We'll be shinin' like we're gold
Yeah, won't we? (Won't we?) Won't we? (Won't we?)
Yeah, someday, when we're older
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Babe, happy (Happy), happy
Oh, you say someday, when we're older
We won't worry 'bout the things
That we don't need (We don't need), we don't need (Oh)
Yeah, one day, down the line
Before we both run out of time, you're gonna see
That someday, we'll be all that we need

[Post-Chorus]
Someday, we'll be all that we need

[Verse 2]
I've been the best, been the worst
Been a ghost in a crowded room (Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
I took a chance, took a turn
Took a dive, and it led to you (Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
So many times that I wish
We could be anywhere but here
So many times that I wish
I could see what you see so clear, so clear

Yeah, someday, when we're older
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Babe, happy (Happy), happy
Oh, you say someday, when we're older
We won't worry 'bout the things
That we don't need (We don't need), we don't need (Oh)

Oh, you say someday, when we're older
We'll be shinin' like we're gold
Yeah, won't we? Won't we?

Before we both run out of time, you're gonna see
That someday, we'll be all that we need11Embed Someday Human (Deluxe) OneRepublic rock
