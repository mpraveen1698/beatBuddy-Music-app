いけ いけ団長 頑張れ 頑張れ団長！

[Verse 1]
In the Range outside and I'm thinkin' about loose ends
Even though we cut ties, I don't wanna be just friends
From the day I got your number like Paris in the summer, it ends
Every day goes by, I wish I was in your bed ([?])

[Chorus]
(Ooh) I love you, oh, God
(Ooh) Tryna find a reason why we can't work this out
(Ooh) I love you, oh, my God
(Ooh) It's hard to find a reason why we can't work this out

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love you, oh, my God

[Verse 2]
You were on the West side, I was drivin' down the I-10
And the song came on, got me thinkin' who you chose instead
No, I never thought twice, but I wonder what you see in them
Another day goes by, that I can't get you outta my head
See The Chainsmokers LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]

Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I love you)

[Bridge]
When it hits, I'm convinced that you know it's not over
All my love's counterfeit unless you're comin' over
Do you think of my voice when your city gets colder?

[Break]
