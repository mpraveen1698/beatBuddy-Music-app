8 ContributorsLies in the Eyes of Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've heard her many times before
Something don’t feel right
A humble heart wants to believe
But it's not what I've seen

[Chorus 1]
Something don’t feel right
Lies in the eyes of love
No, it's not right
She tells me lies in the eyes of love

[Verse 2]
You've worked so hard to work it out
You can have it your way
Don't want to ask you questions
So what you got to say?

[Chorus 2]
You know it's not right
Lies in the eyes of love
You know something's not right
She kills my eyes
Lies

[Outro]
Lies in the eyes of love
No, it's not right
She tells me lies in the eyes of loveYou might also likeEmbed Lies in the Eyes of Love Lies in the Eyes of Love Part Time garage
