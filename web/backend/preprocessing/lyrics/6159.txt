21 ContributorsSugar Daddy Lyrics[Intro]
If it's my right to taste the riches of the earth
These bitches better let me work
A private host, a private toast to new horizons
Never mind what I had to do to get these diamonds

[Chorus]
He love me, he give me all his money
That Gucci, Prada comfy
My sugar daddy
He love me, he give me all his money
That Gucci, Prada comfy
My sugar daddy (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
He love me, he put no one above me
These bitches wanna judge me
But I don't care (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)

[Verse 1]
Looking back on the boys that I dated (Ooh)
All the popular boys overrated (Ooh)
Give me brains, money bags, if he's ancient
I'm a young lady taking donations (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
CEO, might take me on trips (On trips)
Pack a suit, might have a few ships (Few ships)
Love a waitress chasin' them tips (Them tips)
But I'm a escort, countin' his chips
You might also like[Refrain]
Got a lot, bitch
On a yacht, bitch
In the tropics
Ooh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
He love me, he give me all his money
That Gucci, Prada comfy
My sugar daddy (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
He love me, he put no one above me
These bitches wanna judge me
But I don't care (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)

[Verse 2]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
All the girls hang around for some cheap wine (Ooh)
Used to think I was down, but I do mind (Ooh)
It's really kind, but for me, love is really blind (Ooh)
Only want a love where the card never decline (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Never had no complications (-Cation)
And the term stays clear as my skin (My skin)
Caviar in the yard for the win (For the win)
Which car do I take for a spin?

[Refrain]
Got my new hips
And my new tits
New life, who dis?
Ooh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
