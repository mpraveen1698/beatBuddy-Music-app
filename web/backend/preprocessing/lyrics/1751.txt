Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel

[Chorus]
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me, yeah
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me, ooh
And I'm feeling good

[Verse 1]
Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel

[Chorus]
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

[Verse 2]
Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean, don't you know?
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world, for me
You might also like[Bridge]
Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine
And I know how I feel

[Chorus]
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me

[Outro]
I'm feeling good!43Embed Feeling Good I Put A Spell On You Nina Simone soul
