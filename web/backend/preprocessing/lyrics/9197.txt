If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take us for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way you like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You like me, I like you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I'm with you alright, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight
I'm with you alright, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars (Hey)
We can go wherever, so let's say it now or never
Nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are (Hey)
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

You can fly away with me tonight
