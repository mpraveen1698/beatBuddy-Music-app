Every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keepin' me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna makeYou might also like4Embed A Million Dreams (Reprise) The Greatest Showman (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Austyn Johnson;Cameron Seely;Hugh Jackman show-tunes
