The cold has a voice
It talks to me
Stillborn by choice
It airs no need
To hold

[Pre-Chorus]
Old man feels the cold
Oh, baby, don't 'cause I've been told

[Chorus]
Stay on these roads
We shall meet, I know
Stay on, my love
We shall meet, I know, I know

[Verse 2]
Where joy should reign
These skies restrain
Shadows your love
The voice trails off again
Where joy should reign
These skies restrain
Shadows your love
The voice trails off again
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Old man feels the cold
Oh, baby, don't 'cause I've been told

[Chorus]
Stay on these roads
We shall meet, I know
Stay on, my love
You feel so weak, be strong
Stay on, stay on
We shall meet, I know, I know
I know, my love, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the cold
Winter's gone, I'm on my own

[Chorus]
Stay on these roads
We shall meet, I know
Stay on, my love
We will meet, I know
So stay on, I know
Stay, my love, stay on
We will meet, I know, I knowEmbed Stay on These Roads Stay on These Roads a-ha synth-pop
