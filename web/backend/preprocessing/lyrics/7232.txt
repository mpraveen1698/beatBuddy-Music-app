7 ContributorsStreet Fight Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm a soldier, I'm a fighter
Take a step back, I'm on fire
Nothing's gonna kill me, nothing’s gonna stand in my way
Try to break me but I can't break
I'm a bad dream and you can't wake
Nothing's gonna kill me, nothing’s gonna stand in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?!

[Chorus]
We're off, full-throttle to the floor
Fists up and we need a little more 'cause
We are ready for a street fight!
Stand down, there's a fire in my soul
All out and I'm losin' all control 'cause
We are ready for a street fight!

[Verse 2]
I'm a mad man in the trenches
Leave you broken and defenseless
Nothing's gonna kill me, nothing’s gonna stand in my way
I'm a car crash on the highway
Better stay down, under my chains
Nothing's gonna kill me, nothin’s gonna stand in my way

Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?

[Chorus]
We're off, full-throttle to the floor
Fists up and we need a little more 'cause
We are ready for a street fight!
Stand down, there's a fire in my soul
All out and I'm losin' all control 'cause
We are ready for a street fight!

[Bridge]
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?!

[Chorus]
We're off, full-throttle to the floor
Fists up and we need a little more 'cause
We are ready for a street fight!
Stand down, there's a fire in my soul
All out and I'm losin' all control 'cause
We are ready for a street fight!5Embed Street Fight Street Fight Adam Jensen blues
