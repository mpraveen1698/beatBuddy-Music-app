[Intro]
Wake in loneliness, loneliness
Falling inside your story
Walking after you, after you
I will share my time

[Verse 1]
Mayoikonda sekai de
Boku no kage to kasanatte ima
I can’t go back

[Refrain]
Ketteiteki “boku” no shoumei wa
Jidai wo ima koete monogataru
You know?
I will be the brand new age, yeah, from this day

[Pre-Chorus]
I will save myself
And the time is now

[Chorus]
Kill my weakness, weakness
Kanarazu koete naite satte
And I stay alive, stay alive
Saigo wo shinjitaku wa nakute
Kill my weakness, weakness
Itsuka kidzuita to shitemo

But you saved me
Wherever you came from
Feel you inside me

For the brighter future
Never fade away, fade away
Keep you close to me, close to me
