1 ContributorFinal Cut (Intro) Lyrics[Verse: Braidz]

I guess i'll take it in stride
Been With Kendricks bitch she’s changing my vibe
Got em thinking B's gee i'm barely staying alive
Been Kicking it with Chronos I’ve been playing with time
While I'm waiting for a turn but the tables aligned
Faking a smile's lately disguised my greatest divide
That I think i'm done with rap, I should break or retire
The album burnt dough like a bakery fire
And I don't feel that emotion so don't pray for my kind
Not fitting in the scene 'cause these Rappers hate my attitude
Trying to build a network when my anger ain't compatible
Brother seems to imitate slamming trees and bashing dudes
Made me start to think that my family’s impacted too
Docs refuse to listen think there’s cancer in my back my dude
The boy crying wolf will be the man that stabs the animal
When it comes to bitches I be acting like I've had a few
I’m Luda watching black mirror banter-snatch then act a fool
The album was for capitol so this should be my lower case
Been going through a roman phase, opened gates to Trojan plays
Was studying the scene just to notice late the photo's fake
So now i'm with the smoke 'til they start toting Braidz a protege
Say my engine colder strange - Still ain’t in my motorway
Call me black matter couldn't see me in an open space
Keep debating giving up and y'all think that i'm joking ay?
I wrote this shit in forty-eight but feel like its my closing case
Tried to make some happy songs don't want you all to know my state
Been going loco lately, maybe I don't even know who's mates
Maybe its the paranoia, What am i supposed to say
When homie makes some stowaways that I could never show 'em straight
Said i had some competition, opposition grown on Braidz
Bet i'd see you two now like going to see Bono play
Miss me with your biggest hits id beat you with my throwaways
Mowgli from The Jungle Book boy, I don't wanna know no snake
Know my change overpaid, i'm tryna' fix up the balance
Without ending back at hospital in schizo apparel
Take every time i whine and throw it into a barrel
And then Sell it to these people who ain't here for my status
Don't want to know me as a person, just my rhythm and ballads
I Remember back in school they found it weird i was rapping
Now i'm with em on that shit but i feel that i'm trapped here
Living in a dybbuk box my spirits been captured
My friends have been begging me to pick up the packet
And go back to the zombie meds' and skip on my passion
Since they make my creative side fickle and scattered
But I don't think that I should, with prescriptions i panic
That i'm out for any vice, I'll turn back into an addict
Since you can trip from Olanzapine and bricks of Avanza
And I ain't proud to say I think my liver's been damaged
From the Whiskey and Daniels 'cause now i drink like my dad did
How'd I get into this pattern, as a kid I was happy
At this rate i'm going by my 60's like nanny
Hit the bricks and just vanish, like "It's wizardry, Harry"
But i'll cast some death spells before this ministry bans me
A lot of dudes isn't impacting - their Image is rapping
Since lyrics and patterns turned to needing gimmicks to grab em
How can we steal the scene back from these industry camera's
'Cause now they'll back a dope cunt once he's got cricket apparel
That ain't a diss to Chill, chill, y'all so quick to attack me
Don't see me play my cards before i switch to my trap deck
All i'm trying to say is if you spit and your rap's fresh
Then you should get acknowledged for it - simple as that shit
Stable work's been hard to find, if i had cash bet
My roll-outs would be bigger than the Michelin-man thing
All these gigs get my ego tripping its bad that
I'm like Trump meeting Kim Jong - I wig on advancing
Living embarrassed but be acting like i'm actually strong
Poke emcee's for beef like some battle rapping cattle prod
Deep down i'd rather eat some Panamax and smash the grog
Self harm don't cut it - I've been lashing at the cats I love
Fact is that I've had enough, I struggle with the terms bro
They come to me for gigs but couldn't come at me for words though
Man I never wanted buzz, just puzzle pieced these turnt flows
So no matter if i'm buttered up, my honey be on burnt toast
Should up and leave just turn ghost - id rather leave a demon 'cause
I could haunt these rappers when i'm busting beats through Ouija boards
Punks I've never seen before now sucking teeth when Liam talks
New wave could be Jedi cops you cunts could still not see my force
Keep to talking but won't rap, I know they're scared to come at me
Since they've seen my hustle knowing bro's prepared to run the scene
Should expose these heads I know who've grown to care for currency
I'm feeling that it's fake all this overbearing love i see
They all trashed my name 'til it could help 'em get further
Wanna see me live now used to vouch for my murder
Tryna' help me succeed, they were drowning the dirt, buds
Treat me like a king, and think the crown ain't deserved, but
Those cowards the worst one, these rappers are pests
They'll Back stab you to death, if you were actual men
You'd Practice and test the wrath of my pen and have my respect
But i'm a waterboard the way my punches tap 'em to death
Now my madness has set, it ain't new to me this evil brain
The only thing that's new is that these dudes are seeing Liam break
Burning off that ethanol, the truth is you don't peep the flame
Judge me off my cover that's why you won't ever see my page
Few won't get to breath if Braidz just did what he wanna
That's why I keep to myself and try to hit marijuana
Still every now and then you'll catch me slip on the powder
Guess deep down I didn't wanna quit i just had too!
Nowadays its like I've got a brittle bong I smash it bro
Memory fading daily in the middle of an action stoned
If I had the money id be hitting wax and racking coke
Its never been my destiny to sit upon a shattered throne
Move to reach the top - so I shimmy on the ladder, know
I'd lyrically embarrass folk with singalongs and dance-y flows
Reppin' fuck subs while hiding riddles on the tracks I spoke
'Cause I don't wanna do it, plus don't think that they could handle bro
Kids have got that sandwich flow, 'bout the bread but little else
Claim they're for community, outta here, i really doubt
Treat gigs like an hour sex - how these emcees spit and bounce
All i hear em saying's that they're down 'til death so kill yourself!
Reel em out, Caught em slipping with the end of my line
Got everybody tripping since they went at me blind
So now you're all beefing, been ahead of my time
Guess I had to shake it first -  ain't test my pen in a while
Ain't left my den in a while, now this scavengers hungry
Fake i'm down then kill these bitches like I'm hanging with Bundy
Been noticing who's real from picking patterns apart g
Saw their drive can't compare - like passenger car seats
Heard along the lines that some faculty's barred me
'Cause the homie's known to get a little manic and nasty
Won't have a choice once these xanny rappers have carked it
And i'm smoking J's daily - like their annual budget
Where there's ammo I'm blasting, I just had to find my gun
To throw some shots in the air since i believe the line was passed
I wanted to be family court, best believe I've tried to love
But if i'm being real there's times these rappers had me crying cunt
Lost jobs for these promotions guess you'd say it got me fired up
And now they're gonna get to see me raw just like a lion does
We're going rawer than a metal scene chick when she's typing stuff
It's me or them somebody's time is up, It's the Final Cut...You might also likeEmbed I'm Only a Fool for You I'm Only a Fool for You Dybbukk sad
