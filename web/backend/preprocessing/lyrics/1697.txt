It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

[Chorus]
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Verse 2]
Mutual misunderstandin'
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

[Chorus]
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

[Chorus]
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all
[Outro]
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all9Embed Sacrifice Sleeping With The Past (Remastered with bonus tracks) Elton John piano
