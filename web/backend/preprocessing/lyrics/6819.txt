4 ContributorsLate Night Trips LyricsIma catch you soon, still in the stu
Be there around 4, still stuck in the booth
Late night trips tryna see my boo
Cute ting, big back, opposite of rude
I’m not here to chat about star signs, i’m tryna catch this vibe or the mood
I’m texting bro like, bro she’s 10 outta 10
These feelings are new

Deep down these feelings are different
This girl is different , i swear there’s a difference
She hates the bars where i rhyme bout girls
So i wrote this ting and i told her to listen
Won’t gеt caught in the prison system
It’s all about dubs, i’m winning
Babygirl have you got my back
Mad, normally i could tеll from a distance

But i clocked, you’re not like the rest
And when i pull up it’s not all about sex
Late night chats, all these deep talks i swear down b you’re passing the test
And i beg you forget your ex, he’s a jokeman nah he’s getting me vexed
School nights, wide awake in my bed, writing these bars, you’re stuck in my head

Like i said you’re stuck
Huh
I don’t like opening up
She wanna talk all night about my past and stuff
But cos of my past i can’t really trust
Is it love or a crush
Would you lie for me once my life gets rough
Would you lie for me once my life gets tough
See let’s take our time no need a for a rush
You might also likeDon’t worry about these other girls, i told you i’m a 100% all yours
Late night trips , hop on the last train, i’ma call you up when i’m right at your door
I can’t lie what we’ve got is different , between us nothing ever feels forced
She’s a 10/10 , classy and polite, i can’t ask for moreEmbed Late Night Trips Late Night Trips Alex1 chill
