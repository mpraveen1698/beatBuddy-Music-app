35 ContributorsBang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

[Hook]
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

[Verse 2]
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play?"

[Hook]
Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down"

[Verse 3]
Music played, and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Now he's gone, I don't know why
And â€˜til this day sometimes I cry
He didn't even say "Goodbye"
He didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
