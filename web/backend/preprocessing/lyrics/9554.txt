4 ContributorsBreakups Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're the only one in the world I wanna talk to right now
The only one to pick me up on a night like this
And I know
You'll be the first thing on my mind in the morning, oh
Sober or drunk, you're the one that I just miss, mmm

[Chorus]
I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
It always ends bad
But I'm lookin' at my phone
And if you're not alone
I don't think I could take that
'Cause I'm drunk at a bar at 2 AM
And I just wanna talk to my best friend
I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
But right now

[Post-Chorus]
All I wanna do is hear your voice
Pretend it doesn't hurt like hell
Drink some wine and talk about the past
And not go ten steps back
But breakups don't work like that

Bought a drink for a girl and I got her numbеr
Even thought about walkin' her out that door, mmm
The only thing that camе close to you is her perfume, oh
Got me wonderin' what we gave it all up for, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
It always ends bad
But I'm lookin' at my phone
And if you're not alone
I don't think I could take that
'Cause I'm drunk at a bar at 2 AM
And I just wanna talk to my best friend
I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
But right now

[Post-Chorus]
All I wanna do is hear your voice
Pretend it doesn't hurt like hell
Drink some wine and talk about the past
And not go ten steps back
But breakups don't work like that
[Bridge]
No, no
Oh, no
I should be moving on
You should be moving on, babe
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
It always ends bad
But I'm lookin' at my phone
And if you're not alone
I don't think I can take that
'Cause I'm drunk at a bar at 2 AM
And I just wanna talk to my best friend
I said I wouldn't call
We said we wouldn't talk at all
But right now

[Post-Chorus]
All I wanna do is hear your voice
Pretend it doesn't hurt like hell
Drink some wine and talk about the past (Oh-oh)
And not go ten steps back
But breakups don't work like thatEmbed Breakups Breakups Seaforth country
