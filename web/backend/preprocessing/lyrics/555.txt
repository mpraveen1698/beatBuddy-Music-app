I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feelin' right
We started makin' out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
(What's my age again?)
(What's my age again?)
That's about the time that she broke up with me
(Please stay with me)
No one should take themselves so seriously
(Please stay with me)
With many years ahead to fall in line
(Please stay with me)
Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age
(With) What's my age again?
(Me) What's my age again?
