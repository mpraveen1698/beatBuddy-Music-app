36 ContributorsWeightless Lyrics[Verse 1]
Manage me, I'm a mess
Turn a page, I'm a book half unread
I wanna be laughed at, laughed with, just because
I wanna feel weightless and that should be enough
But I'm stuck in this fucking rut
Waiting on a second-hand pick-me-up
And I'm over
Getting older

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over
Getting old

[Chorus]
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

Make believe that I impress
That every word by design turns a head
I wanna feel reckless, I wanna live it up, just because
I wanna feel weightless, 'cause that would be enough

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over
Getting old

[Chorus]
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

[Bridge]
This could be all I've waited for
(I've waited, I've waited for)
And this could be everything
I don't wanna dream anymore
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I've been going crazy
I'm stuck in here
[Chorus]
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here15Embed Weightless Nothing Personal (Deluxe Version) All Time Low punk-rock
