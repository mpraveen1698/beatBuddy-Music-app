I've been waiting for you
To come around and tell me the truth
'Bout everything that you're going through
My girl, you've got nothing to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold nights and the Sunday mornings
On your way and out of the grey

[Chorus]
I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Crowded town or silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

[Verse 2]
I've been dreaming 'bout us
Working hard and saving it up
We'll go and see the man on the moon
My girl, we've got nothing to lose
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]

On your way and out of the grey

[Chorus]
I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Crowded town or silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head and
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

[Bridge]
My girl, my girl
It takes one hot second to turn it around
It takes one hot second to turn it around

[Chorus]
I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Crowded town or silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head and
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Crowded town or silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head and
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl7Embed Hold My Girl Staying at Tamara's George Ezra folk
