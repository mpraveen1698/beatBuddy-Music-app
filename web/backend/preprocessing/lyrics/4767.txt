I'm a bad bitch
I make bad decisions
I'm the type to make a nigga think I'm givin' him my heart and then I keep it (Keep it, keep it)
Don't play the victim
Don't fall in love with me, I'm not in love with you
It's just a regular night, I'ma just keep it real wit' you
We off tequila, can we just tell the truth?
My life is a movie, don't make me go home alone
We got all the city lights flashin', so boy it's on
So don't be offended, you gotta admit it
Ain't no other bitches can hold yo' attention

[Chorus]
It got me to thinkin', should I give a fuck? (Yeah)
Know it's hard for me to give a fuck right away
It's so easy just to give it up (Give it up)
'Cause usually I give a fuck by mistake
But I don't give a fuck (Yeah)
Know it's hard for me to give a fuck right away
It's so easy just to give it up (Give it up)
'Cause usually I give a fuck by mistakeYou might also likeEmbed End Up Drunken Wordz Sober Thoughtz Sevyn Streeter alternative
