I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk about  it
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered


I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk about it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
