Has our conscience shown?
Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all kindness gone?
Hope still lingers on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I drink myself of new found pity
Sittin' alone in New York City
And I don't know why

[Verse 2]
Are we listening?
Hymns of offering
Have we eyes to see?
Love is gathering

[Pre-Chorus]
All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one
Into one

[Chorus]
So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laughed at myself
While the tears rolled down
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh, it's the world I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why, don't know why

[Chorus]
So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laughed at myself
While the tears rolled down
'Cause it's the world I have known
Oh, it's the world I know
Yeah, I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laughed at myself
While the tears rolled down
'Cause it's the world I have known
Oh, it's the world I know4Embed The World I Know Collective Soul Collective Soul grunge
