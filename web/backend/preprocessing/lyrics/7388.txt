Is there nothing left to keep myself awake?
To keep the walls from caving in
When all they ever do is try to bend and break?
Is there forgiveness in the end?

[Pre-Chorus]
I need relief, a failure's coming on
Just breathe in deep, it's taking far too long

[Chorus]
I had you in my grip, but you're starting to slip
Bring out the worst in me
And now it's come to end, I think I'm giving in
You set my demons free

[Verse 2]
It seems no matter where I look, it's always gone
With you, I know I'll never win
And it's hard to say where it went so wrong
And failed me in the end

[Pre-Chorus]
I need relief, a failure's coming on
Just breathe in deep, it's taking far too long
I need relief, this weakness carries on
Please, be a dream, or was it all along?

I had you in my grip, but you're starting to slip
Bring out the worst in me
And now it's come to end, I think I'm giving in

[Bridge]
It's better when you're with me, but that's better left unsaid
It's better when I'm empty, but I still let you in
It's better when you're with me, but that's better left unsaid
It's better when I'm empty, but I still let you in

[Chorus]
I had you in my grip, but you're starting to slip
Bring out the worst in me
And now it's come to end, I think I'm giving in
You set my demons free
I had you in my grip, but you're starting to slip
Bring out the worst in me

[Outro]
Please, won't you stay for me, don't ever let me be
You set my demons free7Embed The Worst In Me Bad Omens Bad Omens metalcore
