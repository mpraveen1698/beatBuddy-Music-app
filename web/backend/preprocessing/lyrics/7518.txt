1 ContributorCalling (Lose My Mind) [The Annual 2013 edit] (vocal radio) Lyrics[Ryan Tedder]
Can we freeze, come and surrender our rights and wrongs?
Can we just for a night let the stars decide where we belong?
Maybe heaven right now is a devil or angel away
That won't change
Together we vow that our colors will sparkle the faith
And I will find you
I will find you
I will reach you
Or I, I, I will lose my mind
Lose my mind
Lose my mind
Lose my mind
Lose my mind, yeah
I will lose my mind, yeah
Lose my mind, yeah
Maybe heaven right now is a devil or angel away
That won't change
Together we vow that our colors will sparkle the faith
And I will find you
I will find you
I will reach you
Or I, I, I will lose my mind
I will lose my mind, yeah
Lose my mind, yeahYou might also likeEmbed Calling (Lose My Mind) - Radio Edit Calling (Lose My Mind) Sebastian Ingrosso;Alesso;Ryan Tedder progressive-house
