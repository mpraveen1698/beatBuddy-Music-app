10 ContributorsArise (From Marvel’s ’Cloak & Dagger’) Lyrics[Verse 1: Taz]
Remember back in the day
When you taught me to live and I taught you to pray?
We went into battle together
No matter the weather, we never delayed
You gave me commands, I always obeyed
I never let you go astray, I
Never thought I'd see the day that
You would come up to betray me
Sick of playing silly games, you
Never loved me anyway, you
Should not have let me get away, 'cause
Now I'm hunting for my prey, I'm
Bigger, I'm better, my mind is a weapon
I won't ever let it be cheddar
Break me down and I'ma just get up
They ask me how I did it
I'ma just tell 'em I rose up

[Chorus: Taz]
I'm a survivor (I'm a survivor)
Fight for my life (Fight for my life)
Coming back stronger (coming back stronger)
I will arise (I will arise)
I'm a survivor (I'm a survivor)
Fight for my life (Fight for my life)
Coming back stronger (Coming back stronger)
I will arise

Staring at you from afar
Analyzing every scar
Asking myself how we got here
Remember this is who we are
I am not here for revenge
I did not come to make amends
Not here to repent for my sins
I just came here to win
I just came here to end
I just came here to fight
Show you everything you said I couldn't be
I became overnight
This for the blood, this is for the tears
This is for my pen and my plight
Two walked in, but only one of us is walking out of here tonight

[Chorus: Taz]
I'm a survivor (I'm a survivor)
Fight for my life (Fight for my life)
Coming back stronger (Coming back stronger)
I will arise (I will arise)
I'm a survivor (I'm a survivor)
Fight for my life (Fight for my life)
Coming back stronger (Coming back stronger)
I will arise1Embed Arise (From Marvel's "Cloak & Dagger") Arise (From Marvel's "Cloak & Dagger") The Seige alt-rock
