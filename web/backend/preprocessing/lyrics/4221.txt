4 ContributorsFalling Slowly Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was looking at you and you were looking at me
And then I asked you to dance until you wanted to leave
Then we went back to my house and I asked what do you think
You told me you think it's nice and if there’s something to drink
I told her I have some seltzers you want yellow or pink
She said it really don’t matter do you have any weed
I told her I got an eight but I ain’t smoke in two weeks
She told me I’m such a lightweight you’ll be higher than me

[Per-Chorus]
So then I rolled us a blunt she started kissing my neck
I thought that we’d probably fuck and wake up late in my bed
Until we started just talking having so much in common
Now my feelings are cautious ‘cause I know what it is

[Chorus]
I’m probably falling slowly
And you’re getting to know me I’m getting to know you
You’re falling slowly, this was not supposed to happen
We’re falling slowly
And you’re getting to know me I’m getting to know you
You’re falling slowly, this was not supposed to happen

[Verse 1]
Now we talk on the phone and it's like every night
I should be working on music but you’re calling my line
I told you fuck all the talking you should really just fly
You said okay I will I’ll probably be there in five
You showed up late in a sweatshirt and some leggings on tight
You ask if I have some cups because you stopped and got wine
You said I got us some red because I didn’t want white
You cuddled up in my arms and you were holding on tight
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I started moving my hands you started kissing my neck
We went back to my bed and I remember you said
That there's nobody better I could fuck you forever
Tried to think it whatever but I felt it again

[Chorus]
I started falling slowly
And you’re getting to know me I’m getting to know you
You’re falling slowly, this was not supposed to happen
We’re falling slowly
And you’re getting to know me I’m getting to know you
You’re falling slowly, this was not supposed to happenEmbed Falling Slowly Falling Slowly Vwillz sad
