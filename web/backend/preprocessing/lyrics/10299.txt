Somehow I woke up out in Beverly, fucked up
Smelling like that bourbon
How'd I end up alone? I'm not certain
Yeah the girl's impolite in the club every night
That's how it goes when you Hollywood perfect

[Pre-Drop]
Hollywood perfect
That's how it goes when you Hollywood perfect

[Drop]
Hollywood perfect
Hollywood-
Hollywood perfect

[Verse]
Ain't got no place to call my own
Feels like I'm better off alone
So sad inside and hopeless
These Hollywood hoes nevеr notice

[Pre-Chorus]
When I fall down, I can't get back up
You'rе gone, girl I miss you
When I fall down, I can't get back up
You're gone, girl I miss you

Somehow I woke up out in Beverly, fucked up
Smelling like that bourbon
How'd I end up alone? I'm not certain
Yeah the girl's impolite in the club every night
That's how it goes when you Hollywood perfect
Go

Hollywood perfect
That's how it goes when you Hollywood perfect

[Chorus]
Somehow I woke up out in Beverly, fucked up
Smelling like that bourbon
How'd I end up alone, I'm not certain
Yeah the girl's impolite in the club every night
Somehow I woke up out in Beverly, fucked up
Smelling like that bourbon
How'd I end up alone? I'm not certain
Yeah the girl's impolite in the club every night
That's how it goes when you Hollywood perfect
