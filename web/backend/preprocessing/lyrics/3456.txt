6 Contributorsâ€‹i looked into your eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl
Being by your side through everything's been hurting
And the scars you left on me, love, they're no burden
I never wanna lose you from my heart
Are you still in my heart?

[Chorus]
Wait
Where did you go?
When you said it was over
Did that mean that you'd forget about the time
When we found our shooting star?
And I looked into your eyes
And you looked back at mine

[Verse 2]
I'm lost in this world, I hate it
You're gone, but you're still my favorite
I hate when I let these feelings out
I wish you would want me
I wish you would love me
(I wish you would)

[Chorus]
Wait
Where did you go?
When you said it was over
Did that mean that you'd forget about the time
When we found our shooting star?
And I looked into your eyes
And you looked back at mine
You might also like[Outro]
Ooh, you save me
Ooh, you save me
Ooh, you save me
It's like, ooh, you save meEmbed i looked into your eyes i looked into your eyes Sky McCreery sad
