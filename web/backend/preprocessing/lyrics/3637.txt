All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A
California dreaming on such a winter's day

[Verse]
Stopped in to a church I passed along the way
Well I got down on my knees (Got down on my knees)
And I pretend to pray (And I pretend to pray)
You know the preacher likes the cold (The preacher likes the cold)
He knows I'm gonna stay (Knows I'm gonna stay)
California dreaming
California dreaming on such a winter's day

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
All the leaves are brown (All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray (And the sky is gray)
I've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day (On a winter's day)
I'd be safe and warm (I'd be safe and warm)
If I was in L.A. (If I was in L.A.)
California dreaming
California dreaming on such a winter's day
