And they say, "Hello, hello, it's your time to get up"
Hotel mini-bar
Sound so sick and fed up
90s' movie star, million classic cars
Rub your lucky charms 'cause that's not who we are

[Verse 1]
I'll be here all week
Riding like the funfair, we speed down to the beach
Brown hair with the brown eyes with the small size to her feet
Skate around by the coast, dipping your toes into the sea
Smoking on cigarettes, smoking that Juul flavour
It's peach ice, be nice
No, I'm not the one no who likes
Three stripes, she likes hating whеn I'm right, it's cold
He's like flea bitеs getting all over your
Skin-tight, bleach-dye hair

[Chorus]
And they say, "Hello, hello, it's your time to get up"
Hotel mini-bar
Sound so sick and fed up
90s' movie star, million classic cars
Rub your lucky charms 'cause that's not who we are
You might also like[Verse 2]
Fuck around, make a hundred grand just to spend it all on some drugs
Grow my hair, dye a little bit, just to shave it off for the fun
Ask my friends what they think of it
Just some angry smiles and some shrugs
Boring kid, I'm a home boy, I already fucked with the clubs
But that's where you find your love
And she'll think you're in love
'Cause she into the gym boys who know they look pretty buff
They're tall, petty and mugs
I'm small, sweaty, untouched
They're more 'fuck with your life'
I'm more 'fuck with your heart'

[Chorus]
And they say, "Hello, hello, it's your time to get up"
Hotel mini-bar
Sound so sick and fed up
90s' movie star, million classic cars
Rub your lucky charms 'cause that's not who we are1Embed hello hello! hello hello! Yxngxr1 sad
