11 ContributorsKoolaid Lyrics[Verse 1]
Running through the jungle
Way back in '78
Here's the story of the people's temple
And my great escape
Communing with a madman
The promise of utopia
White nights, suicide drills
Shades of things to come

He said

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We're gonna mix it up
Add the cyanide
Then we'll drink it up
You're gonna feel so fine

I said

[Chorus 1]
Don't drink the Koolaid
Don't taste the holy water
Don't drink the Koolaid
No matter what the preacher - what the preacher says

The day of disaster struck
The murders did begin
His sheep drank it willingly
While mothers force fed their kin
33 escaped this hell
Some would call it fate
That's how I lived to tell the tale
About the day he mixed the grape

He said

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We're gonna mix it up
Add the cyanide
You better drink it up
You're gonna get so high

[Chorus 2]
Don't drink the Koolaid
Don't taste the holy water
Don't drink the Koolaid
No matter what the preacher says

Don't drink the Koolaid
Don't you down the holy water
Don't drink the Koolaid
Don't believe a word he says
[Verse 3]
Most of the congregation
900 dead
Jones found his own way out
A bullet to the head

[Chorus 3]
Don't drink the Koolaid
Don't you taste the holy water
Don't drink the Koolaid
No matter what the preacher says

Don't drink the Koolaid
I won't down the holy water
Don't drink the Koolaid
No matter what the preacher - what the preacher saysEmbed Koolaid The Rise of Chaos Accept heavy-metal
