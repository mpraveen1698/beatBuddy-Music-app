21 ContributorsIâ€™d Rather Go Blind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "Cry Girl" (Cry, cry)
When I saw you and that girl, walking around, ooh

[Chorus]
I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Than to see you walk away from me child, and all

[Verse 2]
So you see, I love you so much
That I don't want to watch you leave me baby
Most of all, I just don't, I just don't want to be free no

I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips now baby
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah

[Chorus Outro]
And baby, baby, I would rather, I would rather be blind boy
Than to see you walk away, see you walk away from me, yeah
Baby, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind nowYou might also like7Embed I'd Rather Go Blind Tell Mama Etta James blues
