4 ContributorsYou Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Baby, standin' here with you
With your arms around my shoulders
We're dancin' with the moon
And baby, it feels just like a dream
When I whisper that I love you
And you say it back to me

[Chorus]
I got you, ooh, ooh
For the rest of my days
In the sun of Sunday morning
Or the pouring rain
I got you, ooh, ooh
For the rest of my life
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright
'Cause I got you

[Post-Chorus]
You, you, and only you
You and only you
I got you, you, and only you
You and only you

Baby, lookin' in your eyes
It's like we're in slow motion, just you and me tonight
And baby, you lean in for a kiss
And I know, and I know, and I know that it don't better than this

[Chorus]
'Cause I got you, ooh, ooh
For the rest of my days
In the sun of Sunday morning
Or the pouring rain
I got you, ooh, ooh
For the rest of my life
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I got you
You, you, and only you
You and only you
I got you, you, and only you
You and only you

[Bridge]
I got forever
And I got all I'll ever need
'Cause I got you, ooh, ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
I got you, ooh, ooh (You, you, and only you)
For the rest of my days
In the sun of Sunday morning
Or the pouring rain (Pouring rain)
I got you, ooh, ooh (You, you, and only you)
For the rest of my life (My life)
And if all else goes wrong, baby
I'll be alright
