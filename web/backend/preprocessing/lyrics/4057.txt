10 ContributorsLean On Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you're feeling down and all alone
And you got no where to go
Lets have a little conversation
'Cause every time I'm feeling low
I swinged it up till I'm good to go
It don't have to be complication
If your smi-i-ile had been washed away
If you cry-aye-aye almost every day
You'll always have a friend in me

[Chorus]
When you're lost
When you're scared
When you're broke beyond repair
You can lean on me
You can lean on me
When you're sad and insecure
You can't take it any more
You can lean on me
You can lean on me

[Verse 2]
If you feel like no one cares
And the winds are blowing everywhere
Like you got no destination
You know you can always be yourself
You can always call for help, yeah
And we will find your inspiration
My friend
You might also like[Chorus]
When you're lost
When you're scared
When you're broke beyond repair
You can lean on me
You can lean on me
When you're sad and insecure
You can't take it any more
You can lean on me
You can lean on me

[Bridge]
Lean on me
Lean on
La, La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la
You can lean on me (La-la-la-la-la, la)

[Verse 3]
When ever you're down on your knees and in sorrow
And thinking there ain't no tomorrow
You can lean on me
Lean on, lean on, lean on me
[Chorus]
When you're lost
When you're scared (La, La-la-la)
When you're broke beyond repair (La-la-la ), (La-la-la )
You can lean on me (La-la-la)
You can lean on me (La-la-la-la-la, la)
When you're sad and insecure (La, La-la-la), (La-la-la )
You can't take it any more (La-la-la )
You can lean on me (La-la-la-la-la, la)
You can lean on me (La-la-la-la-la, la)
Lean on me
Lean on

[Outro]
La, La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la
You can lean on me (La-la-la-la-la, la)
Lean on me
(La, La-la-la)
(La-la-la)
(La-la-la-la)
