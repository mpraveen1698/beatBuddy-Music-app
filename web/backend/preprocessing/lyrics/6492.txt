5 ContributorsLa Lune Lyrics[Verse 1]
Breaking my back in the heart of this land
Feet above water and softened in sand
I could have wanted any part of this

[Verse 2]
But I find the heat is too harsh on the skin
Drowning in light need the cold to sink into my soul
My soul

[Chorus]
Ignore signs of change, no more
I come back again, I am flawed

[Verse 3]
Swallow me whole with the moon on my back
One side is pink and the other is black
I'm good at hiding in the dead and grey

[Verse 4]
But time after time I've been people I'm not
Places we go to, are all that we've got
So why don't we go? So why don't we go?
I'll never know

[Chorus]
Ignore signs of change, no more
I come back again, I am flawedYou might also like5Embed La Lune Writing of Blues and Yellows (Deluxe Version) Billie Marten british
