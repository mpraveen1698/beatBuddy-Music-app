Grind in the winter just to shine in the summer
Heard you say you 'bout that action
But I know that you a runner
Count cash under bulletproof glass in the hummer
White dope in my coat make your throat go numb

[Chorus]
Grind in the winter just to shine in the summer
Heard you say you 'bout that action
But I know that you a runner
Count cash under bulletproof glass in the hummer
White dope in my coat make your throat go numb
Is this real life?
Gettin' money, you do anything you feel like
Ain't no tellin' where I'm going
Count a blessin' when I see her undressin' in the morning
What it feel like?

[Verse]
Keep it goin', yeah I see now what I'm doin' is workin'
Used to get caught lyin', now she cryin' for certain
Even back when my pockets was hurtin'
You were stayin' by my side, let me know was it worth it?
Keep in mind, never said I was perfect
Even when I'm dead in your head, I'll be lurkin'
See me lookin' through the blinds when you open the curtains
When I'm gone, you can keep me alive
You might also like[Chorus]
Grind in the winter just to shine in the summer
Heard you say you 'bout that action
But I know that you a runner
Count cash under bulletproof glass in the hummer
White dope in my coat make your throat go numb
Is this real life?
Gettin' money, you do anything you feel like
Ain't no tellin' where I'm going
Count a blessin' when I see her undressin' in the morning
What it feel like?

[Outro]
Keep it goin', yeah I see now what I'm doin' is workin'
Used to get caught lyin', now she cryin' for certain
Even back when my pockets was hurtin'
You were stayin' by my side, let me know was it worth it?
Keep in mind, never said I was perfect
Even when I'm dead in your head, I'll be lurkin'
See me lookin' through the blinds when you open the curtains
When I'm gone, you can keep me alive29Embed Bulletproof Bulletproof Brennan Savage emo
