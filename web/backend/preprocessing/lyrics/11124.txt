6 ContributorsHoneybrains Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every day, walk the line like I'm walkin' on a wire
Takin' my time, but my blood is on fire
Down to the marrow, from a shudder to a shock wave
Holdin' my ground, lookin' for a new escape

[Pre-Chorus]
When I am chokin', distorted and broken
Crawlin' out the same ditch, lookin' for the off switch

[Chorus]
Guess I better quit and find another way
Before I get stuck in my honeybrains
Caught up in the shadow of the vicious cycle
Shaking off the same old headaches

[Verse 2]
Dodging cracks in the ice, gettin' thinner by the hour
Down on the ropes and my blood is on fire
Thеre's no rock bottom, rock bottom
It's just a matter of when you'rе gonna give up diggin'
Not drownin', not drownin'
Just tryin' to keep my head up above

[Pre-Chorus]
When I am chokin', distorted and broken
Crawlin' out the same ditch, lookin' for the off switch

Guess I better quit and find another way
Before I get stuck in my honeybrains
Caught up in the shadow of the vicious cycle
Shaking off the same old headaches
Guess I better quit and find another way
Before I get stuck in my honeybrains
Caught up in the shadow of the vicious cycle
Shaking off the same old headaches

[Bridge]
My mind is shackled to the wrist of a stone cold saboteur (Hey)
But it's bound, so they miss, wish I could shoot the messenger

[Pre-Chorus]
When I am chokin', distorted and broken
Crawlin' out the same ditch, lookin' for the off switch

[Chorus]
Guess I better quit and find another way
Before I get stuck in my honeybrains
Caught up in the shadow of the vicious cycle
Shaking off the same old headaches

[Pre-Chorus]
When I am chokin', distorted and broken
Crawlin' out the same ditch, lookin' for the off switch
[Chorus]
Guess I better quit and find another way
Before I get stuck in my honeybrains1Embed Honeybrains Honeybrains Royal Blood garage
