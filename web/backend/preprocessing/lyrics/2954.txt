16 ContributorsI Donâ€™t Wanna Be Okay Without You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm saying things I don't believe
And your love casts its shadow on the things I do
And I can hear so clearly all the words I wish I'd said
You're stuck in my head

[Chorus]
But I only think of you
Will we be together soon?
I'm thrown to the wayside
You're planted in my mind
But I don't wanna be okay without you

[Verse 2]
Now I can't find the words to say
That'll be the perfect balance between loud and clear
And I can hear so well, your lovely voice inside my head
Saying you love me

[Chorus]
But I only think of you
Will we be together soon?
I'm thrown to the wayside
You're planted in my mind
But I don't wanna be okay without you

Will we be together soon?
I'm thrown to the wayside
You're planted in my mind
But I don't wanna be okay without you
Without you
No, I don't wanna be okay without you5Embed I Don't Wanna Be Okay Without You Live in Peter's Attic Charlie Burg indie-pop
