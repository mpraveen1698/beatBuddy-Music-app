In the dark, come out and play
We are its child—, here to stay
Running through, hungry for stray'
No invitat—, take me away
I'm not cruel, still what you see
Club to club, city with me
Hungry for life, -out your pity
I don't want, you give it

[Chorus: Matt Van Schie]
Still can't say she won't start up
Still can't say she won't start up a fight
You go the city
'Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait

[Verse 2: Matt Van Schie]
In the dark, killer await'
To kill a life, life you make
You do another, death can live
Just keep on dan—, movie you're in (I'm not cruel)
Smell of your sweat, lures me in
Your heart—, things to me
Running feet, through my blood
My ghost inside you soon will be
You might also like[Chorus: Matt Van Schie]

Still can't say she won't start up a fight
You go city
'Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait

[Outro: Matt Van Schie]
Now it's over, you've taken your life
Dark grows thin and left to hide
I don't regret it, but it's sad anyway
Now we're both dead and so scared of the black
This life of games and diligent trust
It's the things we do and the things we must
I'm now tired of being cussed
So go sleep forever end to dust25Embed Vanished Crystal Castles Crystal Castles hardcore
