8 ContributorsPatience Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missing you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
You set my mind at ease
There ain't no doubt you're in my heart now

[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow, it will work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow, we will come together fine
All we need is just a little patience

[Verse 2]
I sit here on the stairs
I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
Sometimes it gets so tense
I can't speed up the time
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider

[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow and things will be just fine
If you and I just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time, 'cause the lights are shining bright
You and I got what it takes to make it
You might also like[Bridge]
I've been walking these streets at night
Just trying to get it right
Hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like being stuck in a crowd

And the streets don't change, but maybe the names
You know I ain't got time for the game
'Cause I need you
Yeah, I need you

[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow, it will work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow, we will come together fine
All we need is just a little patience1Embed Patience Patience Chris Cornell grunge
