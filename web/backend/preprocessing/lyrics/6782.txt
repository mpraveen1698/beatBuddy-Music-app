We've been dancing for so long under the stars
I feel as the grass will cut through my skin
All the pills we take have seem to prolong
Our existence but I don't feel alright
I would rather be alone than have you
Every time I speak I feel myself fall
Do you wish to find the truth in my lies
Sorry darlin' there's no truth here
No

[Verse 2]
It's just the two of us, my dear
Listen to me don't you hear
I only fell for you
I only fell for you baby
Don't you let them see your fear
Promise not to shed a tear
I only fell for you
I only fell for you babyYou might also like16Embed Sunflower Feelings Sunflower Feelings Kuzu Mellow sad
