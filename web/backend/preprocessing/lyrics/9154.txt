11 ContributorsDigital World Lyrics("There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.")

[Verse 1: Henrik Englund]
We spin the world like a pinball machine
We have thoughts of a life in abundance
Day and night we wish movies were real
And what's behind the screen is our entrance

[Bridge: Elize Ryd & Jake E]
I'm like a satellite, transmitting different eras
I am the voice of the next generation
Completely digital, create synthetic auras
Start a revolution now

[Chorus: Elize Ryd & Jake E]
You will never have to cry, cause the future is sold
You can never die and you'll never grow old
Oh, but everything surrounding you is digital
Never break the mold, you do as you're told
Freedom is for sale if you give them control
(Oh) Erase, return in a digital world

[Verse 2: Henrik Englund]
I know it feels like you're part of a dream
You can fly and fight wars without judgement
You respawn and mistakes will repeal
But you will always be searching for an answer
You might also like[Bridge: Elize Ryd & Jake E]
I'm like a satellite, transmitting different eras
I am the voice of the next generation
Completely digital, create synthetic auras
Start a revolution now

[Chorus: Elize Ryd & Jake E]
You will never have to cry, cause the future is sold
You can never die and you'll never grow old
Oh, but everything surrounding you is digital
Never break the mold, you do as you're told
Freedom is for sale if you give them control
(Oh) Erase, return in a digital world

[Breakdown: Henrik Englund]
Start a revolution now!
Start a revolution now!

[Chorus: Elize Ryd & Jake E]
You will never have to cry, cause the future is sold
You can never die and you'll never grow old
Oh, but everything surrounding you is digital
Never break the mold, you do as you're told
Freedom is for sale if you give them control
(Oh) Erase, return in a digital world3Embed Digital World MASSIVE ADDICTIVE Amaranthe goth
