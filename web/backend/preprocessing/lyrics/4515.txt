Now, what have we here?
Are you sure about this?
I was once grateful to you
But if this is our fate, so be it
You leave me no choice

[Chorus]
Yuh, I woke up, I chose violence
Choke up, these bitches silent
Get fucked, nowhere to hide and
No luck, I must oblige
I came to bludgeon all you pussies, you could call it what you want
I been feelin' kinda manic, I might kill 'em just for fun
Collecting heads, think you're better off dead
I could lie and say it isn't personal, I'm seein' red
You're the target, I'm the missile
Don't worry, they won't miss you
I think I got some problems, turning nothin' to an issue
Now I'll solve it with my–

[Verse]
I popped off, it's been a little borin'
All my enemies are hiding out, it gets annoyin'
Guess I gotta sniff 'em out, I'm searchin' 'til the mornin'
Finally found the prey, okay, so now's the day for mournin'
I used to want to kill myself, but now I only kill the snakes
Bitch, don't say you know me 'cause you've always been a fake
I been posted in my dungeon, got the tools to make you vanish
I been itchin' for destruction, I might take over the planet, uh
White knuckle blade singin', "Where you at, bitch?"
They open the fuckin' gates, I came out with my heart ripped
I put 'em in a body bag, yeah, you know that's my shit
I don't fuck with you now, it's time to put you in a ditch
Okay, bodies on bodies, I cannot stop, I got a problem
Bitch, I'm awful, I got it, just fuckin' drop me in a coffin
I'm just talkin' shit, this is what you wanted, right?
No more Mr. Nice Guy, you'll be sayin', "Bye-bye"
