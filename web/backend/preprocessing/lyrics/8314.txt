Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don’t touch lips, not an issue
I don’t wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to
Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don’t touch lips, not an issue
I don’t wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to

[Verse 1]
One time, maybe twice in
One night, it’s alright we’re
Both alone so go together
Kiss my wounds but not forever
Fuck around, feel my heartbeat
Fallin' down in the backseat
Fill me up 'cause I'm runnin' on empty
And it’s fine if we’re only pretending

[Pre-Chorus]
Three months is all we got
Try not to fall in love
Don’t think I've had enough but I said it’s fine by me

[Chorus]
Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don’t touch lips, not an issue
I don’t wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to
Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don’t touch lips, not an issue
I don’t wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to
You might also like[Verse 2]
Said we goin' bye bye in a minute
I'ma chill on the Southside, caught feelings
When the leaves turn, no more favors
Nice to meet ya, catch you later, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Three months is all we got
Try not to fall in love
Said I ain’t had enough but I think that’s fine by me

[Chorus]
Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don’t touch lips, not an issue
I don’t wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to
Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don’t touch lips, not an issue
I don’t wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to

[Outro]

Fill me up 'cause I'm runnin' on empty

And it’s fine if we’re only pretending)5Embed summer skeletons keshi chill
