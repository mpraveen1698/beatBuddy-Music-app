4 Contributors​​you’d never know Lyrics[Verse 1]
You'd never know
I was fighting for my life eight months ago
I shut the door and covered the windows
'Cause the sunlight hurt my eyes
I couldn't even go outside for so, so long

[Verse 2]
And you couldn't tell
But the inside of my head was a living hell
I tried my best explaining how it felt
But nobody ever understood
Doctor said that everything looks good
So I blamed myself

[Chorus]
I don't think I'd ever been so lonely
Didn't know if I would make it out
The dead of the winter of my life
In the middle of the summertime
And it still haunts me now

[Verse 3]
But you'd never know
That it took me months to step outside alone
'Cause my body still gets tense when I walk home
Past the spot where it all went dark
It's like a movie flashing back in parts
That cuts deep and slow
(Ohh)
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't think I'd ever been so lonely
Didn't know if I would make it out
The dead of the winter of my life
In the middle of the summertime
And it still haunts me now

[Bridge]
Everyone said
You look fine from the outside
But in my mind I was upside down and screaming
What the hell is wrong with me? (Oh-oh-oh)
Tryna make it make sense, making my head spin
Now I pray to forget 'cause I'm still here screaming
What the hell is wrong with me?

[Outro]
