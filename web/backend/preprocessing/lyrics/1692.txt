I'm holdin' on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what you say
But I just can't make a sound, no
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around and say

[Chorus]
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

[Post-Chorus]
Too late
Oh, too late

[Verse 2]
I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you
Oh, and I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new, yeah, yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turnin' blue and you say
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you, but I'm afraid

[Chorus]
It's too late to apologize
It's too late

I said it's too late to apologize, yeah (Too late)
