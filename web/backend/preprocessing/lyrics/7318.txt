Look at me, I will never pass for a perfect bride
Or a perfect daughter
Can it be I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see that if I were truly to be myself
I would break my family's heart
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow, I cannot hide
Who I am, though I've tried
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
When will my reflection show who I am inside?See Lea Salonga LiveGet tickets as low as $56You might also like8Embed Reflection Mulan (Original Soundtrack) Lea Salonga;Disney show-tunes
