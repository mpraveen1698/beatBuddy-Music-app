Turn the music up
'Cause I don't wanna think
I don't wanna think about the room I'm in
If my eyes stay shut
Then I don't have to see
I don't have to see how everybody's

[Pre-Chorus]
Got someone they're taking home
I don't wanna sound so cynical, but I

[Chorus]
Wanna fall in love like all my friends
God, they look so happy
And I know I can be
I don't mind my empty bed
But sometimes I get lonely
Want someone to show me how to
Fix a fight, kiss good night, hold me tight
I wanna fall in love like all my friends
Fall in love like all my friends

[Verse 2]

Someone in our youth
Somebody who can make us feel like

[Chorus]
Wanna fall in love like all my friends
God, they look so happy
And I know I can be
I don't mind my empty bed
But sometimes I get lonely
Want someone to show me how to
Fix a fight, kiss good night, hold me tight
I wanna fall in love like all my friends
Fall in love like all my friends

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, fall in love like all my friends
Ooh, ooh, fall in love like all my friends

[Chorus]
Wanna fall in love like all my friends, oh
And I don't mind my empty bed
But sometimes I get lonely
Want someone to show me how to
Fix a fight, kiss good night, hold me tight
I wanna fall in love like all my friends
Fall in love like all my friends1Embed Like All My Friends Like All My Friends Francis Karel singer-songwriter
