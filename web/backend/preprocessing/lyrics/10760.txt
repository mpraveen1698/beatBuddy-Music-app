11 ContributorsEGOT Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah (Yeah)
Woo, yeah
Mmm, woah, look

[Verse 1]
I used to call this a hobby
But now all the hours I put in, it's more of a job
I'm never calling in sick or be thinking of packing my stuff up when it's 4 o'clock
Stay independent, I don't want a label
They calling me up but I don't want a boss
Until my catalog making 6 figures a month off of streaming, I don't wanna stop
I'm not gonna stop, yeah, look
I got a flow for every occasion, I got some goals I'm steadily chasing
I got some foes like Freddy and Jason, woah
Quit acting like everybody's in love with you, like there's only one of you
Buddy I promise you I've seen a couple you's, and I ain't talking W's
I got some friends who talking that trash all behind my back, they saying I suck
They the same ones who in my DM's, they showing me love, can't make this stuff up
That's why I'm paying no mind to things that they all gotta say when I'm dropping
I do not know anybody who's winning who's taking the time to leave negative comments

[Chorus]
I'm in control, just show me the ropes
I know how to steer
I keep it quiet, I don't hear the laughs
I don't hear the hate, I don't hear the cheers
Don't need to smoke, I don't need to drink
But do what you do, whatever you feel
Switching it up, I do what I want
They hearing the beat, but this not a drill
No this not a-

Yeah, used to hang around with some kids who had no goals
Didn't ever wanna grow old, we stayed still, never showed growth
Feeling like I'm on a stone road, with a row boat, had no hope
So nowadays when they see me, tell me that I've changed, I just say "I hope so"
Took a detour, had to see more
Missed the opportunities knocking, now it's C4 on these doors
Blowing up and I ain't ever knocking, going up and I ain't ever stopping
Growing up I always knew that I was meant to be something
I leave nothing on the table now, no second option
Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony, yes you know that I need those
I know I prolly sound a little cocky when I'm saying that I can reach those
I been hot since '97, that's word to the man Ebro
What I'm trying to say is, you can't spell EGOT without a little ego
No tension on cloud nine, I ate beats since 7th grade
In the 6, they be giving high fives
They can't reach when I levitate
Got foresight for my third eye
No second place, I already won
And they know it now
You should check your numbers, cause they going down
Nah wait, hold up, I ain't done with it, brand new flows, no dust in it
Five-foot seven, might dunk with it, like what physics?
Ball hog and I run with it, no cold feet, just jump in it
I'm all in, no bluff in it, my words curse, no cuss in it
My first words was "Come get it" (Yeah)
[Chorus]
I'm in control, just show me the ropes
I know how to steer
I keep it quiet, I don't hear the laughs
I don't hear the hate, I don't hear the cheers
Don't need to smoke, I don't need to drink
But do what you do, whatever you feel
Switching it up, I do what I want
They hearing the beat, but this not a drill
No this not a-2Embed EGOT EGOT Connor Price sad
