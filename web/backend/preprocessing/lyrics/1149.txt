Sun kissed my face
Wishing for the real thing
Lonely and out of place
When I don't have you with me
Does your heart say the same
On all these nights alone? Yeah
Or is it just me
Hoping you'll come home?

[Pre-Chorus: Jonah]
'Cause I don't know if I can make you happy
No matter what the odds, I'm gonna try
A million miles away, I feel you with me
For now, our love will live inside my mind, so

[Chorus: Zach & Jack]
Don't wake me up in the middle of the night
'Cause I finally found you
I feel your love every time I close my eyes
'Causе I finally found you
When the times arе hardest, I'll find you in the darkness
You're a dream and that is enough (That is enough), yeah
Don't wake me up in the middle of the night
'Cause I finally found you

[Verse 2: Daniel, Corbyn & Both]
Summer days so far away
Only see 'em in the rearview, yeah (Rearview, yeah)
How will I hold you again
To make you feel at home?

[Pre-Chorus: Jonah & Corbyn]
'Cause I don't know if I can make you happy
No matter what the odds, I'm gonna try
A million miles away, I feel you with me (I feel you with me)
For now, our love will live inside my mind, so

[Chorus: Zach, Jack, Zach & Jonah]
Don't wake me up in the middle of the night
