3 ContributorsHurt Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't cry anymore and it haunts me
I miss the emotional frenzy of back and forth and messing up
You're so good it's kind of scary
Not used to someone caring quite this much, so I fuck it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're lying at your place
I'm lying to your face
I know I said I'm fine but

[Chorus]
I'd rather start a fight, scream and cry, make you hate me
Then pretend that it's alright, one more night, I can't take it and if
I'm between losing you and losing me
Baby I would rather be, rather be, rather be hurt again
Hurt again

[Verse 2]
We move at different paces
Sometimes I need more space
Then you could ever give me
Too good at being lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're lying at your place
I'm lying to your face
I know I said I'm fine but
You might also like[Chorus]
I'd rather start a fight, scream and cry, make you hate me
Then pretend that it's alright, one more night, I can't take it and if
I'm between losing you and losing me
Baby I would rather be, rather be, rather be hurt again
Hurt again
Hurt again
Hurt again

[Outro]
I'm between losing you or losing me
Baby I would rather be, rather be, rather be
