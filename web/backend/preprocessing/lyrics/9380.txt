6 ContributorsWait Lyrics[Verse 1]
Something's wrong
Trying to conquer these fears I thought were gone
And it's been so long
I'm dying to live in a world I don't belong

[Chorus]
I can't wait for someone to hear me
And wait for someone to touch me
And wait forever to be told
I'm forever alone
I can't wait for someone to feel me
And wait for someone to heal me
And wait forever to be told
I'm forever alone

[Verse 2]
On my own
I've shown myself what it means to be alone
And the tears I've cried have washed away
All the scars of my disguise

[Chorus]
I can't wait for someone to hear me
And wait for someone to touch me
And wait forever to be told
I'm forever alone
I can't wait for someone to feel me
And wait for someone to heal me
And wait forever to be told
I'm forever alone
I'm forever alone
I'm forever alone
I'm forever alone

I, I'm not waiting here this time

[Chorus]
I can't wait for someone to hear me
And wait for someone to touch me
And wait forever to be told
I'm forever alone
I can't wait for someone to feel me
And wait for someone to heal me
And wait forever to be told
I'm forever alone2Embed Wait Two Earshot industrial
