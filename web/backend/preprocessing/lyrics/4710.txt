37 ContributorsThe NeverEnding Story Lyrics[Verse 1: Limahl]
Turn around
Look at what you see
In her face
The mirror of your dreams

[Chorus: Limahl & Beth Andersen]
Make believe I'm everywhere
I'm hidden in the lines
Written on the pages
Is the answer to a never-ending story
(Ah)

[Verse 2: Limahl]
Reach the stars
Fly a fantasy
Dream a dream
And what you see will be

[Chorus: Limahl and Beth Andersen]
Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow
Is the answer to a never-ending story
(Ah)

Show no fear
For she may fade away
In your hand
The birth of a new day

[Chorus: Beth Andersen]
Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow
Is the answer to a never-ending story
Ah
