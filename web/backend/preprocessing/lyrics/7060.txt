Found my corner of the matrix
No, I never thought I'd say this
But it turns out all my friends are famous
So concerned with reputation

[Pre-Chorus: Chloe George]
Why, every night, do I try assimilating?
Not gonna lie, getting tired of this simulation

[Chorus: Chloe George]
I'm a ticking time bomb, looking for my ride home
Flicking through my iPhone, no destination
Don't care about your homies pretending that they know me
I don't got time for phonies or validation
Get fucked up every Thursday, drink like it's your birthday
So obsessed with first place, oh, oh
Yeah, I'm a ticking time bomb, looking for my ride home
Flicking through my iPhone, no destination

[Verse 2: Drew Taggart]
I guess I'll stay on this vibration
I don't need your reciprocation
'Cause it turns out love is condensation
I keep it moving on 'cause I'm impatient

[Interlude: Chloe George]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
