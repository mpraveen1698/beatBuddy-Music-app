[Verse: Childish Gambino]
Watching haters wonder why
Gambino got the game locked (Yeah?)
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok (Yeah?)
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP
Bino so insensitive, she askin' "Why you say that?!"
I'm chillin' (Yeah), real nigga feelin'
Rich kid, asshole paint me as a villain (Ma!)
Still spitting that cash flow, DJ Khaled
I got a penthouse on both coasts, pH balance
Real nigga, I rep those
Why though? 'Cause I said so
Hip deep in that Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo (What)
You faker than some Sweet'N Low (Why?)
Yeah, you got some silverware
But really are you eating though? (Yeah)
Are you eating though?
Nigga, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know
Never catching cases, why they faces look so E-M-O?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a pianoYou might also like1Embed ON TOP ON TOP The Girl Next Door;WMD sad
