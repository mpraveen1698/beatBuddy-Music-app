5 ContributorsBreathe Lyrics[Verse]
Sometimes I get nervous
What will they say, what will happen?
Ooh, what will I become?
It's getting late
The moon is full, the wolves begin to cry again
Say that you'll be there for me
For me
'Cause this story's about to breathe, to breathe
To breathe, to breathe
Breathe, oh
Breathe
