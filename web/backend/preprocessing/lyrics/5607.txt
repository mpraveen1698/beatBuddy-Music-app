When I was young, I thought the world of you
You were all that I wanted then
It faded and I never saw you again
But I won't forget the love we had

[Chorus]
Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side
Don't let me go
Stay with me still
I've missed you so

[Verse 2]
When I was young, I thought the world of you
I was dumb to let you drift away
And though I guess it had to come to an end
No one else could have the love we shared

[Chorus]
Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side
And my heart goes
Out to you
Wherever you are
