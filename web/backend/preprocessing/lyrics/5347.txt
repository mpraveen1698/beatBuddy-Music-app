8 ContributorsNot So Bad Lyrics[Intro]
My tea is gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window

[Verse]
My tea is gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Ba-ad,ba-ad
And I can't see at all
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

[Chorus]
And I can't see at all
I can't see at all
My tea is gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window

It reminds me that it's not so bad

My tea is gone cold, I'm wondering why

The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all

And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
