Have no fear
For when I'm alone
I'll be better off
Than I was before
I've got this life
I'll be around to grow
Who I was before
I cannot recall

[Chorus]
Long nights allow
Me to feel I'm falling
I am falling
The lights go out
Let me feel I'm falling
I am falling safely to
The ground
Ah

[Verse 2]
I'll take this soul
That's inside me now
Like a brand new friend
I'll forever know
I've got this life
And the will to show
I will always be
Better than before
You might also like[Chorus]
Long nights allow
Me to feel I'm falling
I am falling
The lights go out
Let me feel I'm falling
I am falling safely to
The ground
