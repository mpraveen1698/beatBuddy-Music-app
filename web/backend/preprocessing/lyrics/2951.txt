16 ContributorsYou Are the Right One Lyrics[Verse 1]
You were the right way
I was just waiting ' for you to look at me
Is there a wrong time
Baby, I'm guessing
Just let me know

[Verse 2]
Well, it's been a long time
Since you've been lonely
So what will I do
You are the right one
And I'm just the boy who is looking at you

[Bridge]
Peut-être une prochaine fois, au détour d'un bar
So what will I do
Avec quatre grammes dans l'sang
À plus mec, bonne soirée

[Verse 3]
I tried the wrong way
I was just guessing, biding my time
You are the only one I can picture by my sideYou might also like10Embed You Are the Right One Naked All the Time Sports soul
