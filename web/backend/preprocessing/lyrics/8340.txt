I can feel you, I can hear you howling in my bones
There's an evil lurking in the dark (There's an evil lurkin' in the dark)
Ever shifting, skin is ripping as you take control
I can't tell where you end and where I start
(There's an evil lurkin' in the dark)

[Pre-Chorus]
A ferocious diagnosis, under moonlit hands
Will the man become the monster or the monster become man?

[Chorus]
I could be up all night, but I'm paralyzed
When the creature comes alive
'Cause it's fight or fright in the full moonlight
You can run, but you can't hide
I could be honest, I could be human
I could become the silver bullet in your head
But no one can break my heart like I can

[Post-Chorus]
Werewolf

[Verse 2]
Bleed the neon from the bite marks ever bittersweet
Smile for the camera but don't flash your teeth
(Everybody loves a mystery)
Let the bodies hit the dance floor to this heartbreak beat
I feel like somebody's watchin' me
(Feels like everybody's watchin' me)

Seductively destructive, we are true romance
Does the man become the monster or the monster become man?

[Chorus]
I could be up all night, but I'm paralyzed
When the creature comes alive
'Cause it's fight or fright in the full moonlight
You can run, but you can't hide
I could be honest, I could be human
I could become the silver bullet in your head
But you can't break my heart like I can

[Bridge]
Can't fight these cravings in the night
A beast who's burdened by his bite
Can't fight these cravings in the night
You can't break my heart like I can
Can't fight these cravings in the night
Moonwalking, feed the appetite
Can't fight these cravings in the night
You can't break my heart like I can

[Bridge]
And in the pale moonlight, a debt to be paid
For one must suffer for all eternity
Nothing lasts forever, even guilty pleasures, ah
[Chorus]
I could be up all night, but I'm paralyzed
When the creature comes alive
Don't wanna feel
I could be honest, I could be human
I could become the silver bullet in your head, oh

[Outro]
Can't fight these cravings in the night
A beast who's burdened by his bite
Can't fight these cravings in the night
You can't break my heart like I can
Can't fight these cravings in the night
Moonwalking, feed the appetite
Can't fight these cravings in the night
