4 ContributorsLove Sick Lyrics[Intro: Shiloh Dinasty]
No, I don't want just anyone
I'm lovin' what I see in front of me
Don't give a fuck (You make me sick-sick-sick-sick-sick-sick) 'bout anyone (CYFAL, hehehe)
I know what you need (Fuck you, Shady)
Baby, listen to me speak it

[Chorus]
Lovesick, do you hear the pain in my voice?
I need you in my arms, but I know I'm just a choice (Pew)
Oh shit, tell me how you feel about me (What?)
It just hit midnight, I can't stand on my feet
What you doing? Who do you love? Is it me?
Tell me what's good, how you been lately?
Am I good enough? Can I call you later? (Haha)
I need you with me, it's my only favor

[Verse]
Baby girl, I really wanna know (Tsahaha)
We can dance all night, or we can take it slow
I just wanna hold your hand, I don't wanna let go
Said I wanna be with you, and that's the only way I know
Like, what? You don't feel the same?
Tell me, what can I do to makе that mindset change?
Is it the way that I am? Or thе way that I'll be?
You won't give me an answer, I can't stand defeat (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Like, I been on my own, stay with me (Stay with me)
I don't wanna have another girl to make me see (Real)
The real you (What?) makes me complete (What?)
Don't make me fall down in my own thoughts (Pew, pew, pew)
So, girl, I just wanna show you some'
And I know that you wanna throw some', and it's shade (Yeah)
And it's not my name (It's not?)
I'm tryna get to your love, and now, I'm running late
They said, "She wasn't yours, it was just your turn"
And I believe it now 'cause you left me hurt
Now, my heart's ripped up with a million burns
And all I ever did to you was give you no concerns, yeah
