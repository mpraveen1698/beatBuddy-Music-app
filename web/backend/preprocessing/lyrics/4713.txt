Well, I shook hands with the devil
Down on the south side
And he bought us both a drink
With a pad and a pencil, sat by his side
I said, "Tell me what you think"

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been looking for my savior
Looking for my truth
I even asked my shrink
He brought me down to his level
Said, "Son, you're not special
You won't find him where you think

[Chorus]
"You won't find him down on Sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills
When they sold you the dream, you were just sixteen
Packed a bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA"

Took a sip of his whiskey
Said, "Now that you're with me
Well, I think that you should stay
Yeah, I know you've been busy
Searching through the city
So let me share the way

[Pre-Chorus]
"I know I'm not your savior
Know I'm not your truth
But I think we could be friends"
He said, "Come down to my level
Hang out with the devil
Let me tell you, in the end...

[Chorus]
"You won't find him down on Sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills
When they sold you the dream, you were just sixteen
Packed a bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA"
[Bridge]
And that is when I knew that it was time to go home
And that is when I realized that I was alone
And all the vibrant colors from the lights fade away
And I don't care what they say

[Chorus]
You won't find him down on Sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills
When they sold you the dream, you were just sixteen
Packed a bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
I won't find him down on Sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when I'm tripping on some pills
When they sold me the dream, I was just sixteen
Packed my bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame I came all this way
'Cause I won't find Jesus in LA
And it's a crying shame I came all this way
