12 ContributorsCracking Lyrics[Verse 1]
How you keep yourself from cracking
It's not easy, need to practice
Night time, day, don't let it
Get the best of you, girl

[Verse 2]
I can remember that time that
You slipped down, you cut your
Face right on the pavement
And I'm still up here waiting for youSee Crumb LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also like1Embed Cracking Jinx Crumb garage
