10 ContributorsDorothy LyricsScarecrow, Tin-man, Dorothy, Lion is afraid of me
Lion is afraid of me, Lion is afraid of me

Escape from reality, where I go you follow me
Where I go you follow me, where I go you follow me

Tornado swallowing my house
Get higher
It looks like it's spinning around
It looks like it's spinning around

I'm lost I'm lost in a shiny new world
Follow follow follow the yellow brick road
Walking ahead in a brand new style
Flower shower, flowers raining on meYou might also like1Embed Dorothy Dorothy Polo & Pan disco
