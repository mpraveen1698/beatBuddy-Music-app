Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Verse 2]
Well, you can knock me down
Step in my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Outro]
Well it's
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes

You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes3Embed Blue Suede Shoes The Dance Album Carl Perkins rock-n-roll
