8 ContributorsSummer 91 (Looking Back) Lyrics[Intro]
When you don't realise you're in the moment until it's a memory
(Yeah)

[Verse]
How it used to be living for the ecstasy
Got this hunger to feel it again
Holding on to yesterday, but it seems so far away
Tell me, can we just go there again?

[Chorus]
I just can't stop
I just can't stop looking back, looking back, looking back
No matter what I do
I just can't stop looking back, looking back, looking back
Until it's a memory
Until it's a memory
(Ooh, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
(Yeah)
(Yeah)
I just can't stop
I just can't stop looking back, looking back, looking back
No matter what I do
I just can't stop looking back, looking back, looking back
Until it's a memory (Yeah)
Until it's a memory (Yeah)
(Yeah)
