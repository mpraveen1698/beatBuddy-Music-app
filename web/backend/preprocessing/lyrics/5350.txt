Love me two times, baby
Love me twice today
Love me two times, girl
I'm goin' away

[Chorus]
Love me two times, girl
One for tomorrow
One just for today
Love me two times
I'm goin' away

[Verse 2]
Love me one time
Could not speak
Love me one time
Yeah, my knees got weak

[Chorus]
But love me two times, girl
Last me all through the week
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
All right, yeah!
