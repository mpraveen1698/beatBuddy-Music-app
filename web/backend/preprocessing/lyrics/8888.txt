7 ContributorsPut Your Back Into the Oar Lyrics[Intro]
Row! Row! Row! Row!
Row! Row! Row! Row!
Row! Row!

[Verse 1]
The ships await us by the Birka quay
All prepared with sixty oars
They will carry us on the open sea
Heading out to glory wars
We have blothed to Aegir
To the daughters of Ran
We are willing and eager
We are leaving at dawn
Four days of good wind
Then we awoke to an ocean mirror calm
Slacking sails, we are drifting
No direction, we are drifting

[Chorus]
Glory calls from beyond the waves
A chance for fame and rich reward
Honour waits beyond the grave
So put your back into the oar

[Verse 2]
The sun is burning, now wе're lost at sea
Our rations are running low
Thirsty throats and hungry flеas
But we still got many days to go
We are crossing the ocean
Left our home in the North
The oars have set us in motion
They will carry us forth

Each man builds his own fame
Now everyone, show me what you're worth
Who recalls a coward's name?
No one remembers, who remembers

[Chorus]
Glory calls from beyond the waves
Beckons those with a heart for war
Honour waits beyond the grave
So put your back into the oar

[Bridge]
Row! Row! Row! Row!
Row! Row! Row! Row!
Row! Row! Row! Row! (The oar is your best friend)
Row! Row! Row! Row! (For a triumphant end)
Row! Row! Row! Row! (Row for victory)
Row! Row! Row! (Into history)
Grab your oars
Row to glory wars
And for victory
Into history

[Pre-Chorus]
Each man builds his own fame
Now everyone, show me what you're worth
Who recalls a coward's name?
No one remembers, who remembers
[Chorus]
Glory calls from beyond the waves
Beckons those with a heart for war
Honour waits beyond the grave
Fear not a bloody fate
Glory calls from beyond the waves
A chance for fame and rich reward
Honour waits beyond the grave
So put your back into the oarEmbed Put Your Back Into The Oar Put Your Back Into The Oar Amon Amarth death-metal
