I'm ready to self destruct
Will you hold me, please
I don't wanna do this, but
I'm taking you with me

[Verse: Roderick Porter]
You keep playing with my heart
You're tearing me apart
Saw it coming from the start, the start, the start, the start
And I, keep trying to run away
Know you need me to stay
Don't look at me, don't look at me, don't look at me that way

[Chorus: ivri]
I'm ready to self destruct
Will you hold me, please
I don't wanna do this, but
I'm taking you with me
I'm ready to self destruct
Will you hold me, please
I don't wanna do this, but
I'm taking you with me

[Verse: Roderick Porter]
You keep playing with my heart
You're tearing me apart
Saw it coming from the start, the start, the start, the start
And I, keep trying to run away
Know  you need me to stay
Don't look at me, don't look at me, don't look at me that way
