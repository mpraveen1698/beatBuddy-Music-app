34 ContributorsCola Lyrics[Verse]
Got ready for the night and
She’s heading for the lights
She sees the vision going
Hopping line after line
See how she looks for trouble
See how she dances and
She sips the Coca-Cola
She can’t tell the difference yet

[Chorus]
That's what you’re coming for, but they don’t want to let you in and
You drop your bag to the floor and you ask them what's happening
It's getting late now, hey now, enough of the arguments
She sips the Coca-Cola, she can’t tell the difference yet

[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (She can't tell the difference yet)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (She can't tell the difference yet)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (She can't tell the difference yet)
