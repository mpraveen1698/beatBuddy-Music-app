33 ContributorsMy Type Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh ooh
Take a look around the room
Love comes wearing disguises
How to go about and choose?
Break it down by shapes and sizes
I'm a man who's got very specific taste

[Chorus]
You-you-you're just my type
Oh, you got a pulse and you are breathing
You-you-you're just my type
Ooh, I think it's time that we get leaving
You-you-you're just my type

[Verse 2]
When there's loving in the air
Don't fight it, just keep breathing
I can't help myself but stare
Double check for double meanings
I'm a man who's got very specific taste

[Chorus]
You-you-you're just my type
Oh, you got a pulse and you are breathing
You-you-you're just my type
Ooh, I think it's time that we get leaving
You-you-you're just my type
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh ooh
