66 ContributorsNutshell Lyrics[Instrumental Intro 00:00-01:00]

[Verse 1]
We chase misprinted lies
We face the path of time
And yet I fight, and yet I fight
This battle all alone
No one to cry to
No place to call home

[Refrain]
Ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
My gift of self is raped
My privacy is raked
And yet I find, and yet I find
Repeating in my head
If I can't be my own
I'd feel better dead

[Refrain]
Ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh
