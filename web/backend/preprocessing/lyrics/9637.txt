Spread your love like a fever
And don't you ever come down
Spread your love like a fever
And don't you ever come down
I spread my love like a fever
I ain't ever coming down

[Verse 1]
She gave me love like a big fire
I only saw it once
She spread her love like a fever
She's bad, but not enough

[Hook]
(I'm so low)
Spread your love like a fever
(I'm so low)
And don't you ever come down
(I'm so low)
Spread your love like a fever
(I'm so low)
And don't you ever come down
I spread my love like a fever
I ain't ever coming down

She spread her love like a big fire
I only saw it once
She gave me love like a sister
She's bad, but not enough

[Hook]
(I'm so low)
Spread your love like a fever
(I'm so low)
And don't you ever come down
(I'm so low)
Spread your love like a fever
(I'm so low)
And don't you ever come down
I spread my love like a fever
I ain't ever coming down

[Outro]
Spread your love like a fever
And don't you ever come down
Spread your love like a fever
And don't you ever come down
Spread your love like a fever
Spread your love like a fever
Spread your love like a fever
Spread your love like a fever
