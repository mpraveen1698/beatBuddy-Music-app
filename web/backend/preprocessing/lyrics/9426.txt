Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt waves this strong
Just save yourself
I learn to sink or swim, but you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drownin' in your doubt
Save yourself

[Verse 1]
I'm caught up in a current, babe
Heartbreak games you won't play
It's obvious you don't need me
That's okay, drift away

[Pre-Chorus]
I will trust my fate, you live your truth
I will get over it
It's obvious you don't need me
That's okay, drift away

[Chorus]
Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt waves this strong
Just save yourself
I learn to sink or swim, but you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drownin' in your doubt
Save yourself

You're runnin' from a hurricane
I'll set fire to the rain
I wanna be your lifeline, babe
I got tired and you got brave

[Pre-Chorus]
I will trust my fate, you live your truth
I will get over it
It's obvious you don't need me, no
Can you hear me, can you hear me, can you—

[Chorus]
Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt waves this strong
Just save yourself
I learn to sink or swim, but you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drownin' in your doubt
Save yourself

[Bridge]
If you're drownin' in your doubt
Just save yourself
[Breakdown]
(If you're drownin' in your doubt)
(Save, save)

[Chorus]
Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt waves this strong
Just save yourself
I learn to sink or swim, but you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drownin' in your doubt
