Oh, I'm obsessed
With the way your head is layin' on my chest
How you love the things I hate about myself that no one knows But with you, I see hope again
Oh, I'm a mess
When I overthink the little things in my head
You seem to always help me catch my breath
But then I lose it again
When I look at you, that's the end

[Pre-Chorus]
And why do I get so nervous when I look into your eyes?
Butterflies can't stop me fallin' for you

[Chorus]
And darling, this is more than anything I felt before
You're everything that I want
But I didn't think I'd find
Someone who was worth the wait
Of all the years of my heartbreak
But I know now I found the one I love
[Verse 2]
And I love the way
You can never find the right things to say
And you can't sit still an hour in a day
I'm so in love, let's run away because us is enough
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And why do I get so nervous when I look into your eyes?
And butterflies can't stop me fallin' for you

[Chorus]
And darling, this is more than anything I felt before
You're everything that I want
But I didn't think I'd find
Someone who was worth the wait
Of all the years of my heartbreak
But I know now I found the one

[Bridge]
Come close, let me be home for anything
Good or bad, I know it's worth it, woah, ooh-woah

[Chorus]
And darling, this is more than anything I felt before
You're everything that I want
But I didn't think I'd find
Someone who was worth the wait
Of all the years of my heartbreak
But I know now I found the one I love14Embed I GUESS I'M IN LOVE I GUESS I'M IN LOVE Clinton Kane singer-songwriter
