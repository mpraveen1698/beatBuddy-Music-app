One, two

[Verse 1]
All that I want
Is to wake up fine
Tell me that I'm alright
That I ain't gonna die
All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it's alright
For me to come out

[Chorus]
Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times, hard times
And I gotta get to rock bottom (Uh)

[Verse 2]
Walking around
With my little rain cloud
Hangin' over my head
And it ain't coming down
Where do I go?
Give me some sort of sign
You hit me with lightning
Maybe I'll come alive
You might also like[Chorus]
Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times, hard times
And I gotta hit rock bottom (Uh)

[Bridge]
Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground

[Chorus]
Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times (Hard times), hard times (Hard times)
Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times (Hard times), hard times
[Outro]
Hard times
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder
Hard times
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I survive
And I gotta get to rock bottom (Uh)83Embed Hard Times After Laughter Paramore punk
