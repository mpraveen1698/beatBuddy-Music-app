24 ContributorsStormtroopers Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now there's a standstill in the war
Repeating what's been done before
It must come to an end
A few will transcend

They were under twenty five
And under fire they would thrive
The Sturmmann is born
Their enemies scorn

[Pre-Chorus]
A glimpse of the future, new tactics in war
New doctrine in combat explored
As fast as lightning, there's no time to mourn
A glimpse of the future and Blitzkrieg is born

[Chorus]
Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches, the Stormtroopers rise

[Verse 2]
JÃ¤gers led the way
The pioneers would join the fray
Initiative gained
Advancement sustained

As they're advancing through the land
Encircling their flanks
And ravage their ranks

[Pre-Chorus]
Expose their reinforcements, destroying their lines
New doctrine in combat aligns
Infantry attacks, exposing the cracks
New combat ideals, on the Kaiserschlacht's fields

[Chorus]
Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches, the Stormtroopers rise

[Pre-Chorus]
A glimpse of the future, new tactics in war
New doctrine in combat explored
As fast as lightning, there's no time to mourn
A glimpse of the future and Blitzkrieg is born

[Chorus]
Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches, the Stormtroopers rise
[Chorus]
Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches, the Stormtroopers riseEmbed Stormtroopers The War to End All Wars Sabaton swedish
