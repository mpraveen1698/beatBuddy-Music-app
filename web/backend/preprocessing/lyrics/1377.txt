Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie

[Verse 1]
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Tell your mom, girl, and I won't stop it until you're mine, girl
And you can't stop that until your mine, girl
And I can't find out what you want, what you got
I got that honey-pie, come bite it
Bring your own fork, girl, you know I don't provide it

[Chorus]
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie

Tell your mom, girl, and I won't stop it until you're mine, girl
And you can't stop that until your mine, girl (Ha!)

[Chorus]
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie

[Outro]
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie
(Tell your mom, girl, and I won't stop it until you're mine, girl
And you can't stop that until your mine, girl)
Ooh, girl, don't you stop
Don't you stop 'til you get enough, honey
Oh, honey, honey-pie, honey, honey, honey-pie
(And I can't find out what you want, what you got
I got that honey-pie, come bite it)15Embed Honeypie For Abby JAWNY indie-pop
