2 ContributorsChances (English Translation) Lyrics[Intro: AP Dhillon]
Tell me, should I love you or not?
Then I can explain it to my heart
Do you accept the plant of my heart or not?
Or should I plant it in someone else's garden?

[Verse 1: AP Dhillon]
It's difficult to accept this
I just wanted to talk to you
I would've taken care of everything
All you had to do was say yes
All my dreams are broken
You broke my heart

[Chorus: AP Dhillon]
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you

[Verse 2: Gurinder Gill]
I could see your city from the mountains
It was a lovely afternoon
The sun was bright orange
But your colours were causing chaos
If I could hold your hand
I would feel overjoyed
You might also like[Chorus: Gurinder Gill]
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you

[Verse 3: AP Dhillon]
I would've drawn you in the sand
And counted the waves with you
Under a roof of stars
We could've had a deep conversation
I bought some expensive wine
We could've filled up our cups

[Chorus: AP Dhillon]
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you

[Verse 4: Gurinder Gill]
I opened up my heart to you
I only ever told you the truth
I've never seen a girl as beautiful as you
Now where do I go from here?
Be careful, please don't fill my eyes
With tears yet again
[Chorus: Gurinder Gill]
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see youEmbed Chances Not by Chance AP Dhillon;Gurinder Gill;Money Musik hip-hop
