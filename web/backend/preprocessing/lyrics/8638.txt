6 ContributorsNot Like I’m In Love With You Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're just friends right?
Like we've been right?
So you can tell me 'bout the girl that you kissed last night
Keep going on about staying at her house
It's not like I feel like I could throw up right now
You're my ride or die
So I'm not jealous right?
'Cause the way I feel about you is just black and white
And I ain't been staying up
Overthinking us
Tripping all over these feelings, nah that'd be dumb

[Pre-Chorus]
It's fine, yeah it's cool
Not like I wanna make a move
It's fine, yeah it's cool
It's not like I'm in love with you
Shit

[Chorus]
No I'm not feeling unwell
No it's not scary as hell that I
Want you more than anyone else
Want your body all to myself
It's not likе I'm losing my head
Thinking 'bout you in my bed
Keep doing that thing you do
It's not like I'm in lovе with you

It started slow but then like dominoes
I started free falling for you, no control
Couldn't hide the truth from my friends too
It's not like everybody knows but you

[Pre-Chorus]
It's fine, yeah it's cool
I totally know what to do
It's fine, yeah it's cool
It's not like I'm in love with you

[Chorus]
No I'm not feeling unwell
No it's not scary as hell that I
Want you more than anyone else
Want your body all to myself
It's not like I'm losing my head
Thinking 'bout you in my bed
Keep doing that thing you do
It's not like I'm in love with you

[Bridge]
It's not like
It's not like I'm in love with you
It's not like
It's not like I'm in love with you
[Chorus]
No I'm not feeling unwell
No it's not scary as hell that I
Want you more than anyone else
Want your body all to myself
It's not like I'm losing my head
Thinking 'bout you in my bed
Keep doing that thing you do
It's not like I'm in love with you

[Outro]
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with you
But it's not like I'm in love with you
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with you
But it's not like I'm in love with you
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with you
But it's not like I'm in love with you
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with you
But it's not like I'm in love with youEmbed Not Like I’m In Love With You Not Like I’m In Love With You Lauren Weintraub songwriter
