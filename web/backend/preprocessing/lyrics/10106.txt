Matafaka, matafaka

[Instrumental Drop]

[Verse: Marvin Divine]
Uh, thank god that the brother's on the rise now
Endless celebrations all at my house
Levitatin' now I'm super duper fly now
Lemon boy but they see why I reside now
Put the time in while you always yellin' time out
F a critic cause I know I'm comin' wit it
You were sittin' you were wishin', I was handlin' my business
Now I got the ball like Harry Potter playin' Quidditch
And my nuts are so humoungous you would think that Hagrid's in it
Ah man, I'm all bad, yeah I'm all bad
Workin' for that whip, yeah that what you call that
I'ma blow up in the summer have em yellin' "fall back"
And I've always been ahead like an effin ball cap
Man I came in the game like "woah"
Gotta couple chains on me cause I like gold
They told me im the best, and I told them "I know"
Cause when I'm in your town every ticket I sold

[Pre-Chorus: Marvin Divine]
Yeah, they sayin' I'm the man, facts bro
A lot of haters, tell me where they at tho
I'm the new pop all I do is rap doh
"Want me on your song?" Throw a couple stacks yo
Everybody wanna do the same thing
That's we ain't on the same page
Do my own thing, and I maintain
Flow like water so I'm goin' mainstream
