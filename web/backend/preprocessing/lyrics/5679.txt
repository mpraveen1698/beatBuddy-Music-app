67 ContributorsReal Life Lyrics[Intro: Diddy]
It ain't like you hearing it and it's like moving you
You know music is, and the music you making is life
And it's like new life
It's important to me to understand the state of mind
And the life you live
And where you're, you know, where you're at right now

[Verse 1: Burna Boy]
Pull up like "Surprise, surprise it's the President"
Can't you see that I'm in my element?
I might just decide to slide on my enemies
I go along on a glide for the hell of it
I bring a different vibe when I'm steppin' in
If a nigga ain't right, I'm correcting him
Everybody know for sure, I'ma take it there
So cross your T's and dot your I's when you're messaging
I never subscribe to guys on the internet
Living for the clout, telling lies to the press again
Better don't take me for the fool, I ain't never been
Don't bother with lies, I'm wise when I'm checkin' in
I'm redirecting dem back to the sender men
Then you go see reality, go start arresting dem
Be like say dem no hear when I was telling dem
Life real, I ain't never like the rest of them

Yes, we are blessed, but it's harder to see sometimes
Tryna find my peace of mind, you said, "How could we be so blind, babe?"
You just follow your dreams and go live your life
I'll give you something to believe in, I'ma be the reason

[Chorus: Stormzy]
So please (So please), please stay (Please stay)
Say you won't leave (Say you won't leave)
Real life is for living but the price you've been giving's not cheap
So please stay
We'll share the whole fee, yeah
Real life is for living, use this life that you're living, be free

[Verse 2: Burna Boy]
I wonder which style dem guys dem go try now
If una never hear my story mek you find out
I know say nobody is an island
But if dem wan fuck you for nyash, mek you no lie down
And I know you fit later realize am
But the way you don dey move I no dey like am
Somebody want to wear the shoe wey no size am
Me, I be Destiny's Child, a survivor
Real, no be China
Come here, I've been the guy
And nothing I ever said ever been a lie
Anytime you see me, look up in the sky
I can see the daylight in the night
When you see a soldier smile, it's a good sign
That's the way it is on the south side
I no go let you slide, no, not this time
But now I'm tryna ride, fuck a good time
Goodbye
[Pre-Chorus: Stormzy]
Yes, we are blessed, but it's harder to see sometimes
Tryna find my peace of mind, you said, "How could we be so blind, babe?"
You just follow your dreams and go live your life
I'll give you something to believe in, I'ma be the reason

[Chorus: Stormzy]
So please (So please), please stay (Please stay)
Say you won't leave (Say you won't leave)
Real life is for living but the price you've been giving's not cheap
So please stay
We'll share the whole fee, yeah
Real life is for living, use this life that you're living, be free

[Outro: Burna Boy]
Real life, uh-huh
This life, this life
Give you real life, uh-huh (Real life is for living)
And I know why, uh-huh
This life, this life
This life, uh-huh
Real life, uh-huh (Real life is for living, use this life that you're living, be free)2Embed Real Life (feat. Stormzy) Twice As Tall Burna Boy;Stormzy dancehall
