4 ContributorsJust to break my heart Lyrics[Intro]
Did you leave me here just to break my heart?
And did you fear our love, was it all just talk

[Verse]
It floated away, without a goodbye
I think our hope went out this time
Relying on dreams to show me your face

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll say
Come back, come back, come back someday

[Chorus]
Did you leave me here just to break my heart?
And did you fear our love would just fall apart?
Oh... no...
I thought you’d stay to save me
And did you leave me here just to break my heart?

[Bidge]
I thought you'd stay
I thought you'd stay around (For me)
I thought you’d stay
I thought you'd stay around (For me)
(For mе)
