5 ContributorsCall Me Lyrics[Verse 1: keshi]
I wanna see her again
Maybe I'll just be a friend
Or a lover to lean on
I'm
Catchin' the pieces again
Of a heart that would like to pretend
That it isn't bleedin'

[Chorus: keshi]
Say you'll call me, baby
Tell me you'll be okay
If I leave you alone today

[Verse 2: keshi]
You
Blinded with tears and confused
When beauty is all that will do
You'll break into pieces

[Chorus: keshi]
Say you'll call me, baby
Tell me you'll be okay
If I leave you alone today

[Outro: keshi]
I'm better than this
You're better than this
We're better than this
Oh God, we're better than this
Why do it like this?
Why do we do it like this?You might also like3Embed Call Me Call Me Rainlord.;keshi chill
