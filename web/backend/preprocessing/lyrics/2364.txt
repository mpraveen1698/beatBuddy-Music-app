30 ContributorsSanta Monica Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am still living with your ghost
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast
I don't want to be your downtime
I don't want to be your stupid game

[Verse 2]
With my big black boots and an old suitcase
I do believe I'll find myself a new place
I don't want to be the bad guy
I don't want do your sleepwalk dance anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to see some palm trees
I will try and shake away this disease

[Chorus]
We could live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
We could live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die

I am still dreaming of your face
Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away
I don't want to be your good time
I don't want to be your fall-back crutch anymore

[Verse 4]
I'll walk right out into a brand new day
Insane and rising in my own weird way
I don't want to be the bad guy
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to feel some sunshine
I just want to find some place to be alone

[Chorus]
We could live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
We could live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
We could live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
We could live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
[Outro]
Yeah! Yeah! Watch the world die
Yeah! Yeah! Watch the world die
Whoa! Yeah! Watch the world die
Yeah! Watch the world die15Embed Santa Monica Sparkle And Fade Everclear grunge
