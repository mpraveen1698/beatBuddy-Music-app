13 ContributorsForever and Ever, Amen Lyrics[Verse 1]
You may think that I'm talking foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you, always will be
But you're not just time that I'm killing
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live, this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die, oh, baby

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, Amenâ€‹
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, Amen

[Verse 2]
They say that time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey
But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway
They say that time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you, oh, darling

I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, Amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
Well, just listen to how this song ends
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, Amen

[Outro]
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, forever and ever
