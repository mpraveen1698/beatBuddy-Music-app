Can't you look at me?
Am I that hideous to you?
Can’t you talk to me?
Do I really mean nothing to you?

[Post-Chorus]
Turn away
Forget everything
Turn away
Forget everything

[Verse 1]
Does it seem too hard?
Does it seem unright to keep in touch?
When was the last time?
We spoke at all, now tell me, baby

[Verse 2]
Wasn't that long ago
When I had you in my hands
Wasn't that long ago
I could see by your eyes, you cared
So I thought
So I thought
You might also like[Chorus]
Can’t you look at me, or
Am I that hideous to you?
Can't you talk to me, or
Do I really mean nothing to you?

[Verse 3]
Was it all a lie?
Those feelings you said you had for me
Was it all a lie?
Or do you have no feelings really?

[Chorus]
Can't you look at me, or
Am I that hideous to you?
Can't you talk to me, or
Do I really mean nothing to you?

[Outro]
Turn away
Forget everything
That's okay
I regret nothing, nothing3Embed hideous SKY ON FIRE mehro songwriter
