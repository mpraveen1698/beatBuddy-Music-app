All I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It’s hard to forget when you messed up my head 'cause I let you get too close, yeah

[Verse 1]
I should of never, of never, of never opened my heart again, wasn’t worth it (Wasn't worth it)
Why did I let you, I let you, I let you get all under my skin, wasn’t worth it (Wasn't worth it)

[Pre-Chorus]
On the surface
You were perfect
But you didn’t really come to stay
Now, when I look
In the mirror
I slowly watch you fade away

[Chorus]
'Cause all I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It’s hard to forget when you messed up my head ‘cause I let you get too close
Now, all I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It’s hard to forget when you messed up my head ‘cause I let you get too close, yeah

[Verse 2]
I tried to cover it, cover it, cover it with foundation
Didn’t help it (Help it)
Try to get over you, over you, over you, but you dug in, and I felt it (Felt it)

On the surface (On the surface)
You were perfect (You were perfect)
But you didn’t really come to stay (Didn't really come to stay)
Now, when I look (Now when I look)
In the mirror (In the mirror)
I slowly watch you fade away

[Chorus]
'Cause all I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It’s hard to forget when you messed up my head ‘cause I let you get too close (Oh, no)
Now, all I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go (Let me go, oh)
It’s hard to forget when you messed up my head ‘cause I let you get too close, yeah

[Outro]
It’s hard to forget when you messed up my head ‘cause I let you get too close19Embed Marks On My Neck CHARLIE Charlie Puth dance
