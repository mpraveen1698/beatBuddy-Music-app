5 ContributorsThis Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've climbed a thousand mountains
I've walked a thousand miles
Thrown pennies into fountains
I've hidden hurt with smiles
I don't fall in love
Love falls into me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
But deep down I just know that I belong here

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted is this
To take a shot and know I won't miss
To hear those words come from your lips
Whatever it is, I'll take the risk
'Cause all I've ever wanted is this

[Verse 2]
I've made some mistakes
I've been through bad patches
I've done what it takes
To come back from the ashes
I don't fall in love
Love falls into me

And I know what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
But deep down I just know that I belong here

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted is this
To take a shot and know I won't miss
To hear those words come from your lips
Whatever it is, I'll take the risk
'Cause all I ever wanted is this

[Bridge]
Out of a hundred no's
You only need one yes
There's no easy road
To take me where I need to get
I've been knocked down low
They haven't beat me yet
Got everything I need
Right in front of me

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted is this, oh (To take a shot and know I won't miss)
(To close my eyes) And not need to wish
Whatever it is, I'll take the risk
'Cause all I've ever wanted is this
To find something I don't have to fix
To hear those words come from your lips
Whatever it is, I'll take the risk
'Cause all I've ever wanted is thisEmbed This This Megan McKenna british
