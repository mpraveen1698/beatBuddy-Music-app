Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk no more

[Chorus]
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had

[Verse 1]
We kissed in the morning on a summer day
You taste like cigarettes and hurricanes
There's a warning written in the corners of your face
Whiplash and you left me in a vapour trail
Now I know it's safe to say
Nothing's perfect anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
(You said) You fell in love, but you don't know how
We were good once, but I'm fucked up now
(You said) I was dumb, trying to work things out
I built a house and you burned it down

[Chorus]
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what wе had

Just a minute now, there's somеthing different now
All your morning sounds, how's it all so loud?
Put the flowers down 'cause they look like clouds
Leave me to it then and let your hair grow out
Now I know it's safe to say
Nothing's perfect anyway

[Chorus]
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had

[Pre-Chorus]
(You said) You fell in love, but you don't know how
We were good once, but I'm fucked up now
(You said) I was dumb, trying to work things out
I built a house and you burned it down

[Chorus]
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had
[Outro]
We fell in love, but you don't know how
We were good once, but I'm fucked up now6Embed I Don't Wanna Talk (I Just Wanna Dance) Dreamland (+ Bonus Levels) Glass Animals indie-pop
