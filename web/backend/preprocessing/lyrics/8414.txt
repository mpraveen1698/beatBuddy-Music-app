3 ContributorsMore and More (single version) Lyrics[Chorus: Nina]
More and more and more
I don't know where we're going to
More and more and more
There's so much we don't wanna do
'Cause we lie, we cheat
And we run from each and every heart affair
Yes, we lie, we cheat
And we hurt 'til somebody is in despair

[Verse 1: Captain Hollywood]
Boom, keep in tune
Hollywood will zoom
Left to the point, right to the point
Smoke it, like it's a joint
Makin'
Ain't got time to be fakin'
It's my turn and I'm takin'
Everything without shakin'
Yo, here with the bacon
Happy is how we should be
Realise that we are wealthy
Livin' here on this Earth
Enjoy what it's worth
Anger left behind you
Just don't let it find you
Love will not remain
As long as you complain
You might also like[Chorus: Nina]
More and more and more
I don't know where we're going to
More and more and more
There's so much we don't wanna do
'Cause we lie, we cheat
And we run from each and every heart affair
Yes, we lie, we cheat
And we hurt 'til somebody is in despair

[Post-Chorus: Nina]
More and more and more
More and more and more

[Verse 2: Captain Hollywood]
More and more, bam, don't give a damn
Pump the music and jam
There's no time for the problem
Not a thought to solve 'em
But just make sure you get it
Show the fella's you with it
Being proud you did it
Never will you forget it
There's a way to stop this
Listen to the prophets
Everything they said
Yo, it should be read
Paul, he had to tell
Things that made him well
L.I.G.H.T. shinin'
And my brother's heart cryin'
[Chorus: Nina]
More and more and more
I don't know where we're going to
More and more and more
There's so much we don't wanna do
'Cause we lie, we cheat
And we run from each and every heart affair
Yes, we lie, we cheat
And we hurt 'til somebody is in despair

More and more and more
I don't know where we're going to
More and more and more
There's so much we don't wanna do
'Cause we lie, we cheat
And we run from each and every heart affair
Yes, we lie, we cheat
And we hurt 'til somebody is in despair
