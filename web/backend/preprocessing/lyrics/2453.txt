18 ContributorsThe Drum Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ooh, I can't pretend
Like you didn't bring my tempo up again (Tempo up again)
My head's in a spin
You send my body to a place it's never been

[Chorus]
Baby, won't you let me
Keep you up all night, let the morning come closer
You send me so high now, the ceiling can't hold us
Listen to my heart, let the rhythm control ya
I'll be there when you need my love
Just follow the beat of my drum (Drum, drum, drum, drum, drum)

[Drop]
It goes um-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Um-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Um-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Um-pa-pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum, pum-pa-pum-pum
Just follow the beat of my drum

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I can't pretend
Like I didn't let your love go to my head, ah-ah, mm-mm
Ooh, I'm in a spin
You send my body to a place it's nеver been, ah-ah
