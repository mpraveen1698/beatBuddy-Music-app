Toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick
I thought maybe we would kiss tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, will you kiss me already?
And toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Baby, though I've closed my eyes
I know who you pretend I am
I know who you pretend I am

[Bridge]
But, do-mi-ti
Why not me? Why not me?
Do-mi-ti
Why not me? Why not me?

[Chorus]
Do-mi-ti
Why not me? Why not me?See Mitski LiveGet tickets as low as $8You might also like68Embed Washing Machine Heart Be the Cowboy Mitski indie
