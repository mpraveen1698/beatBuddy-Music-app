2 ContributorsCome With Me Lyrics[Verse]
At the end of every week each one of us becomes a freak
Tonight the DJ makes us move and then the sweat drops from the roof
Each time you let the bass beat hard to know we all spend now apart
Just activate your energy lets sing the song and come with me

[Pre-Drop 1]
The speaker system brings the sound
And a lot of heads starts spinnin' round
All the people on the floor they shake their bodiеs cry for more
Never lеt this feeling go and let the music take control
Forget your problems and be free
Enjoy this moment, come with me

[Pre-Drop 2]
At the end of every week each one of us becomes a freak
Tonight the DJ makes us move and then the sweat drops from the roof
Each time you let the bass beat hard to know we all spend now apart
Just activate your energy lets sing the song and come with me

Lets sing the song and come with me
Just activate your energy lets sing the song and come with me

At the end of every week each one of us becomes a freak
Tonight the dj makes us move and then the sweat drops from the roof
Each time you let the bass beat hard to know we all spend now apart
