13 ContributorsThe Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
You don't need to call me now you're gone
That's not how it works when you get lonely
Don't tell me you love me when you don't
Selling out your sorrys
Now you don't have to worry cause

[Pre-Chorus]
You said youâ€™d change
But, you stayed the same
You didn't mean it
But I believed it
And now I stuck around though
You let me down
Just like you said you'd never do

[Chorus]
There goes the years I spent my time on you
There's goes the months of powering through
There goes another week of feeling blue
There goes the days of missing you
There goes the days, the days, the days, the days
There goes the days of missing you
There goes the days, the days, the days, the days
There goes the days of missing you

Didn't get to tell you how I felt
You threw it all away
And then you put my heart through hell
All those nights I opened up you couldn't tell
That I was being honest
And did you get just what you wanted?
'Cause, you said you'd changed
But, you stayed the same
You didn't mean it
But I believed it
And now I stuck around though
You let me down
Just like you said you'd never do

[Chorus]
There goes the years I spent my time on you
There's goes the months of powering through
There goes another week of feeling blue
There goes the days of missing you
There goes the days, the days, the days, the days
There goes the days of missing you
There goes the days, the days, the days, the days
There goes the days of missing you
There goes the days I missing you
All of the days of missing you
There goes the years I spent my time on you
There's goes the months of powering through
There goes another week of feeling blue
There goes the days of missing you3Embed The Days The Days Sandro Cavazza swedish
