Every time my hand reaches for yours
I feel the hesitation, I'm sure that you're not sure
Every time your lips are kissing mine
I taste the indecision, it's messing with my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I know there's a part of you that's terrified to love again
But I promise 'til the end

[Chorus]
I'll never run, leave you behind
I'II never hurt you like he hurt you
I'll never make you cry
I'll treat you right, I'll stand by you
And no matter whatever happens
I'II never not love you

[Verse 2]
All of me is diving in the deep
While you're standing at the shoreline, the waves are at your feet
Trust will never happen overnight
But if you give me more time, I swear you'll see the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I know there's a part of you that's terrified to love again
But I promise 'til the end
You might also like[Chorus]
I'll never run, leave you behind
I'll never hurt you like he hurt you
I'Il never make you cry
I'll treat you right, I'll stand by you
And no matter whatever happens
I'll never not love you

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'll never not, I'll never not

[Bridge]
I know there's a part of you that is terrified to love again
But I promise till the end
Yeah, I promise till the end

[Chorus]
I'll never run, leave you behind
I'II never hurt you like he hurt you
I'll never say goodbye
I'll treat you right, I'll stand by you
And no matter whatever happens
I'lI never not love you

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'll never not, I'll never not love youEmbed I'll Never Not Love You I'll Never Not Love You Michael Bublé j-pop
