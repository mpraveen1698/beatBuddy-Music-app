8 Contributors​mr. sunshine Lyrics[Intro]
I'm sorry I'm not Mr. Sunshine
All jokes, 'til I start feeling like the punchline
I know that you want Mr. Optimistic, that ain't realistic
I ain't Mr. Sunshine
(Na-na-na-na)

[Verse 1]
Do my smile keep you around?
How about when it's upside down?
How about when I'm in bed four or five days
Will you love me now?
I bet money you’d smell cyanide in my honey
Watch me cry at night and then roll your eyes
'Til you decide to start runnin’
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be ready when you let me
Don't forget me
Maybe I ain't what I was then

[Chorus]
I'm sorry I'm not Mr. Sunshine
All jokes, 'til I start feeling like the punchline
I know that you want Mr. Optimistic, that ain't realistic
I ain't Mr. Sunshine
(Na-na-na-na)
I'm sorry I'm not Mr. Sunshine, so low
And I might be here for a long time
I know that you want Mr. Optimistic, that ain't realistic
I ain't Mr. Sunshine
(Na-na-na-na)

Remember the time that I told you your troubles are mine
And I'd hold you down, stick around
Now you know where to be found
Now you want rainbows
I'm a hurricane, a tornado
Full of hurt and pain, and we don't hurt the same
But I still care if you're okay though
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be ready when you let me
Don't forget me
Maybe I ain't what I was then

[Chorus]
I'm sorry I'm not Mr. Sunshine
All jokes, 'til I start feeling like the punchline
I know that you want Mr. Optimistic, that ain't realistic
I ain't Mr. Sunshine
(Na-na-na-na)
I'm sorry I'm not Mr. Sunshine, so low
And I might be here for a long time
I know that you want Mr. Optimistic, that ain't realistic
I ain't Mr. Sunshine
(Na-na-na-na)
[Outro]
I ain't Mr. Sunshine
(Na-na-na-na)
I ain't Mr. Sunshine
