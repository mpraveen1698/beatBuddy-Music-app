18 ContributorsParadise Lyrics[Verse 1]
Said you would rather die young
Live for the moment, forget tomorrow
Guess that you got it all wrong
Still tryna find out which road to follow

[Pre-Chorus]
Always tried to ride those paper planes
Said that you were fine with my mistakes
Now we're tryna call on yesterday to go back

[Chorus]
We don't always get it right
The lights go out, the music dies, no goodbye
Now you're gone, I realize
I cast us out of paradise
Even if it all went down in flames
We can live to fight another day
Let go and close your eyes
And just remеmber paradise

It doеsn't matter tonight
There's a tomorrow for you to treasure
No sense in losing our minds
To keep the pieces of us together

[Pre-Chorus]
Thought about it for a while now
Questioned everything up in your life now
Maybe you should let it ride out
And everything will come around, yeah

[Chorus]
We don't always get it right
The lights go out, the music dies, no goodbye
Now you're gone, I realize
I cast us out of paradise
Even if it all went down in flames
We can live to fight another day
Let go and close your eyes
And just remember paradise

[Chorus]
We don't always get it right
The lights go out, the music dies, no goodbye
Now you're gone, I realize
I cast us out of paradise (Cast us out of paradise)

[Drop]
Para–
Paradise
Oh, woah, I realize (Para–)
Cast us out of paradise

We don't always get it right
The lights go out, the music dies, no goodbye (The music dies)
Now you're gone, I realize
I cast us out of paradise2Embed Paradise World Of Walker Alan Walker;K-391;Boy In Space house
