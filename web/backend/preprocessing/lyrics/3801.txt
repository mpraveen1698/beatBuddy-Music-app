It's hard for girls like us
We don't know who we trust
Not even the ones we love
'Cause they don't know

[Verse 1]
Stuck here
Stuck here in these waters
So sick to my stomach
Is anybody there?
Red lights
Red lights in the darkness
Everyone's so heartless
Does anybody care?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so hard to explain
With your heart in a cage
Only whisper, but you wanna shout
'Cause the second you wake
Too much pressure to take
Every part of you wants to cry out

[Chorus]
It's hard for girls likе us
We don't know who we trust
Not evеn the ones we love
'Cause they don't know
Try to numb this pain
'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again
Left alone out in the rain
They don't know

Mirror
Mirror on the wall
I don't see beautiful
Staring back at me
Watching
Watching my heart bleed out
Trying not to freak out

[Chorus]
It's hard for girls like us
We don't know who we trust
Not even the ones we love
'Cause they don't know
Try to numb this pain
'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again
Left alone out in the rain
They don't know

[Post-Chorus]
It's hard for us, for girls like us
Girls like us, they don't know
It's hard for us, for girls like us
Girls like us, they don't know

[Bridge]
So, oh
And the worst part is when they smile like this
And it hits me hard, hits me hard
Tryin' to play it cool, but inside I'm bruised
And it breaks my heart, breaks my heart
[Chorus]
It's hard for all of us
We don't know who we trust
Not even the ones we love
They don't know
Try to numb this pain
'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again
Left alone out in the rain
They don't know

[Post-Chorus]
It's hard for us, for girls like us (Girls like us)
Girls like us, they don't know
It's hard for us (Oh no), for girls like us (Girls like us)
Girls like us, they don't know8Embed Girls Like Us Girls Like Us Zoe Wees german
