Ooh, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la

[Verse 1]
You deserve more than a cameo
How are you not in my video?
Lets take it back to my studio
And we can let it roll tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, come with me now, your scene's 'bout to start
I do believe I can see you're a star
Don't know your name, but you're made for the part
'Cause you're perfect, babe
Time to work it, babe

[Chorus]
It's your undress rehearsal
So take your clothes off
Show me how you show off
It's your undress rehearsal
You the main attraction
Lights, camera, action

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la (Yeah, say ooh)
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la

So we should let it roll tonight

[Verse 3]
Stop, let the credits roll
On star status, need a telescope
Magazines, that centerfold
All the dudes like, "She could get it though"
She could get it though? (She could get it though)
From the top down, like it sexual
See that wardrobe at awards show
Now it's your name in a envelope like

It's your undress rehearsal
So take your clothes off
Show me how you show off (Say yeah)
It's your undress rehearsal (Ooh)

Ooh, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la (Come on, yeah, listen, ha, everybody say)
Ooh, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la (What? everybody say)
Ooh, la-la-la (Uh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, let's go)
