What's your name? Nice to meet you
Por favor, señorita
You're the rarest of creatures
Like the rain in Ibiza
What's your name? Nice to meet you
Por favor, señorita
You're the rarest of creatures
Like the rain in Ibiza (In Ibiza)

[Post-Chorus]
In Ibiza
Like the rain in Ibiza (In Ibiza)
What's your name? Nice to meet you
Por favor, señorita
You're the rarest of creatures
Like the rain in Ibiza

[Verse]
Let's go to a place, go anywhere, don't wanna stay
I wanna get to know you, wanna feel you
Never felt so close, but at the same time, far away
We're so different and yet so familiar

[Chorus]
So what's your name? Nice to meet you
Por favor, señorita
You're the rarest of creatures
Like the rain in Ibiza (In Ibiza)

You're the rarest of creatures
