(I am The Lord)

Blasting JACKBOYS "GATTI"
Yo, I’m sick like Omnicroni
I just folded up
Like yogis doing origami

I roll around wit #Comrades
They stand by me like the Army
I hit the hex
I’m Intuit’
Don’t tempt me, bitch:
QuickBooks

I know I confuse them
Niggas cannot read my mind…

I’m the same ass nigga who was down in Miami
Lost on Ocean Time

I rock Gucci, Louis, Prada
All my broz
They shop at Saks

Bagged the bitch
Hopped in the Subie
Left Ocean Grove
Cruise past Fifth Ave
(Fiff Ave)

“My dick so good
Should make him pay me…”

“I missed a bar
I guess I’m lazy…”

[Yo Gotti - Verse 7]:

I’m knockin all my opps out the field
Young nigga sick
Young nigga ill

All uh my niggas, you named it
Just ballin’ to D.C., you named it
I gave em the pack and he tanked it
25 paints and he dranked it
Just showed her my account and she fainted
Showed him the plug and thanked me

"Hey Gotti, you low, you janked me"
Lil bitch just post me: brainless

Rolls Royce: stainless
Made my neighborhood famous
Ridgecrest for tourists
Aye, why yo jewelry blurry?
All my jewelry flawless
All my niggas thoughtless
None uh my niggas sanctified
But they be throwin crosses

All my [?] all set
All my diamonds factory set
Damn, my lil series
I stamp that
My bitch like the same sex, yeah

I see the same niggas doin the same shit erryday
Different nigga, yeah, I had to go and make a way
Any day, it’s another million dolla play
It’s like 70 mill, now anotha hunnid on de wayEmbed I Got Summer On My Mind I Got Summer On My Mind Jay Dunham club
