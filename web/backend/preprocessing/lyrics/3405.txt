Let's light it up, let's light it up until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light that never shined so bright
We'll find a way, we'll find a way to keep the cold night
From breaking in over the walls into the wild side
The hunger satisfied

[Chorus]
We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun, woah-oh
We might as well be lovers on the sun, woah-oh
We might as well be lovers on the sun

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
We'll never know, we'll never know what stands behind the door
But I got a feeling it's a feeling that's worth dying for
Just close your eyes and hold your breath because it feels right
We'll keep it moving till we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride

[Chorus]
We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun, woah-oh
We might as well be lovers on the sun, woah-oh
We might as well be lovers on the sun
