25 ContributorsMeltdown Lyrics[Intro]
Go!

[Verse 1]
It feels so frantic, automatic, a collapsing paradigm
E-E-E-E-Everybody's dancing on the ashes, all hail the end of time
We're wrapped in chain reactions
From words of mass distraction
So we explode in the snow globe while the cure is classified

[Pre-Chorus]
Ignoring the warming and now we're globally mourning
And it's too late for a warning, it's too late

[Chorus]
Run away, run away
Man-infested destiny
No escape, no escape
Headfirst into the outbreak
This is our apocalypse
Doomsday at our fingertips
3, Trigger the countdown
2, Run up the head count
1, We're all invitеd, invited to the meltdown

[Verse 2]
Spiral to еxtinction, and we know we're fucked
'Cause you can't spell out "virus" without "us"
Contagion, we're cutting our throats with our own knives
The end of mankind will be televised
(On tonight's series finale, we're all gonna fuckin' die)

Run away, run away
Man-infested destiny
No escape, no escape
Headfirst into the outbreak
This is our apocalypse
Doomsday at our fingertips
3, Trigger the countdown
2, Run up the head count
1, We're all invited, invited to the meltdown
Oh

[Spoken Post-Chorus]
Warning: Please remain calm and evacuate immediately
Humanity has begun self destruction

[Breakdown]
Bottom line feeder, parasite preacher
Writing off lives, you're in bed with the reaper
Sealed with a kiss, decease to exist
Havoc is automatic
Surrender to the static
We love it cinematic
Oh my god, don't panic
Shock the system
Let the axe fall to your knees
Land of disease
Kill or be killed, the American scream
Bottom line feeder, parasite preacher
Now your judgement day is here
[Chorus]
Run away, run away
Man-infested destiny
No escape, no escape
Headfirst into the outbreak
This is our apocalypse
Doomsday at our fingertips
3, Side effects
2, Are not allowed
1, But may include a meltdown
3, Celebrate
2, The fallout
1, I'm warming up, up, up, to a meltdown

[Outro]
Collapsing in static
