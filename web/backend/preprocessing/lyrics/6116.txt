I should have seen it coming when roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
Baby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are "know-it-alls" and I played that fool for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

[Chorus]
If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

[Verse 2]
Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving
You might also like[Chorus]
If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

[Pre-Chorus]
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

[Chorus]
If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

[Outro]
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
Then, I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song1Embed This Ain't A Love Song These Days Bon Jovi metal
