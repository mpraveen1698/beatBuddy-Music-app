Come on in, the weather's dreadful
We always have a room to spare
Don't mind mother, she is not well
The doctors say she's not all there

[Pre-Chorus: Spencer Charnas]
She's crazy, I must confess
I'm so sick of cleaning up her mess

[Chorus: Spencer Charnas, Ricky Armellino]
I hope saying goodnight
Doesn't mean saying goodbye!
Now under the pressure, we're drowning together
Going down the drain tonight
(The drain tonight!)

[Verse 2: Spencer Charnas, Spoken Word]
Come on back, I'll fix you something
Be careful not to cross the line
Cause she and I are sure of one thing
"We all go a little mad sometimes..."

[Pre-Chorus: Spencer Charnas, Spoken Word, Ricky Armellino]
She's crazy, I must confess
"Listen to mother"
It's always me cleaning up her mess...
(Up her mess!)
