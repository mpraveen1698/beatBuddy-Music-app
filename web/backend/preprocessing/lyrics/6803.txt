23 ContributorsDreams, Pt. II Lyrics[Verse]
My heart rages around like an ocean in my head
Because there are so many things that I left unsaid

[Chorus]
I can almost feel you wa-, wa-, walking in the distance
But I know that it's not reality
If you are echoing around
Inside these parallel dimensions
All along, know I'll find you in my dreams
(I'll find you in my-)

[Drop]
I'll find you in my dreams
(Find you in my)
Yeah, yeah, yeah walking in the distance
That it's not reality

[Verse]
My heart rages around like an ocean in my head

[Chorus]
I can almost feel you wa-, wa-, walking in the distance
But I know that it's not reality
If you are echoing around
Inside these parallel dimensions
All along, know I'll find you in my dreams
(I'll find you in my)

Walking in the distance (distance)
That it's not reality
I'll find you in my

[Drop]
I'll find you in my dreams
(Find you in my)
Yeah, yeah, yeah walking in the distance
That it's not reality

[Outro]
I can almost feel you wa-, wa-, walking in the distance
But I know that it's not realityEmbed Dreams pt. II Dreams pt. II Sara Skinner;Lost Sky edm
