6 Contributors​in my head Lyrics[Chorus]
Got you in my head now (Head now)
Had 4, 5 drinks then I got you in my bed now (Oh, no)
Would've been on my way, but I'm with you instead now (Right here)
Losin' your focus, but I need you here now
Send shots my way, fuck that boy, you ain't no saint
Oh, when the liquor get pourin' you really start actin' your age
Oh, backflip then switch, boy, you don't even mean what you say
Tell me I'm messed up, but how could you blame me
Look at what you made me

[Verse 1]
Out of breath
Face blue but I'm seein' red
I was strong, feelin' at my best
The thought of you make me second guess
Weighing on me, pressure on mе
Yeah, I admit I get needy
Got the rеceipts, soon as I leave
All of a sudden you need me
Babe (Babe), I've been up all night feelin' so damaged (So damaged)
Maybe I should spend less time with you gettin' caught up
Told myself that I'm through (Through)
Then I'm back here with you (You)
Fuck it, give me round two
Love that thing that you do, yeah, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Got you in my head now (Head now)
Had 4, 5 drinks then I got you in my bed now (Oh, no)
Would've been on my way, but I'm with you instead now (Right here)
Losing your focus, but I need you here now
Send shots my way, fuck that boy, you ain't no saint
Oh, when the liquor get pourin' you really start actin' your age
Oh, backflip then switch, boy, you don't even mean what you say
Tell me I'm messed up, but how could you blame me
Look at what you made me

[Verse 2]
We live fast, run it up
Me, my girls, run amuck
I touch down, turn it up
You out here looking stuck, yeah
I'ma have you pressed lonely all night
Send a drunk text, try to ruin my night
Wish you ain't said it, you gon' regret it
That shit you pulling don't fit my aesthetic
Watch what I do (Do)
You've been watchin' my moves (Moves)
Watch how I do (Watch how I do)
Yeah, you know I can't lose (I can't lose)
Been callin' my phone tryna waste my time
Knowin' if I pick up, then it's one more time
What's one more time?
[Chorus]
Got you in my head now (Head now)
Had 4, 5 drinks then I got you in my bed now (Oh, no)
Would've been on my way, but I'm with you instead now (Right here)
Losing your focus, but I need you here now
Send shots my way, fuck that boy, you ain't no saint
Oh, when the liquor get pourin' you really start actin' your age
Oh, backflip then switch, boy, you don't even mean what you say
Tell me I'm messed up, but how could you blame me
Look at what you made meEmbed in my head i hope u see this thuy chill
