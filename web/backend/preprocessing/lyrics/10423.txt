7 ContributorsIâ€™m Am so Sad... I Am so Very Very Sad Lyrics[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty]
Being in love with you seems like a really bad idea, I-I
Being in love with you seems like a really bad idea, I-I

[Chorus: Alrahim Wright III]
Life ain't the same, I feel the pain
I go insane, I go insane
I cannot change, I cannot change
Feel like I'm stuck in my ways
Feel like I never can, never can change
Act like I'm good, but far from okay
Far from the saint, I need to be saved
Take me away, just take me away
'Cause
Life ain't the same, I feel the pain
I go insane, I go insane
I cannot change, I cannot change
Feel like I'm stuck in my ways
Feel like I never can, never can change
Act like I'm good, but far from okay
Far from the saint, I need to be saved
Take me away, just take me away
'Cause

Far from the saint, I need to be saved
Take me away, just take me away
