8 ContributorsMy Feelings Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wake up with your voice inside my head
I'm sleeping on your side of the bed
It don't feel like you're gone
I'm falling to pieces wondering
Why we didn't stop us shattering
Before it all came undone

[Pre-Chorus]
If the tears didn't fall and my heart didn't break
If the night would have gone my way
We'd still be here, we'd still be here

[Chorus]
If I picked up your call
When you begged me to stay
If your love didn't ricochet
We'd still bе here
Right herе
We'd still be here

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Your things in the same place that you left
Nothing fills the empty in my chest
It ain't beating like before
Play all of the fights over again
All we could have said and done different
It leaves me hurtin' more
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
If the tears didn't fall and my heart didn't break
If the night would have gone my way
We'd still be here, we'd still be here

[Chorus]
If I picked up your call
When you begged me to stay
If your love didn't ricochet
We'd still be here
Right here
We'd still be here

[Outro]
We'd still be hereEmbed My Feelings My Feelings Serhat Durmus;Georgia Ku turkish
