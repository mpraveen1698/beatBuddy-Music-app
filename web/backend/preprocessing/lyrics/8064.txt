12 ContributorsLosing Me Lyrics[Verse 1: JP Cooper]
Wanna lie to you
Say  I'm doing so well
Show  you photos too to prove that I've been doing so well
Wanna hide the truth, wanna dress up hell and heaven like we all try to do

[Pre-Chorus 1: JP Cooper]
I'm scared to ca-ca-call you back
I'm  not goo-goo-good at trying
To  te-te-tell you that I'm not doing okay
But I'm dying to hear you say

[Chorus 1: Gabrielle Aplin & JP Cooper, Gabrielle Aplin, JP Cooper]
Just  take a breath, love
Fill your lungs up
Rest your head, there's no sense in losing sleep
You can break down
Let  your worst out
Lose your temper, but you're not losing me-e-e-e-e (Take a breath, love)
You're not losing me-e-e-e-e (You can break down)
Oh, oh

[Verse 2: Gabrielle Aplin, JP Cooper]
Don't wanna cry to you
I was feeling so good
Take another sip, then hit the bottom like I knew that I would (Oh)
All the things we do, when we dress up pain like heaven in a moment of truth

I wanna ca-ca-call you back (Oh)
I'm not goo-goo-good at trying
To te-te-tell you that I'm not doing okay
But I'm dying to hear you say

[Chorus 1: Gabrielle Aplin & JP Cooper, Gabrielle Aplin]
Just take a breath, love
Fill your lungs up
Rest your head, there's no sense in losing sleep
You can break down
Let your worst out
Lose your temper, but you're not losing me-e-e-e-e (Take a breath, love)
You're not losing me-e-e-e-e (You can break down)

[Bridge: Gabrielle Aplin]
You could be so happy, then it suddenly turns
No one can explain it and you don't have the words
I can see you're trying, I can see that it hurts
I can see you're trying, I can see that it hurts

[Chorus 2: Gabrielle Aplin & JP Cooper, Gabrielle Aplin]
Just take a breath, love
Fill your lungs up
Rest your head, there's no sense in losing sleep (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You can break down
Let your worst out
Lose your temper, but you're not losing me (Ooh)
Like a bed that you could fall in when you're broken
I'm the air that's running through our window open
Take a breath, love
Fill your lungs up
Rest your head 'cause you're not losing me-e-e-e-e (Mmm)
You're not losing me-e-e-e-e4Embed Losing Me Dear Happy Gabrielle Aplin;JP Cooper singer-songwriter
