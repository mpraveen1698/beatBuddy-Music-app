8 ContributorsLiberation LyricsWhat happens when life breaks down
When there is systemic contradiction?
My name symbolized all that was corrupt to society
His name symbolized all that was pure
And I was being held in the embrace of a man who was pure
And these inviolable sanctities were preserved in those ten words
And it is the de-sacralization of all of these
That has put us in the mess that we find ourselves
Isn't it true, alas it is much worse
A person may end up believing in anything

Think of what it is when God himself puts his arms around you and says "Welcome home"

And I was being held in the embrace of a man who was pure
