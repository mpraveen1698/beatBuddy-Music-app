18 ContributorsDreams of You Lyrics[Intro: Brennan Savage]
I need some time to rest my head
I lay my back down on your bed
Down on your bed
And you'll find me dead

[Verse 1: Brennan Savage]
I need some time to rest my head
I lay my back down on your bed
I start to nod and I pray to God
That I won't wake up and you'll find me dead
But there's some times that change my mind
You get me high, make me feel alive
On faded nights when I feel I'm crazy
You're the only one who saves me from myself
I tear you down, but you help me grow
I broke your heart, but you still won't go
Just chew me up, spit me out
'Cause I deserve to feel my bones break

[Verse 2: Killstation]
Don't wanna be the one letting you down
I need to leave, you won't let me today
I try to scream, but I can't make a sound
Guess that I really got nothing to say
Don't wanna be the one letting you down
I need to leave, you won't let me today
I try to scream, but I can't make a sound
Guess that I really got nothing to say
You might also like[Bridge: Killstation]
I guess that I really got nothing to say
I guess that I really got nothing to say
I guess that I really got nothing to say
[Chorus: Killstation]
I've been having dreams of you
Sleeping with someone that's not me
I don't know what to do
Our love will rot too early
I've been having dreams of you (Dreams of you)
Sleeping with someone that's not me
I don't know what to do (What to do)
Our love will rot too early
[Outro: Killstation]
I've been having dreams of you
Sleeping with someone that's not me
I don't know what to do
Our love will rot too early13Embed Dreams of You Tragedy Brennan Savage;Killstation emo
