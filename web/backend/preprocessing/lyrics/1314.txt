6 ContributorsMind Over Matter (Reprise) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mind over matter
Does it matter to any of us?
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love
I missed that train, New York city, it rains
Fly to East L.A. in big jet planes
(You know you're on my mind)

[Chorus]
And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

[Verse 2]
Mind over matter
I'm in tatters thinkin' 'bout her
Taste my disaster (My disaster)
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow, Tokyo snows
Go to watch the show, curtain's closed
(I'm watching you this time)
You might also like[Chorus]
And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

[Bridge]
I missed that train, New York City it rains
Fly to East L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
All the lights aglow, Tokyo snows
Go to watch the show, curtain's closed
(Mind over matter)
You know you're on my mind

[Chorus]
And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
And if the world don't break
[Outro]
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
