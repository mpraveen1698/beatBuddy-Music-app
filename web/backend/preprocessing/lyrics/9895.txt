You say you know just who I am
But you can't imagine
What waits for you across the line
You thought you had me

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm still here standing
And I'm tired of backing down

[Chorus]
And I'm here now feeling the pain
Of a thousand hearts
Been to hell and back again
I won't take this

[Verse 2]
You try so hard to bring me down
You can't break the broken
You still don't seem to understand
It's your turn to see just

[Pre-Chorus]
How it feels to be me
How it feels to be knocked down
You might also like[Chorus]
And you're here now feeling the pain
Of a thousand hearts
You've been to hell and back again
You can't take this

[Bridge]
Remember
This feeling

[Pre-Chorus]
How it feels to be alive
Now you see me through my eyes

[Chorus]
And we're here now feeling the beat
Of a thousand hearts
Coming back to life again
We can make it

[Outro]
Remember
This feeling
