25 ContributorsBleed the Freak Lyrics[Intro]
My cup runneth over
Like blood from a stone

[Chorus]
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me

[Verse 1]
When the pig runs slower (Slower)
Let the arrow fly (Fly)
When the sin lies bolder (Bolder)
I'll pluck out thine eye (I'll pluck out thine eye)

[Chorus]
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me

[Verse 2]
If you scorn my lover (Lover)
Satan got your thigh (Thigh)
If you steal in hunger (Hunger)
I will kick you when you try (When you try)
You might also like[Chorus]
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Ah...
All these things that you've done for me
Have left me so fucking tired, ooh
I'm not saying that you haven't done a lot of good
But if there's one thing you can do
You can bleed for me, bleed for me (Ah!)

[Chorus]
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me4Embed Bleed The Freak Facelift Alice In Chains grunge
