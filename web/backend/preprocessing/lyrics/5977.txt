15 ContributorsWar With Heaven Lyrics[Verse 1]
Did you get over me?
It's been a long time now
Feels like eternity
It's only been 2 hours
You out here in them streets
And I got a lot to say
Damn, I'm missin' my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Feels like everybody's tellin' me I'm doin' too much
And I know I can be dramatic when I want, but so what?
And not to cause a panic, but I'm needin' your love
I can't help but feel a way when you're away, yeah
(I just might)

[Chorus]
Might go to war with Heaven
For keepin' me away from you, so long, eh-eh-eh
Might go to war with Heaven
'Cause I don't know what else I'd do
If I was away from you, so long

[Verse 2]
These drinks take over me
They're messin' with my head
My insecurities
'Cause you ain't in my bed
My bed, I got a place for you
Really gotta get away from you
It ain't easy, what's a man to do?
What's a man to do?

Feels like everybody's tellin' me I'm doin' too much
And I know I can be dramatic when I want, but so what?
And not to cause a panic, but I'm needin' your love
I can't help but feel a way when you're away, yeah
(I just might)

[Chorus]
Might go to war with Heaven
For keepin' me away from you, so long, eh-eh-eh
Might go to war with Heaven
'Cause I don't know what else I'd do
If I was away from you, so long

[Post-Chorus]
Sha-na-na, na-na
Sha-na-na, na-na, oh-oh
Sha-na-na, na-na
Sha-na-na, na-na, so long
Sha-na-na, na-na
Sha-na-na, na-na, oh-oh
'Cause I don't know what else I'd do
If I was away from you, so long3Embed War With Heaven Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings: The Album keshi chill
