8 ContributorsThe Sea Lyrics[Verse 1]
Flocking to the sea
Crowds of people wait for me
Seagulls scavenge, steal ice cream
Worries vanish within my dream

[Chorus]
I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Livin' free

I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Livin' free

[Verse 2]
Fishing boats sail past the shore
No singing mayday anymore
The sun is shining, the water's clear
Just you and I'll walk along the pier

[Chorus]
I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Livin' free
You might also likeI left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Livin' free

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
A cool breeze flows but mind the wasp
Some get stung it's worth the cost
I'd love to stay, the city calls me home
More hassles, fuss and lies on the phone

[Chorus]
I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Livin' free

I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Livin' free

I left my soul there
Down by the sea
I lost control here
Livin' free
[Outro]
I left my soul there
Down by the sea, yeah
I lost control here
Livin'
Livin'
And I, livin'
By the seaEmbed The Sea Big Calm Morcheeba trip-hop
