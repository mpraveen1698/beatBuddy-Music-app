I'm just a stranger
With a twisted smile and a wandering eye
Your heart is in danger
Come close now, let me tell you a lie

[Chorus]
Wild child
You got me runnin' through the turnstile
Baby girl, we better make it worthwhile
You're gonna get my love today, yeah

[Verse 2]
You are a sweet dream
With a tender heart and a beautiful smile
But things aren't what they seem
So I'll let you go and dream for a while

[Chorus]
Wild child
You got me coming outta exile
Baby girl, you know I'm liking your style
You're gonna get my love today, yeah

I just wanna hold you at the end of every day
Girl, I want to please you, oh, I'm needing you to stay
The sun is gonna shine if you would just come out and play
Baby, won't you show me your wild child ways?

[Chorus]
Wild child
You got me runnin' through the turnstile
Baby girl, we better make it worthwhile
You're gonna get my love today, yeah
Wild child
You got me coming outta exile
Baby girl, you know I'm liking your style
You're gonna get my love today, yeah3Embed Wild Child Dropout Boogie The Black Keys alt-rock
