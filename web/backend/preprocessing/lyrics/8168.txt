Cocaine on the toilet seat 5 AM
X pills and that liquor, shit hit the fan
OD'd on the plane when the private land
Ain't even touch base, ain't had time to cram
We do them drugs just to cut the time
She love me but she know she ain't mine
Still take them shits and nod off the bed
I live through her too, cause her, she dead
Monday magic poison me with drugs
Devil's advocate with Cupid's love
Express with tattoo, she express with cuts
Stress like the blue, ain't know what the fuck

[Verse]
Pull it together
Drag it out, get on, girl
It's right now or never
Cool with the shit now but I could always do better
Spend what I give you now
Cash out on some night time endeavour

[Chorus]
Cocaine on the toilet seat 5 AM
X pills and that liquor, shit hit the fan
OD'd on the plane when the private land
Ain't even touch base, ain't had time to cram
We do them drugs just to cut the time
She love me but she know she ain't mine
Still take them shits and nod off the bed
I live through her too, cause her, she dead
Monday magic poison me with drugs
Devil's advocate with Cupid's love
Express with tattoo, she express with cuts
Stress like the blue, ain't know what the fuck

Drugs in the drink been keeping me awake
Mosh with my shit until you feel the pain pain pain pain
Rock star, feel like I'm the damn chain chain chain
I ain't 'bout the shit but y'all around me I know bang bang bang3Embed Monday Magic Monday Magic Lil Cobaine soul
