[Verse 1]
I wanted love, I needed love
Most of all, most of all
Someone said true love was dead
And I'm bound to fall, bound to fall for you
Oh, what can I do? Yeah

[Verse 2]
Take my badge but my heart remains
Lovin' you, baby child
Tighten up on your reins
You are runnin' wild, runnin' wild, it's true

[Instrumental Chorus]

It's times like these I need relief
Please show me how, oh, show me how to get right
Yeah, it's out of sight

[Verse 4]

Now I let the others pass, I've come around
Oh, come around, 'cause I've found

Livin' just to keep goin', goin' just to be sane
All the while not knowin', it's such a shame
I don't need to get steady, I know just how I feel
Tellin' you to be ready, my dear37Embed Tighten Up Brothers (Deluxe Remastered Anniversary Edition) The Black Keys blues
