You're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
You keep me close

[Verse 1]
I got front row seats for the parkside livin'
Feel like the one, but I'm one in a billion
Teenage cynical, and I don't really know
What's the point of livin' if my heart gets broken?
Drivin' on the road, waiting for head-on collision
Springtime funeral
I miss you, but I'd rather be alone
To keep me from

[Pre-Chorus]
Heartbreaks, headaches
The doctor says I'm diagnosed with
Shit days, mistakes
But I'll be fine
But I'll be fine

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
When I've been miserable
And it takes forever
To let my brain get better
You keep me close
You keep me close
You might also like[Verse 2]
Window seats as the plane starts leavin'
Miss those streets where my knees were bleedin'
Homesick veteran
I left my bed again
Oh, lookin' for

[Pre-Chorus]
Heartbreaks, headaches
The doctor says I'm diagnosed with
Shit days, mistakes
But I'll be fine
But I'll be fine

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
When I've been miserable
And it takes forever
To let my brain get better
You keep me close
You keep me close

[Bridge]
Please, never leave me 'cause I'm barely holdin' on
You give me a reason to keep on breathin'
[Chorus]
'Cause you're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
When I've been miserable
And it takes forever
To let my brain get better
You keep me close, oh woah
You keep me close

[Outro]
I know you hear me (Close)
Yeah (Close)
