Every time I stare into the sun
Trying to find a reason to go on
All I ever get is burned and blind
Until the sky bleeds the pouring rain

[Verse 2]
When you came along, the time was right
Pulled me like an apple, red and ripe
Wasn't very long, you took a bite
And did me wrong, and it serves me right

[Chorus]
And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go round again gain

[Verse 3]
Every little key unlocks the door
Every little secret has a lie
Try to take a picture of the sun
And it won't help you to see the light

[Verse 4]
Every little word upon your lips
Makes a little cut where blood pours out
Every little drop of blood, a kiss
That I won't miss, not for anything
You might also like[Chorus]
And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go round again

[Bridge]
Every single feeling tells me this is leading
To a heart in broken little pieces
And you know I need this
Like a hole in the head

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Every single feeling tells me this is leading
To a heart in broken little pieces
And you know I need this
Like a hole...

[Chorus]
And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go round again
And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go round again
[Outro]
Here we go round again
Here we go round again
Here we go round again4Embed Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart Higher Truth Chris Cornell grunge
