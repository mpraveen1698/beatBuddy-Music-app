You show me love then spit in my face
Making your money off all of my pain
You put an eagle inside of a cage
And you think I'm not strong enough to escape
But I refuse to let you make me feel like I can't fly
Not only will I soar again, I'll own the fucking sky, yeah

[Chorus]
So I put my middle finger up
I'm done being your slave
My generation's had enough
And you should be afraid
Oh-whoa, oh, not your prisoner
Oh-whoa, oh, better listen when I say
I put my middle finger up
I'm done being your slave

[Verse 2]
You couldn't even look me in the eye
When you let me go and then left me to die
But there was no question that I would survive
An artist on fire is one that's alive
You can't surround a lion with a bunch of lazy sheep
The one thing about royalty is that we love to feast, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
So I put my middle finger up
I'm done being your slave
My generation's had enough
And you should be afraid
Oh-whoa, oh, not your prisoner
Oh-whoa, oh, better listen when I say
I put my middle finger up
I'm done being your slave

[Bridge]
Living like a riot
Setting off the sirens
Fists are clenched, I'm fighting
Soul has been ignited
Ain't got time for dyin'
I'm too busy thrivin'
More than just survivin'
Heart is beating violent
Living like a riot
Setting off the sirens
Fists are clenched, I'm fighting
Soul has been ignited
Ain't got time for dyin'
I'm too busy thrivin'
More than just survivin'
Heart is beating violent
[Chorus]
So I put my middle finger up
I'm done being your slave
My generation's had enough
And you should be afraid
Oh-whoa, oh, not your prisoner
Oh-whoa, oh, better listen when I say
I put my middle finger up
I'm done being your slave22Embed Middle Finger Middle Finger - Single Bohnes alt-rock
