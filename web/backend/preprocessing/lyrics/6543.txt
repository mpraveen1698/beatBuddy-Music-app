Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do, about you now

Backbeat, the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
That they're gonna give it back to you
I'm sure you've heard it all bеfore
But you never rеally had a doubt
That they're gonna give it back to you
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Say maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall
