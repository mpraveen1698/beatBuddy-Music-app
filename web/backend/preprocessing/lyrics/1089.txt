Can I call you baby? Can you be my friend?
Can you be my lover up until the very end?
Let me show you love, oh, no pretend
Stick by my side even when the world is caving in, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, don't, don't you worry
I'll be there whenever you want me

Know I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst

I can fill those places in your heart no one else can
Let me show you love, oh, no pretend, yeah
