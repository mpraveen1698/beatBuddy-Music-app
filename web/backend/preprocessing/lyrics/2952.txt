She said, "Baby, I'm afraid to fall in love
Cause what if it's not reciprocated?"
I told her, "Don't rush girl, dont you rush
Guess it's all a game of patience."

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "What if I dive deep?
Will you come in after me?
Would you share your flaws with me? Let me know."
I told her, "Thinking is all wrong
Love will happen when it wants
I know it hurts sometimes, but don't let it go."

[Chorus]
'Cause I want you, I want you, I want- I want you
'Cause I want you, I want you, I want- I want you

[Verse 2]
She said, "What if I tell you all the things I've done?
Would you run away from me?"
I told her, "Baby, we all got bags full of shit that we don't want
But I can't unpack it for you, baby."

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "What if I dive deep?
Will you come in after me?
Would you share your flaws with me? Let me know."
I told her, "Thinking is all wrong
Love will happen when it wants
I know it hurts sometimes, but don't let it go."
