Crack that whip, give the past a slip
Step on a crack, break your momma's back

[Chorus: Gerald Casale & Mark Mothersbaugh]
When a problem comes along, you must whip it
Before the cream sets out too long, you must whip it
When something's going wrong, you must whip it

[Post-Chorus: Mark Mothersbaugh]
Now whip it into shape, shape it up, get straight
Go forward, move ahead, try to detect it, it's not too late
To whip it, whip it good

[Chorus: Gerald Casale & Mark Mothersbaugh]
When a good time turns around, you must whip it
You will never live it down unless you whip it
No one gets away until they whip it

[Bridge: Mark Mothersbaugh]
I say whip it, whip it good
I say whip it, whip it good
