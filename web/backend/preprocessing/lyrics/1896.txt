There's a moment
In your bones when
When the fire takes over
Blood is running
Heart is pumping
As the battle gets closer
Ooh, they can say what they want now
Ooh, 'cause we'll be screaming out

[Chorus]
We can be heroes everywhere we go
We can have all that we ever want
Swinging like Ali, knocking out bodies
Standing on top like a champion
Keep your silver, give me that gold
You'll remember when I say
We can be heroes everywhere we go
Keeping us down is impossible
'Cause we're unstoppable

[Post-Chorus]
Oh whoa, we're unstoppable
Oh whoa, we're unstoppable

[Verse 2]
Every spotlight
Every sound byte
Everybody who gave up
Is just the fuel for
Wanting it more
Than anybody against us
Ooh, they can say what they want now
Ooh, 'cause we'll be screaming out

Keeping us down is impossible
