2 ContributorsGood For Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I want to want it, but I can't let go
I'm wide awake and you're sleeping alone
All of the drama, I've been here before
Why do I push you away when I need you the most

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me something sweet
But I'm hiding from it always running
You got me off my feet
But I'm scared of falling, scared of falling again

[Chorus]
Don't know what's good for me
Don't know what's good for me
Scared of falling, scared of falling again
Me
Don't know what's good for me

[Verse 2]
Don't want to go there but every time
I feel it coming, emotions on overdrive
This could be something, this could have been bright
But when I get close, I'm saying goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me something sweet
But I'm hiding from it always running
You got me off my feet
But I'm scared of falling, scared of falling again

Don't know what's good for me
Don't know what's good for me
Scared of falling, scared of falling again
Me
Don't know what's good for me
Don't know what's good forEmbed Good for Me (feat. Anna Straker) Good for Me (feat. Anna Straker) Jay Pryor;Coldabank;Anna Straker deep-house
