I could run
I could cry, I could plead
I could say it's never gonna get
Any better and leave
I could throw my hands up
I could fall to my knees
I could tell myself I'm strong enough
To give all the love that I need

[Chorus]
But I still need you
To ease my load
Hold me when the lightning strikes
Lead me home
When I don't know which way is right
Love me when it's hard
I promise that I'm not
Leaving from your side
And when I fall apart
Promise in the dark
You'll be my nightlight

[Build]
Ooh
You'll be my nightlight
Ooh
You'll be my nightlight
(Ooh)
You'll be my nightlight
(Ooh)
You'll be my nightlight

(You'll be my nightlight)
You'll be my nightlight
(You'll be my nightlight)

[Verse 2]
I could count
Every timе that I've fallen (Fallen)
Evеn when I'm in so deep
It gets hard to see, you're still all in
I've been lost
By myself in the darkness
Know that I can find my way
Even on the days when it's hardest

[Chorus]
But I still need you
To ease my load
Hold me when the lightning strikes
Lead me home
When I don't know which way is right
Love me when it's hard
I promise that I'm not
Leaving from your side
And when I fall apart
Promise in the dark
You'll be my nightlight
[Build]
Ooh
You'll be my nightlight
Ooh
You'll be my nightlight
(Ooh)
You'll be my nightlight
(Ooh)
You'll be my nightlight

[Drop]
(Ooh)
(You'll be my nightlight)
You'll be my nightlight
(Ooh)
(You'll be my nightlight)5Embed Nightlight Nightlight ILLENIUM;Annika Wells edm
