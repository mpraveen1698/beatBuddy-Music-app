3 ContributorsBlessings Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sunlight fell and reminded me that life can be
So gracious sometimes
And I felt like everything around me
Was connected somehow

[Verse 2]
At night I hear the rhythm of the ocean
As it breaks on the shore
And I think about all the things that
I am grateful for

[Chorus]
And they say, hold on to the ones you love
Keep 'em close to you
And they say, hold on to this time we have
And let the light shine through

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I get a little bit еmotional when
I see love unfold
Two hearts bound by rеflections of the memories
They'll forever hold

[Chorus]
And they say, hold on to the ones you love
Keep 'em close to you
And they say, hold on to this time we have
And let the light shine through

There are blessings all around you
Open up your eyes
Feel the sunlight fall upon you
Let it free your mind
There are blessings all around you
Take a step outside
Let your heart shine in a new light
See it come alive

[Chorus]
And they say, hold on to the ones you love
Keep 'em close to you
And they say, hold on to this time we have
And let the light shine throughEmbed Blessings Blessings Hollow Coves folk
