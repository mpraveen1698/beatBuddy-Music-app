3 ContributorsStay Young Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey now, could we stop the world tonight?
Just wanna lay down and feel your body close to mine
All I wanna hear you say is that we never gonna leave this place
But if we ever fade away, I hope you know

[Chorus]
I'm feeling so high when we're together
Yeah, let's make it last forever
We'll stay young, stay young
We are the perfect lovers
Don't care about the others
I wanna stay young, stay young with you

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna stay young
I wanna stay young with you

[Verse 2]
Hey now, we are young and wild and free
I just wanna shake out all the love inside of me
Underneath the golden sky we sit and watch the evening tide
I see the fire in your eyes and I gotta say

[Chorus]
I'm feeling so high when we're together
Yeah, let's make it last forever
We'll stay young, stay young
We are the perfect lovers
Don't care about the others
I wanna stay young, stay young with you

I wanna stay young

[Outro]
I'm feeling so high when we're together
Yeah, let's make it last forever
I wanna stay young, stay young with you1Embed Stay Young Stay Young Mike Perry;Tessa house
