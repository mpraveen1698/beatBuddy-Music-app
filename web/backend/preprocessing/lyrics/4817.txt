Impatient, just say it
Still waitin', for another round
New faces, I'm racin'
On foot, but I'll never make it home
Sixth street for the occasion
Can't take all of the changes
Blue moon in different phases
Blue moon in different places

[Verse]
Three hours, three months away
Go back but not the same
I don't want you to see me
'Cause I'm not what I seem
Why was everyone leaving?
Do we say what we mean?
Got the 9-5 and the bloodline
Better dress up for the date night
For the date night
Don't hit my cell
There's an unknown number on my phone
I don't need your help
Just let me lay down on the floor
I don't know myself
Not like the time I did before
No, no
You might also like[Chorus]
Impatient, just say it
Still waitin' for another round
New faces, I'm racin'
On foot, but I'll never make it home
Sixth street for the occasion
Can't take all of the changes
Blue moon in different phases
Blue moon in different places

[Bridge]
Tear me to pieces
I won't even feel it
You're not what I needed
Move on with the seasons

[Chorus]
Impatient, just say it
Still waitin' for another round
New faces, I'm racin'
On foot, but I'll never make it home
Sixth street for the occasion
Can't take all of the changes
Blue moon in different phases
Blue moon in different places10Embed blue bandaids keshi chill
