You know me the best, you know my worst
See me hurt, but you don't judge
That, right there, is the scariest feeling
Opening and closing up again
I've been hurt so I don't trust
Now here we are, staring at the ceiling

[Pre-Chorus: Zach]
I've said those words before but it was a lie
And you deserve to hear them a thousand times

[Chorus: Jack & Corbyn]
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?

[Verse 2: Daniel]
Isn't it amazing
How almost every line on our hands align
When your hand's in mine
It's like I'm whole again
Isn't that a sign?
I should speak my mind
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Zach]
I've said those words before but it was a lie
And you deserve to hear them a thousand times

[Chorus: Jack & Corbyn]
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say? (Woah, oh, yeah)

[Bridge: Jack]
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind
When I close my eyes

[Chorus: Corbyn & Jack]
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
[Outro: Corbyn, Jack & Daniel]
If all it is is eight letters
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind (It's only you)
When I close my eyes
If all it is is eight letters
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind (You)
When I close my eyes
If all it is is eight letters138Embed 8 Letters 8 Letters Why Don't We dance
