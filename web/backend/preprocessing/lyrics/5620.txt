31 ContributorsHear You Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's no one in town I know
You gave us some place to go
I never said thank you for that
I thought I might get one more chance

[Pre-Chorus]
What would you think of me now?
So lucky, so strong, so proud
I never said thank you for that
Now I'll never have a chance

[Chorus]
May angels lead you in
Hear you me, my friends
On sleepless roads the sleepless go
May angels lead you in

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
So, what would you think of me now?
So lucky, so strong, so proud
I never said thank you for that
Now I'll never have a chance
You might also like[Chorus]
May angels lead you in
Hear you me, my friends
On sleepless roads the sleepless go
May angels lead you in

[Bridge]
(May angels lead you in)
May angels lead you in
(May angels lead you in)
May angels lead you in

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
And if you were with me tonight
I'd sing to you just one more time
A song for a heart so big
God wouldn't let it live

[Chorus]
May angels lead you in
Hear you me, my friends
On sleepless roads the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
May angels lead you in
Hear you me, my friends
On sleepless roads the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
[Outro]
On sleepless roads the sleepless go
May angels lead you in12Embed Hear You Me Bleed American Jimmy Eat World punk-rock
