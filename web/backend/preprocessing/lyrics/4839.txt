Ah
Ah

[Verse 1]
I wanna be on the front line, knotted-up suit ties
Talkin' like a headstrong mama
Got a picture in your wallet, makin' me a habit
Wearin' your vintage T-shirt
Tied ribbons on your top hat, tellin' me I'm all that
Just like the girls from your hometown
Sweet-blooded and I'm stranded, see if I can stand it
Drinkin' in the shallow water

[Pre-Chorus]
Magnetic everything about you
You really got me now

[Chorus]
You do it to me so well
Hypnotic takin' over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talkin' in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean, dug so deep
Hypnotic takin' over me
Ah
Ah

White threads on my laces, stuck on the hinges
Swingin' the door to the backyard
Cut splinters, walk a tightrope, spun like a bandage
Touch on the outer surface
Bright eyes of the solstice, wherever your mind is
Headed for a freight train city
Locked up 'til you're moonlit, brushin' my hair back
Feelin' your lips on my cold neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Magnetic everything about you
You really got me now

[Chorus]
You do it to me so well
Hypnotic takin' over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talkin' in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean, dug so deep
Hypnotic takin' over me

[Bridge]
Ah
Hypnotic takin' over me
[Chorus]
You do it to me so well
Hypnotic takin' over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talkin' in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean, dug so deep
Hypnotic takin' over me

[Outro]
Ah
Hypnotic takin' over me
Ah
Hypnotic takin' over me
Ah
