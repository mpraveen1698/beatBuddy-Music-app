34 ContributorsLocket Lyrics[Verse 1]
I live in a house with a tin roof and
Every time it rains, I can feel my brain
It's moving back and forth
Upside down, east-west
Feeling and remembering everything you do

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I was up last night tossing and turning
Couldn't get to sleep and I slept through the morning
Need to clear my head and get out of the city
All alone in the jungle you'll find me

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and hear my secret
Deep, deep loving, hear my secret
Hear my secret, hear my secret

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I can hear the tremble below me
Pounding through the floor, my body so restless
It lives in the basement below some boxes
Makes me feel so strange and so thoughtless
So, maybe someday this roof will cave in
You'll find me on the floor looking at the stars
These walls are made of brick, plated in gold
But I'm still here growing so old

Close your eyes and hear my secret
Deep, deep loving, hear my secret
Hear my secret, hear my secret
Close your eyes and hear my secret
Deep, deep loving, hear my secret
Hear my secret, hear my secret
