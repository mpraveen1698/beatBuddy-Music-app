So full of sparkle and such light
Let me remind
You chose not to cry
It's all right
For your lover has come home
By your side I'll always stay
Never have to be alone
Never have to be alone
You never have to be alone
Pretty green eyes
So full of wonder and despair
It's all right to cry
For I'll be there to wipe your tears
And in your arms
Together we're in paradise
And it's so nice
You'll never have to be alone
Never have to be alone
Never have to be alone
Never have to be alone
Never have to be alone
Pretty green eyes
So full of sparkle and such light
Let me remind
You chose not to cry
It's all right
For your lover has come home
By your side I'll always stay
Never have to be alone
Never have to be alone
Never have to be alone
Pretty green eyes
So full of wonder and despair
It's all right to cry
For i'll be there to wipe your tears
And in your arms
Together we're in paradise
And its so nice
You'll never have to be alone
Never have to be, never have to be
Never have to, never have to be alone
Never have to be, never have to be
Never have to, never have to be alone
Never have to be, never have to be
Never have to, never have to be alone
Never have to be, never have to be
Never have to, never have to be aloneYou might also likeEmbed Pretty Green Eyes - Radio Edit Pretty Green Eyes (Remixes) Ultrabeat techno
