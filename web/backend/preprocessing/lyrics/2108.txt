Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Silk sheets and neon lights
Stayed up 'til 4 or 5
Think that it's kinda nice, underneath the moon 'til the sun arrives, yeah
Strummed songs on your guitar
Drove 'round in your jet black car
Got lost went too far, went too far

[Chorus]
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Five-foot, sweet with skin like caramel
Every time it feels brand new
Wish I could rewind the things we do
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Everything just seemed so real
Can't lie 'bout the way I feel
Might be head over heels, head over heels
Three nights no drama
Yeah, you're like no other, yeah
So, girl, do you wanna? (Do you wanna)
You might also like[Chorus]
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Five-foot, sweet with skin like caramel
Every time it feels brand new
Wish I could rewind the things we do (We do)
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle (Isabelle)
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Five-foot, sweet with skin like caramel
Every time it feels brand new
Wish I could rewind the things we do
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Every time it feels brand new
Wish I could rewind the things we do (Things we do)
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle
Now I'm wasting time with Isabelle5Embed Isabelle Isabelle Zach Hood songwriter
