Wake up, go to sleep, repeat infinite (Infinite)
Forever talking with nobody listening (Listening)
One day I'll wake up and see things are different (Different)
Hopes by the plenty, I don't get 'em, no difference (Difference)
I've been trying my best and I still can't shake it
I've been trying my hardest I've never really
Been too good at changing
Been too good at changing
Been too good at changingYou might also like8Embed RepeatInfinite BreathingExercise surrenderdorothy emo
