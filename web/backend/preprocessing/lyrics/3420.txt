56 ContributorsAlone Lyrics[Chorus: Ivri]
I wanna go far away from you
But I don't wanna know how it feels to be alone
Now I'm confused
I wanna go and be alone
But I don't wanna know how it feels
I wanna go and be alone
But I don't wanna know
Now I'm confused

[Verse 1: SadBoyProlific]
I'm empty and broken, what is the point?
Everything's dark 'cept the light from this joint
Lately, they say they hate the way I cope
It's hang from the clouds or hang from a rope
I've done some things for which I can't atone
I grab the blade and cut down past the bone
She'll never love me, I know the truth's ugly
I'll hide away and push everyone from me
In my mind, I face resistance
Wanna be alone, but I hate the distance
Honestly, I don't know what to think now
I know I'm not the best to be around
Wanna die, put me in a coffin
Pop twenty pills, hope nobody stops it
When I die, don't act like it's shocking
Gave you all the signs, now I'm done talking
You might also like[Chorus: lvri]
I wanna go and be alone
But I don't wanna know how it feels
I wanna go and be alone
But I don't wanna know
Now I'm confused
I wanna go and be alone
But I don't wanna know how it feels
I wanna go and be alone
But I don't wanna know
Now I'm confused

[Verse 2: SadBoyProlific]
I guess that I gotta go now
Feeling like a candle, one that's finna go out
Roll up the dope, I just need it to slow down
Vision turns black while I fade to the background
When I die, I know they won't miss me
Give it a week and then they will forget me
I live for the present, not future or past
Roll up a gram, I just wanna relax
Don't wanna be alone, but I know it's for the best
My head's like my room 'cause that shit is a mess
Catch me in the backyard sparking a blunt
I haven't felt like myself in months
Got too attached and now I feel stupid
I need to have a talk with Cupid
Snap in half all the arrows he shooting
I feel so goddamn foolish
[Chorus: Ivri]
I wanna go and be alone
But I don't wanna know how it feels
I wanna go and be alone
But I don't wanna know
Now I'm confused
I wanna go and be alone
But I don't wanna know how it feels
I wanna go and be alone
But I don't wanna know
Now I'm confused37Embed Alone Alone SadBoyProlific;Ivri sad
