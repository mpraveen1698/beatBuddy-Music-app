20 ContributorsBloom Later Lyrics[Intro: Field Medic]
Ooo, ooo

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford & Field Medic]
Leaving you is so hard to do
Keeps me blue 'til I (Ooo)
Every time you glow then I start to grow
Can't do it alone anymore in the dirt (Ooo)
Even when it rains, I need your little rays
Some things never change even when they hurt

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford & Field Medic]
Where you goin'? I'm too fast
You say whatchu doin'? Don't do that
Never been a liar, I'm a lilac and you are my sun
And every season I need you to come back

[Verse 2: Jesse Rutherford & Field Medic]
When you're gone, sky turns crimson
So I wait for the dawn 'til I (Ooo)
Every time you shine, you help me define
How to remind myself what it's worth (Ooo)
Even when it rains, I need your little rays
Some things never change even when they hurt

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford & Field Medic]
Where you goin'? I'm too fast
You say whatchu doin'? Don't do that
Never been a liar, baby, I'm a lilac and you are my sun
And every season I need you to keep glowing
You might also like[Bridge: Jesse Rutherford & Field Medic]
Come back, glowing
Come back, glowing
Come back, glowing
Come back

[Outro: Field Medic]
Where you goin'? I'm too fast
You say whatchu doin'? Don't do that
Never been a liar, baby, I'm lilac and you are my sun
And every season I need you to come back15Embed Bloom Later & Jesse alternative
