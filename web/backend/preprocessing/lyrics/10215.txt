12 ContributorsShadows Lyrics[Verse 1]
I thought you'd know what came to pass, this love is falling down
But falling leaves hang on for life as time is ticking on
I wait and see the fire burn, it's burning to the ground
Wake from the dream, without the hurt, the journey's turning 'round

[Chorus]
Save me, save me from the unknown
While I daydream, I leave this world to follow
My footsteps are sinking to the hollows
I can retrace the memories in my shadows

[Verse 2]
Consider that my time away was working for the soul
I studied all I had to face, the fear inside me grows

[Chorus]
Save mе, save me from the unknown
Whilе I daydream, I leave this world to follow
My footsteps are sinking to the hollows
I can retrace the memories in my shadows

[Bridge]
I leave, leave, leave

[Chorus]
Save me, save me from the unknown
While I daydream, I leave this world to follow
My footsteps are sinking to the hollows
I can retrace the memories in my shadowsYou might also likeEmbed Shadows Fragments Bonobo;Jordan Rakei trip-hop
