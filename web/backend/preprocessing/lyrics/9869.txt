1 ContributorFast Car LyricsYou and I
Get somewhere

[Verse 1]
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living
You and I can both get jobs
Maybe together we can get somewhere

[Chorus]
You and I
Get somewhere

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we can make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we’ll makе something
Me, myself, I got nothing to provе
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working in a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit a money
Won’t have to drive too fast
Cross the borse and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living
You might also like[Chorus]
You and I
Get somewhere

[Verse 3]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
Won’t have to drive too fast
Cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living
You and I can both get jobs
Maybe together we can get somewhere

[Outro]
You and I
