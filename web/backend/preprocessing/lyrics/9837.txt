Baby, take the highway

[Verse 1]
No going down
No cutting out
The sun comes up before you go
My baby's gone
My hollow soul
I feel a cold wind start to blow

[Chorus]
Every little stop sign
All the red lights like
A preacher on a Saturday night
The devils in the details
Pretty little females
Tell me all your sweet, sweet lies
I can't slow down, it's so damn loud
Let's burn this town alive
Ooh, pocketful of moonshine
Countin' all the white lies
Time to take the highway, highway, highway

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, take the highway
I'ma take the highway

My bleeding heart
It feels no pain
Too many sins to
Wash away
Into the dark
And through the rain
Together we go
We go insane

[Chorus]
Every little stop sign
All the red lights like
A preacher on a Saturday night
The devils in the details
Pretty little females
Tell me all your sweet, sweet lies
I can't slow down, it's so damn loud
Let's burn this town alive
Ooh, pocketful of moonshine
Countin' all the white lies
Time to take the highway, highway, highway

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, take the highway
I'ma take the highway
[Bridge]
Highway, highway
I'ma take the highway
I'ma take the highway
Highway, highway
I'ma take the highway
I'ma take the highway
Highway, highway (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Every little stop sign
All the red lights like
A preacher on a Saturday night
The devils in the details
Pretty little females
Tell me all your sweet, sweet lies
I can't slow down, it's so damn loud
Let's burn this town alive
Ooh, pocketful of moonshine
Countin' all the white lies
Time to take the highway, highway, highway

[Outro]
Baby, take the highway
I'ma take the highway1Embed Highway Erase You Bleeker hard-rock
