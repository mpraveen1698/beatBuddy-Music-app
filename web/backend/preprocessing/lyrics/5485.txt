3 ContributorsSo Sick Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
It's ridiculous
It's been months and for some reason
I just can't get over us
And I'm stronger than this
Enough is enough
No more walking 'round with my head down
I'm so over being blue, cryin' over you

[Chorus]
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Post-Chorus]
Said I'm so sick of love songs
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory
And how every song reminds me of what used to be

[Chorus]
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Post-Chorus]
Said I'm so sick of love songs
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Chorus]
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?Embed So Sick So Sick JubÃ«l swedish
