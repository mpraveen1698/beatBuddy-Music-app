4 ContributorsAfterbloom Lyrics[Intro]
(Da-da-da-da-da)

[Verse 1]
Dripping diamonds from your eyes
Damn you're even looking lovely when you cry
Air so heavy you could cut it with a knife
With a knife

[Bridge]
I'm still mesmerized
When I should be running for my life

[Pre-Drop]
Caught up in the after bloom with you
Hate that you're so beautiful here too
'Cause darling, even in the ending
There's no pretending
You're not breaking my heart pretty too

[Drop]
Mhh, da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Mhh, da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Mhh, da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Mhh, da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da

Press in your petals dry
Try to keep a piece of you even though we died
I'm still your biggest fan, biggest fan for life
Diamond boy and silver lines
Memory gets me high

[Bridge]
I'm still hypnotized
When I should be running for my life

[Pre-Drop]
Caught up in the after bloom with you
Hate that you're so beautiful here too
'Cause darling even in the ending
There's no pretending
You're not breaking my heart pretty too
After bloom with you

[Drop]
Mhh, da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Mhh, da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Mhh, da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Mhh, da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da
After bloom with you (Uh-whoo)
After bloom with you (Uh-whoo)
[Outro]
Caught up in the after bloom with you
Hate that you're so beautiful here too
'Cause darling even in the ending
There's no pretending
You're not breaking my heart pretty too
After bloom with youEmbed Afterbloom (feat. Deza) Afterbloom (feat. Deza) MOTi;Gustavo Dotch;Deza progressive-house
