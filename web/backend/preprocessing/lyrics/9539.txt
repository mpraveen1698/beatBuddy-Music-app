1 ContributorBlackheart Lyrics[Verse 1: Fat Dolsk]
At the seams, yeah I'm breaking (yeah)
Maybe go a little crazy, yeah
Think about shit, it don't make sense
But I ain't gon' stop 'til you pay me up
Some say that I'm lazy
Some stay on the hating
Some stay I bit off the sound
But I'm only all the things you make me
Why you think you can break me?
Yeah, now I feel a little jaded
I just stick to myself, and I'm on my own bis'
And I sit back and laugh that I made it
You just sit where you want and you whine like a bitch
I been dreaming this life back when I was a kid
I just jot all the words that me up in my head
I'm just hoping that all my thoughts are said

[Pre-Chorus: Fat Dolsk]
(Now I'm all by myself again, yeah, yeah)
(Now I'm all by myself again, yеah)
(I guess I'm living with a-)

[Chorus: Fat Dolsk]
Living with a blackheart (Blackheart)
Living by thе black card
Walked up in the game and I took it like an asshole
Stole that motherfucker and I whipped it like in NASCAR
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Living with a blackheart (Blackheart)
Living by the black card
Walked up in the game and I took it like an asshole
Stole that motherfucker and I whipped it like in NASCAR
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

Living with a heart made of blackness
Relapse with a pact, I'm an addict
These motherfuckers jumping and panicking
I dump all the fucking tablets by the cabinet
I'm going mad again
Hot froze like a motherfucking mannequin
Fat Dolsk blowing up like the Taliban
Kansas kid and Mr. Minneapolis getting back to shenanigans
Black heart got a black heart
Not much, gotta keep it on padlock
Russian roulette, hoping I can really his the jackpot
Clip, bang, that's a motherfucking snapshot
Fake fuck, you a strapping on shit
No cap, all facts, I'm a crack-rock kid
And I make it look easy, I snap on hits
I could rap all day, think my laptop spit
But I don't, and I won't ever
So I flow like the cold in [?]
Working home like it's Covid
I'm socially distant to bitches
I'm a whole 'nother cold brother
Man, you shoulda known better
Blackheart, so I'm a fucking go-getter
Run up the score, [?] go tenant
Summing up Dolsk, brothers forever
[Pre-Chorus: Fat Dolsk]
(Now I'm all by myself again, yeah, yeah)
(Now I'm all by myself again, yeah)
(I guess I'm living with a-)

[Chorus: Fat Dolsk]
Living with a blackheart (Blackheart)
Living by the black card
Walked up in the game and I took it like an asshole
Stole that motherfucker and I whipped it like in NASCAR
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Living with a blackheart (Blackheart)
Living by the black card
Walked up in the game and I took it like an asshole
Stole that motherfucker and I whipped it like in NASCAR
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)Embed Dreamin (with blackbear) Pressure The Score;blackbear alt-rock
