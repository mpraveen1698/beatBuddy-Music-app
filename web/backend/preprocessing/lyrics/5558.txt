26 ContributorsPlease Never Fall in Love Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
Could've been one lonely night
Just like the others
But you lit up my life
This is what it's like to be lovers

[Pre-Chorus]
You and me need never be
Lonely again
Spin with me endlessly
Or at least until the end

[Chorus]
Please never fall in love again
Oh, please never fall in love again

[Verse 2]
And if some other guy catches your eye
Please just text me your goodbye
You know I don't look pretty when I cry

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want that to be your final glimpse of me, baby
But if you could please return my Shrek DVDs maybe

[Chorus]
Please never fall in love again
Oh, please never fall in love again
[Outro]
