48 ContributorsFace Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey girl, you know you drive me crazy
One look puts the rhythm in my hand
Still, I'll never understand why you hang around
I see what's going down
Cover up with makeup in the mirror
Tell yourself, "It's never gonna happen again"
You cry alone, and then
He swears he loves you

[Chorus]
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now, as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found

[Verse 2]
A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
Every action in this world'll bear a consequence
If you wade around forever, you will surely drown
I see what's going down

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the way you go and say you're right again
Say you're right again, heed my lecture
You might also like[Chorus]
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found

[Post-Chorus]
Face down in the dirt, she said, "This doesn't hurt"
She said, "I finally had enough"
Face down in the dirt, she said, "This doesn't hurt"
She said, "I finally had enough"

[Bridge]
One day she will tell you that she has had enough
Itâ€™s coming 'round again

[Chorus]
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
[Post-Chorus]
Face down in the dirt, she said, "This doesn't hurt"
She said, "I finally had enough"33Embed Face Down Don't You Fake It The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus punk-rock
