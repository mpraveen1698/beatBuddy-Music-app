Накривил е калпачето ей така, па така
Нанагоре-нанадоле, ей така, па така
Накривил е калпачето ей така, па така
Нанагоре-нанадоле, ей така, па така

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
I've got a fever, don't breathe on me
I'm a believer in nobody
Won't let me leave 'cause I've seen something
Hope I don't sneeze, I don't *sneeze*
Really we just need to fear something
Only pretending to feel something
I know you're dying to run
I wanna turn you around

[Pre-Chorus: Alissa Salls]
Please remain calm
The end has arrived
We cannot save you
Enjoy the ride
This is the moment
You've been waiting for
Don't call it a warning
This is a war
You might also like[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayy
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, ayy, ayy
Move

[Verse 2: Oli Sykes]
I heard they need better signal
Put chip and pins in the needles
Quarantine all of those secrets
In that black hole you call a brain before it's too late
Really we just wanna scream something
Only pretend to believe something
I know you're baying for blood
I wanna turn you around (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus: Alissa Salls with Oli Sykes]
Please remain calm (Hey)
The end has arrived (Hey)
We cannot save you (Hey)
Enjoy the ride (Hey)
This is the moment (Hey)
You've been waiting for (Hey)
Don't call it a warning
This is a war
[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayy
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, ayy, ayy
It's the Parasite Eve (It's the Parasite Eve)
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayy
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will

[Breakdown: Oli Sykes]
You can board up your windows
You can lock up your doors, yeah
But you can't keep washing your hands
Of this shit anymore
When all the king's sources and all the king's friends
Don't know their arses from their pathogens
When life is a prison and death is the door
This ain't a warning
This is a war, war
This is a war, ayy, ayy, oh, oh
[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayy
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, ayy, ayy

[Post-Chorus: Oli Sykes]
It's the Parasite Eve (It's the Parasite Eve), ayy, ayy
It's the Parasite Eve, ayy, ayy
It's the Parasite Eve (Parasite Eve), ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Outro: Alissa Salls]

We cannot save you
