Ayy, yuh, yuh

Yeah, I just called you on your cellphone
I just called you on your cellphone, ayy
Yuh, ayy

[Chorus]
I just called up on your cellphone, ayy
I just checked up on your location then I saw you wasn't home, ayy
Now I'm runnin' out of breath just to make it home, ayy
Now I'm runnin' out of breath just to
I'm steady callin' to your cellphone, asking "Where you at?," ayy
Girl, you know I hate it when you leave, bring it back
Pray, I hope you bring your cellphone, keep and play it fair, ayy
Girl, you know I hate it when you leave, bring it back

[Verse]
Ayy, okay, see my life just an illusion, what we doin'? What's the motive?
I just spent too many goddamn bands in my pants
Can't control me, now you know me
Girl, I'm going somewhere that you never knowin', hold it slowly, ayy, damn
I'm the man in my city, baby girl, yeah, you know me
Went from thirty-people shows out the nationwide tourin'
Been like all around the globe, all these hoes say they adore me
But I had to bring it back, where's it at? Yeah, it's that
Yeah, I probably had to relapse off the flat
It was that, now I'm off it like no other
Motherfuck them if they hating on my squad
Damn, they broke, we flexin' hundreds
I just pulled up in that Ghost, with the most
On that fuck shit, what's up shit
I'm all up in the function, what's up shit
Now you hit my line as if you mine, bitch I'ma dead ya shit
Never could I love you like no other, never love a bitch
Never could I love you like no other, never love a bitch
