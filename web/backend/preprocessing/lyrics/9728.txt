3 ContributorsWhy You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I just feel like I am so impatient
I just want your love and I fucking hate waiting, yeah
And your kisses I'm craving (Craving)
But things just don't seem to workout for me now
Caught in a storm that I just can't get out, no

[Chorus]
Why you, why you say that you miss me? Yeah
But why you, why you gotta switch up on me like that?
You say, you're not ready for commitment (Commitment)
But why you gotta create all this distance?
Let me explain, can you listen?
So we can get right back to kissing

[Interlude]
So, we can get right back to kissing
But this life is so unforgiving (Unforgiving)
I'm missing you, missing you

[Verse 2]
I think I had forgotten what it feels like
To hold someone that you care about
I didn't want to pressure you into feelin'
Like we had to work things out
Got too drunk said some things that I shouldn't have (Oh)
I know I scared you off trust I understand (Oh)
Ask for another chance but I know I can't (Ooh)
Now here I am
Here I am (Ooh)
I'll be waiting here for you

But why you gotta create all this distance?

So we can get right back to kissingEmbed Why You Why You Sway Bleu chill
