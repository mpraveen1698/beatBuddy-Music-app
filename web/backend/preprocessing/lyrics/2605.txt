15 ContributorsCome On Get Higher Lyrics[Verse 1]
I miss the sound of your voice
And I miss the rush of your skin
And I miss the still of the silence
As you breathe out and I breathe in

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could walk on water
If I could tell you what's next
I'd make you believe
I'd make you forget

[Chorus]
So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love
So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

[Verse 2]
I miss the sound of your voice
The loudest thing in my head
And I ache to remember
All the violent, sweet
Perfect words that you said

If I could walk on water
If I could tell you what's next
I'd make you believe
I'd make you forget

[Chorus]
So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love
So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

[Verse 3]
I miss the pull of your heart
I taste the sparks on your tongue
I see angels and devils
And God, when you come on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Bridge]
Sing sha la la la
Sing sha la la la la
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love
So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me, drown me in love

[Outro]
(Come on, get higher, loosen my lips)
It's all wrong, it's all wrong (Faith and desire and the swing of your hips)
It's all wrong, it's so right
So come on, get higher
So come on and get higher
Cause everything works, love
Everything works in your arms6Embed Come On Get Higher Some Mad Hope Matt Nathanson acoustic
