47 ContributorsHardwired Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation, gone insane

[Chorus]
We're so fucked, shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Go

[Verse 2]
On the way to paranoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to the great destroyer, doomed design

[Chorus]
We're so fucked, shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Once upon a planet burning, once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning all in vain
Do you feel that hope is fading? Do you comprehend?
Do you feel it terminating in the end?
