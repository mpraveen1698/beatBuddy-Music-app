6 ContributorsShelf in the Room Lyrics[Intro]
The key is so distant
I've opened doors
Know when to listen
Know what to listen for, yeah

[Chorus]
The shelf in the room
Has been the way
Of holding me
And letting me stay

[Verse 2]
Kick me out
Let me go (go)
I don't belong here no more
A releasing sense
Of getting tired
Hold myself
I can't hold myself

[Chorus]
The shelf in the room
Has been the way
Of holding me
And letting me stay
The shelf in the room
Has been so true
I can hide
In the shelf in the room

Holding out (holding out)
Never hold in (never holding out)
Holding out (holding out, never hold)
Holding out (holding out)
Never hold in (never holding out)
Holding out (holding out, never hold)

[Verse 3]
Know when to listen
Know what to listen for
Believe in resistance
Don't let them tell you anymore
Is there anyway (no)
To get away? (no)
Ask myself
While I stay inside, yeah

[Chorus]
The shelf in the room
Has been the way
Of holding me
And letting me stay
The shelf in the room
Has been so true
I can hide
In the shelf in the room, yeah
[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Holding out (holding out)
Never hold in (never holding out)
Holding out (holding out, never hold)
Holding out (holding out)
Never hold in (never holding out)
Holding out (holding out, never hold)
(Holding out, never hold in)
(Holding out, never hold in)
Holding out, never hold
(Holding out, never hold in)
(Holding out, never hold in)
Holding out, never hold

[Outro]
The key is so distant
I've closed my doors
The shelf in the room
Is rain waiting to pourEmbed Shelf In The Room Days Of The New Days Of The New grunge
