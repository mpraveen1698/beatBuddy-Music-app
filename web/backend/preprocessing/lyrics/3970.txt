6 ContributorsNaan Lyrics[Verse 1: Molly Brazy]
You don't know naan bitch
That be fucking it up like Molly
Flex on a bitch, and have a nigga call me
Then play that pussy nigga for some dollars
I wrap the beef up like a quarter
Keep talking sideways, bitch I'm like, "Pardon me?"
Big Brazy, I do not do no arguing
She taking shots to the face like she partying
Yeah, you don't know naan bitch
That'll stack the money up and flip it
That'll buy more bottles than the niggas
Get a section for just me and my bitches
Make it rain on them strippers
Deep in that water like flippers
You know Molly getting richer
Hating hoes getting sicker
You don't know naan bitch, that woke up like this
Diamonds all over my wrist
Versace all over my hips
Gucci all on my kicks
Stand on the couches and turn up the view
Snuck in my pole just in case niggas trip
It's Brazy gang 'lil bitch!

[Chorus: Molly Brazy and Cuban Doll]
You don't know naan, bitch (uh, uh)
No, no, no
You don't know naan, bitch (uh, uh)
No, no
[x2]
You don't know naan bitch
That stay on her shit because she a boss
Keep pissing hating bitches off
She cannot lose, will not take a loss
You don't know naan, bitch (uh, uh)
No, no, no
You don't know naan, bitch (uh, uh)
No, no

You don't know naan bitch
That'll fuck up the rack like Cuban
I came through in Gucci, these hoes looking stupid
I came with some shooters, they probably gone do ya
You don't know naan, bitch
I don't argue or talk, or compete
'Cause these hoes be copy and pasting the Cuban
They copy the picture, like hoe, don't you do it
You don't know naan bitch
This really who I am bitch
Y'all just do it for the gram bitch, I need more bread than a sandwich
If a hoe hate, get my fan flip
Straight to the top like I planned it
I may go cop me a Lam, bitch
You finna know who I am, trick these little hoes
Don't know now bitch
I walk in a store, I don't look at the tag
I kill a fit, and I get to the bag
Molly and Cuban, two bitches who bad
You don't know nothing, you bitches too sad
Sum in the bag, that's my crew, get the love
I got more money than you, and your plug
I fuck up this money, I do what I want
Pussy water fall, don't need no scrub
[Verse 3: Molly Brazy]
