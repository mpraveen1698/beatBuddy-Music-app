Do you wanna? Yes or no
Do you wanna stay or do you wanna go?
If you do, then let me know
Do you wanna? Yes or no
Do you wanna stay? Do you wanna go?
If you do, then let me know
Do you wanna? Yes or no

[Verse 1]
Do you wanna? Yes or no
Been drinking from your potion
Baby, pass the lotion
Going thorough the motion
Drifting through your ocean
Got you on your side
Thumbing through your thighs

[Pre-Chorus]
What you wanna do?
Swear you always elude
Ain't no faultin' you, baby
I just want you to truce, baby
'Cause I know
You know, you want me
When life gets lonely, right?
What's your plan tonight?

Waiting for your get right
Touch me if you feel like
