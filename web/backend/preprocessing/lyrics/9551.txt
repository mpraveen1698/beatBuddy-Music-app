Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gotta live
I think you know the reason why

[Verse 1]
Sometimes the goin' gets so good
Then again it gets pretty rough
But when I have you in my arms, baby
You know I just can't, I just can't get enough, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Everybody's gotta live, yes, they do
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's tryin' to have a, a good time
I think you know the reason why

[Verse 2]
I saw a blind man standin' on a corner yesterday, baby
He couldn't hardly tie his shoes
But he had a harmonica and a guitar strapped around his neck
And he sure could, sure could play the blues, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Eveybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's tryin' to have a, a good time
I think you know the reason why
You might also like[Verse 3]
I feel like I've seen just about a million sunsets
She said, "If you're with me I'll never go away"
That's when I stopped, and I took another look at my baby
She said, "If you're with me I'll never go away, because"

[Chorus]
Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gotta live
Before you know the reason why

[Verse 4]
I had a dream the other night, baby
I dreamt that I was all alone
But when I woke up I took a look around my self
And I was surrounded by fifty million strong, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gotta live
Before you know the reason why, yeah

[Outro]
Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gotta live
You gotta live
Before you
Know the reason
