13 ContributorsWave of You Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Where am I supposed to be
Washed up, pushed out, or on my feet?
Tell me is this a dream
Or am I stuck in a movie scene?

[Pre-Chorus]
Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' away, so crazy
So, baby, just take me

[Chorus]
I think I'm caught up in the way I feel 'bout you
I don't know how I can be so drawn into you
I think I'm fallin' in deep
I think I'm caught up in a wave of you, of you, mm

[Verse 2]
Oh, upside down, I'm tip-toein' under the sea
Lost and found, I hide in the memory
Crossin' lines, am I gonna make it to the other side
Or do I have to chase it? (Oh)
Oh, I speak loud, but don't hear my voice
Ten feet down, does it feel like choice?
Hangin' onto the words you say
But еvery time I listen, I just hеar white noise
And all I see are these flashing lights
Can't hold on while they're passing by
How many wrongs does it take to right?
How many wrongs does it take to right?

I think I'm caught up in the way I feel 'bout you
I don't know how I can be so drawn into you
I think I'm fallin' in deep
I think I'm caught up in a wave of you, of you, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' around, so crazy
So, baby, just take me (Oh)
Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' around, so crazy
So, baby, just take me

[Chorus]
I think I'm caught up in the way I feel 'bout you
I don't know how I can be so drawn into you
I think I'm fallin' in deep
I think I'm caught up in a wave of you, of you, mm6Embed Wave of You Wave of You Surfaces soul
