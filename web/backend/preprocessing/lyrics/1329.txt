68 ContributorsPretty Fly (For a White Guy) Lyrics[Intro: Def Leppard]
Gunter glieben glauten globen

[Refrain: Chris Higgins, Nika Futterman & Heidi Villagran]
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

[Verse 1: Dexter Holland]
You know, it's kinda hard just to get along today
Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway
He may not have a clue and he may not have style
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial

[Chorus: Dexter Holland]
So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way, for you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing!

Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy

[Verse 2: Dexter Holland]
He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice
But they didn't have Ice Cube, so he bought Vanilla Ice
Now cruisin' in his Pinto, he sees homies as he pass
But if he looks twice, they're gonna kick his lily ass

[Chorus: Dexter Holland]
So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way, for you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world wants wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing!

[Verse 3: Dexter Holland]
Now he's gettin' a tattoo, yeah, he's gettin' ink done
He asked for a thirteen, but they drew a thirty-one
Friends say he's tryin' too hard and he's not quite hip
But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip
[Refrain: Chris Higgins, Nika Futterman & Heidi Villagran]
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

[Chorus: Dexter Holland]
So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way, for you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes, ah
The world loves wannabes, ah
Let's get some more wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing!16Embed Pretty Fly (For A White Guy) Americana The Offspring punk
