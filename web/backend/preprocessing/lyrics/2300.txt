19 ContributorsTouch Lyrics[Verse 1]
When will I feel this
As vivid as it truly is?
Fall in love in a single touch
And fall apart when it hurts too much
Can we skip past near-death clich√©s?
Where my heart restarts as my life replays

[Refrain]
All I want is to flip a switch
Before something breaks that cannot be fixed

[Chorus]
I know, I know, the sirens sound
Just before the walls come down
Pain's a well-intentioned weatherman
Predicting God as best he can
But, God, I wanna feel again

[Verse 2]
Rain or shine, I don't feel a thing
Just some information upon my skin
I miss the subtle aches
When the weather changed
The barometric pressure we always blamed
You might also like[Refrain]
All I want is to flip a switch
Before something breaks that cannot be fixed

[Bridge]
Invisible machinery
These moving parts inside of me
Well they've been shutting down for quite some time
Leaving only rust behind

[Chorus]
Well, I know, I know, the sirens sound
Just before the walls come down
Pain's a well-intentioned weatherman
Predicting God as best he can
But, God, I want to feel again
Oh, God, I want to feel again

[Outro]
Down my arms
A thousand satellites
Suddenly discover signs of life3Embed Touch Atlas: II Sleeping At Last ambient
