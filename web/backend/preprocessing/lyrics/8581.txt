1 ContributorDaily Duppy Lyrics(Part I)

[Intro]
(Steel Banglez)

[Chorus]
I ain't fuckin' wid no voodoo
When I took Shahad they did Wudhu
Hate me then killed my brudda Sidhu
Rest in peace to my Apna
While I'm alive Moose Wala, your names gonna live on
Karlas back, Karlas jatt
Harami Karla, yeah I'm tapped
Hit him with the wap
Knee deep in the streets
Really made me sleep with that wap
Really made me sleep with that wap

[Verse 1]
Crusin' round my old block, goin' spots where I've grown up
Catch a vibe, roll a cone up
The kid done blown up
Lonely at the top, I'm a loner
Birds eye view like the drones up
Let me own up, I'm far from perfect, I earnt this
Here to stay like I got a permit
Just touched 30, still got room for learning
I'm allergic to that vermin, leave a rat squirming
Silence til' the minute ends
It's been a while since my spirit cleansed
Built up pain, let me give it them
Famous, still dinner them
Nah I'm not inna dem
Mash man mode, move militant
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Its just a segment from this mad life
I blow smoke, Rastafari
I can't lie, I love life
I watched the yard for the whole night
Just to get my dough right
Drastic change for my own life

[Chorus]
I ain't fuckin' wid no voodoo
When I took Shahad they did Wudhu
Hate me then killed my brudda Sidhu
Rest in peace to my Apna
While I'm alive Moose Wala, your names gonna live on
Karlas back, Karlas jatt
Harami Karla, yeah I'm tapped
Hit him with the wap
Knee deep in the streets
Really made me sleep with that wap
Really made me sleep with that wap

[Verse 2]
I got premature pain
Moved out the way to get my head straight
Nice chess move, checkmate
Locked off the dead weight
Fuck what the feds say
Sickmade livin', comprende
Peace for the answer to my questions
I'm on a whole different spectrum
Yeah they wan' be around my section
Government forcin' injections
Fuck Sunak, fuck the feds and fuck the election
This a letter to my fans, now I'm back
My Apna's and Karla's and Akh's, I put you on the map
Spaz mode on a track
Had a load on my back I had to let go
How many miles on this ten toes
[Pre-Chorus]
Its just a segment from this mad life
I blow smoke, Rastafari
I can't lie, I love life
I watched the yard for the whole night
Just to get my dough right
Drastic change for my own life

[Chorus]
I ain't fuckin' wid no voodoo
When I took Shahad they did Wudhu
Hate me then killed my brudda Sidhu
Rest in peace to my Apna
While I'm alive Moose Wala, your names gonna live on
Karlas back, Karlas jatt
Harami Karla, yeah I'm tapped
Hit him with the wap
Knee deep in the streets
Really made me sleep with that wap
Really made me sleep with that wap

(Part II)

[Intro]
Came a long way from rock cookin', crack pushin'
If we go into the club we bringin' the woosh in
M-I-S to the fuckin' T
Apna's and Karla's business
Ahh, yeah, yeah
(Shadow on the beat)
[Chorus]
I ain't indulging in Doja Cat
But this spliffs full of Doja's fat
I'm in the club with this loaded strap
I get caught with this strap, it's a wrap
Let me not say too much cause' I'll be in the papers fast
I'll be in the papers fast, I said I'll be in the papers fast

[Verse]
No time for inspectors, Cosworth and Vectra's
Subaru's, Impreza's
Got bricks like Tetris
Tried to infect us, cut em off quick like sepsis
(A hunnid shots, a hunnid shots)
RIP Dolph in Memphis
Slimy, snakey man, they don't wanna hold their sentence
Flow was splendid
Act up, get ended
Trap out the blues, still trendin'
Debut album pendin'
How is it I got a mask on but still can't blend in
New waps and cash gave me a real incentive
Now I don't care, intensive
I'm in intensive care
Nuff man are talk but they ain't been there
Talk bout money when you ain't gone clear
Got custom Moncler
You must feel if you can't hear
Fake man, can't bare
Never been a calm breh
Get you in a sleep like a nightmare
With white boy guidance, creep in your yard in silence
On sight him then light him
Infrared beam, there's no need for the lighting
We ain't got swords like Vikings
Get caught with corn for your typing
The sound of the straps exciting
I know you can tell I've been writing
Back to ends, you went up north in NQ
I was in the crib freezin', shit got cold like a igloo
Change my approach, got a next view
Can't go old in the ends cause' the ends might end you
Games as a yute, Manhunt and Tenchu
Who's on the menu
Its fucked if we're in the venue
The movements appealing
But I got indecisive feelings
I really need healin', too much stealin' and dealin'
I said too much stealin' and dealin'

[Chorus]
I ain't indulging in Doja Cat
But this spliffs full of Doja's fat
I'm in the club with this loaded strap
I get caught with this strap, it's a wrap
Let me not say too much cause' I'll be in the papers fast
I'll be in the papers fast, I said I'll be in the papers fastEmbed Famous Famous Sidhu Moose Wala;Intense hip-hop
