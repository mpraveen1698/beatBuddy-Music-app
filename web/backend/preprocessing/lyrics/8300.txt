[Verse 1]
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In '65, I was seventeen and running up 101
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

[Chorus]
Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

[Verse 2]
Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In '69, I was twenty-one and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on

[Chorus]
Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind
You might also like[Bridge]
Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave

[Verse 3]
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes I see them running too

[Chorus]
Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

[Verse 4]
Honey, you really tempt me
You know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
(Running on)
You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
(Running blind)
Running into the sun but I'm running behind
[Outro]
