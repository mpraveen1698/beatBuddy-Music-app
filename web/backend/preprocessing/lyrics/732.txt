I remember the day
Even wrote down the date, that I fell for you (Mm-hmm)
And now it's crossed out in red
But I still can't forget if I wanted to
And it drives me insane
Think I'm hearin' your name, everywhere I go
But it's all in my head
It's just all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
But you won't see me break, call you up in three days
Or send you a bouquet, sayin', "It's a mistake"
Drink my troubles away, one more glass of champagne
And you know

[Chorus]
I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
And you're the first to say you want the best thing
But now I know a perfect way to let you go
Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
Here's your perfect

[Verse 2]
My best was just fine
How I tried, how I tried to be great for you
I'm flawed by design and you loved to remind me
No matter what I do
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But you won't see me break, call you up in three days
Or send you a bouquet, sayin', "It's a mistake"
Drink my troubles away, one more glass of champagne
And you know

[Chorus]
I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
And you're the first to say you want the best thing
But now I know a perfect way to let you go
Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
And you're the first to say you want the best thing (Best thing, yeah)
But now I know a perfect way to let you go
Give my last hello, hope it's worth it

[Outro]
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
But now I know a perfect way to let you go
Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
