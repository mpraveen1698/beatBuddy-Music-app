1 ContributorNever Too Late Lyrics[Alessandro Del Vecchio]
I thought I had to live in pain crying tears in the rain
Lonely without a friend to call and my happiness to rise and fall
I always dreamed of a life of joy
But sometimes love comes to destroy
I always wanted a life like in heaven
But I found myself in hell
But now that you are in my life
I found the strength to follow my heart
Never too late to fall in love
Never too late to rise again
I believe in you and I
I believe in love
You're my shelter from the storm
I'm your shoulder to cry upon
Here's the future in our hands
For us to believe in love again
Every night I hear your call
Is it you that grabs my soul?
Can't live without your hand in mine
That's the power of your love divine
I always fought for a path of life
I never looked for a last goodbye
Now I walk with you by my side
Our emotion will be our guide
I long for you touch
Like a flower needs the rainYou might also likeEmbed In Love Again In Love Again Lonely in the Rain french
