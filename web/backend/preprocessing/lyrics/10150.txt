5 ContributorsOn The Run Lyrics[Intro]
GeeHues, you did this one
Danny's got superpowers

[Chorus]
It's my life, in my eyes, I ain't do no wrong
Girl you lied, time and time, I'm so used to you
All this shit in my head, think I'm losing you
I'll be fine, but it's fine, I'll be alright
Life goes on and on, nights slow, I've been gone
Told 'em that I'm on the run
I run, I run
Ain't felt the same since you been gone
Hate the pain but I go on
She keep telling me I'm wrong
I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Yeah I ain't right, I told her I ain't lie
Time go past, I ain't high
They waiting for me they die but it's alright
Now more free time, timе
My bitch off white lines
Think I'm out my mind
Think I'm out my mind

[Verse]
I'm thinking of bettеr days
You said you can't stand my face
I'm gone and you're okay
Guess you gotta learn to love that way
Got a new watch, yeah plain jane
Got a new bitch, go both ways
I ain't stupid, I get paid
All this money bitch, I made a lot today
All these hundreds I'm thumbin', I'm thumbin', I'm thumbin'
Your bitch wanna come in, I fuck, now she cummin'
Bitch I got them running and running and ducking
Main bitch knocked at the door, say I'm coming, I'm coming
Niggas hate on the kid but it do not mean nothing
Brand new rollie and that bitch is flooded
Ice on my neck, little bitch that shit bussin'
I up that chop', now that nigga start fumblin'

Ain't felt the same since you been gone
Hate the pain but I go on
