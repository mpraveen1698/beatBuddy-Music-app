24 ContributorsSo Cold (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Crowded streets are cleared away
One by one
Hallowed heroes separate
As they run
You're so cold
Keep your hand in mine
Wise men wonder, while strong men die

[Chorus]
Show me how it ends, it's alright
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfy an empty inside
That's alright, let's give this another try

[Verse 2]
If you find your family
Don't you cry
In this land of make believe
Dead and dry
You're so cold, but you feel alive
Lay your hand on me, one last time

[Chorus]
Show me how it ends, it's alright
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfy an empty inside
That's alright, let's give this another try
Show me how it ends, it's all right
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well that's alright, let's give this another try
