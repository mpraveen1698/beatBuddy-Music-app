1 ContributorF My Ex Lyrics[Intro]
ZEL, this shit crazy

[Chorus]
Fuck my ex, I moved on
I worked hard, I proved wrong
Fuck love, I’m too young
Off the record, move on
Fuck my ex, I moved on
I worked hard, I proved wrong
Fuck love, I’m too young
Off the record, move on

[Verse 1]
Hopped on stage
Stepped with a few of the guys 25 like Christmas Day
Distant days, studio nights when i rap at 20 to 1 like Dave
All of the guys just chipped in ps for the Uber, the driver's using Waze
Ads on my phone while home alone, tryna scroll through posts
Tryna change my ways
What's broke cannot be fixed, I don't want you now, I'm young and lit
And I'm not in relationships 'cos I'm tryna gеt right, get mine, get rich!
Shе wanna FaceTime, start talking
Nah, wait, the bag keeps calling
I know you regret all the things that you did
Even your friends love to talk 'bout the kid
It's lit in the dunya, in the party
Couldn't care less if your bredrins came
Delete my number, matter of fact
Just keep it, but take that heart off my name
You’re tryna rekindle
Like Amazon Prime, you're tryna link up next day
You say that you miss me
But it's way too late, so I don't feel the same
You might also like[Chorus]
Fuck my ex, I moved on
I worked hard, I proved wrong
Fuck love, I’m too young
Off the record, move on
Fuck my ex, I moved on
I worked hard, I proved wrong
Fuck love, I’m too young
Off the record, move on

[Verse 2]
Fuck saying sorry to my ex, man I'm done, I'ma stick with this
I was too rough, back in the day, I'm on to the next like Little Mix
I did what I can, I gave you my word, but you never loaded the file
I cannot cater to you, sorry, I am not Destiny’s child
Always obsessing what I'm possessing, who that I link, it's not your concern
Always forgetting, you was offensive, never again, will you get a turn
You listen to Usher, made a confession, I'm tryna focus, I’ll let it burn
Fuck my ex's
It's time that she fixed right up and I hope that the lessons learned
It's lit in the dunya, in the party
Couldn't care less if your bredrins came
Delete my number, matter of fact
Just keep it, but take that heart off my name
You’re tryna rekindle
Like Amazon Prime, you're tryna link up next day
You say that you miss me
But it's way too late, so I don't feel the same
[Chorus]
Fuck my ex, I moved on
I worked hard, I proved wrong
Fuck love, I’m too young
Off the record, move on
Fuck my ex, I moved on
I worked hard, I proved wrong
Fuck love, I’m too young
Off the record, move on
Fuck my ex, I moved on
I worked hard, I proved wrong
Fuck love, I’m too young
Off the record, move on
Fuck my ex, I moved on
I worked hard, I proved wrong
Fuck love, I’m too young
Off the record, move onEmbed F My Ex F My Ex KAVO chill
