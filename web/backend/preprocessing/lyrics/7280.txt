7 ContributorsKiller Whale Lyrics[Verse 1: Ellen Ivy McGuirk, Scott Hermo, & Both]
Too soon
You're leaving when I just met you
I won't drift too far apart
I know it's hard, but I'll never let go
Just promise me you'll be here when I get back
I swear I'll be here when you get back home

[Verse 2: Scott Hermo & Ellen Ivy McGuirk]
Shark tooth
Now hanging 'round her neck since June
She's been slowly losing heart
He hopes and thinks she will not fold
I will be here waiting when you come back home

[Bridge: Ellen Ivy McGuirk]
Home, home
Home, home

[Outro: Scott Hermo]
I can't believe the stories
That I read when I was a boy
Yeah, they waited and waited forever
To be with the ones they lovedYou might also like1Embed Killer Whale Goose Bumps Boyscott garage
