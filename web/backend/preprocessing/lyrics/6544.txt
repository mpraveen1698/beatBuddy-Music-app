Oh, she is my girl
Oh, she loves to fight but

Oh, she is my girl
Oh, she loves to fight but
She's never been loved
She's never been loved

She's never been loved

She's never been loved
She's never been loved

Oh, she is my girl
Oh, she loves to fight but
She's never been loved
She's never been loved
