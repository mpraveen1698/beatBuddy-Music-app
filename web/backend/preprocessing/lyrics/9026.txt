Yeah, dear diary what a day that it's been
I thought about my life, I just don't know where to begin
Felt a lot of pain and strain it's hard not to sin
That's the sacrificies and prices you pay just to win
Yeah, see all this pressure man? It's building up
I feel the panic and doubt if I don't give enough
But what's enough, man? Because there ain't no written rule
I feel I'm on the brink of something, man, it's like a pinnacle
Yeah, feel like my past was a preparation
All them playground fights, they're gonna see their making
And all these late nights finally gonna see their waking
Ever wanted something so bad you just end up shaking?
Yeah, I swear down I put my life in this
So many night I cried just to try write like this
I felt my vibe had died, had to reignite the switch
I had to ride the vibe just to rewrite the script
And now I'm finally feeling like I've been resurrected
I spent too long trying to be somebody they expected
Don't chase anothers dream for your own to be neglected
Gotta believe to achieve, that's the best perspective
My whole life, man, my family's been tragedy
And it's a fallacy that everybody's mad at me
I'm paranoid and sometimes, yeah, I'm glad to be
Cuz' when somebody lets me down, at least I feel no blasphemy
And I always have the greatest intentions
Sometimes when I lie I'm in need of attention
I'm sorry that I missed your birthday
But I been in the studio making beats since last Thursday
How my brother man, he just had a kid
It's the greatest gift, they call me Uncle Big
But since her birth, man, I've only seen her twice
And it's trife, I swear down I'ma make it right, on my life
But this music, man, it's all that I'll ever be
And all this hate is a waste of my energy
I think it's time that I face all my enemies
I promise being honest is the base of the remedy
Yeah, and I swear to my mother, man I wish I was home, just like my sister and brother
And God knows the truth is I miss and I love her
Next time, man, I'm home I'ma kiss her and hug her

Dear Heath, first of all, know I'm listening, it feels so good to see you finally glistening
Twenty two years of hard work we been witnessing
It's too bad you missed your own neice's christening
And it goes without saying, I love your workrate
If there's a competition or race, you're first place
The difference between working hard and huslting is when you're huslting, man it's more than putting muscle in
And I know you're finding it hard with all your family
And deep down everybody has agony
But you keep it honest, all throughout the tragedy
And people look to you for faith cuz' you take it casually
But sometimes, man, you gotta know to let it rain
I feel your pain everyday when you write a page
And times change but I'll alway be the fucking same;
Your biggest fan everytime when you touch a stage
And you're the most honest rapper, undoubtedly
So I'ma shout into the clouds, into the mountain peaks
The whole world knows exactly what you're bound to be
So just believe, my G, cuz' you're about to see
And these kids need something to belive in, rappers these days ain't nothing but misleading
It's crazy to think of the thing you're finally achieving, five years ago, nobody was believing
But I know sometimes you find it hard to always take the stress
Satan only picks the strongest, thats what makes you best
Life's a test, I know it's hard to manifest, but try take it as a bless, and nothing less
So stay strong, my G, through all the fear and pain
A lot of rappers come and go but you're here to stay
I never hide but you know your face, clear as day
The real talk of mothers love never goes away1Embed Clear Day Clear Day Ima Rayner piano
