13 ContributorsTill It Hurts Lyrics[Intro: Bizzey]
Till, till, till it hu-hu-hurt
Till, till, till it hurt
Till, till, till it hu-hu-hurt
Till, till, till it hurt (Yep)

[Verse 1: Ayden]
Hold me tight, read my lips
Don’t need a word to say (Say, say, say)
Lay me down, blow my mind
Let’s take it all the way (Way, way, way)

[Pre-Chorus: Ayden]
Tell me will you love me tomorrow
Like you love me tonight? Oh-oh
See, we can worry about it tomorrow
Just give me tonight

[Chorus: Ayden]
Love me till it hurts
Make my body burn
Love me till it hurts
I need my heart to burst

[Drop: Bizzey]
(And bring on that bass)
Yellow motherfuckin' claw
You might also like[Verse 2: Bizzey]
If you want that real love, no fake love
That hard love until it hurts
That straight fire, no fake fight
We can’t stop until it hurts
Don’t you worry 'bout a thang
I’ma do you right
I’ma hit it in the morning
Like I do tonight

[Verse 3: Ayden]
Slow it down till my heart
Is ready to explode, -xplode, -xplode, -xplode
Bring it back, go down low
As far as you can go

[Pre-Chorus: Ayden]
Tell me will you love me tomorrow
Like you love me tonight? Oh-oh
So we can worry about it tomorrow
Just give me tonight

[Chorus: Ayden]
Love me till it hurts
Make my body burn
Love me till it hurts
I need my heart to burst
[Drop: Bizzey]
(And bring on that bass)
