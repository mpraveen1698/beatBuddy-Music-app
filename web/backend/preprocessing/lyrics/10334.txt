I hear the horns are calling, the fight is drawing nigh
Let them bring their thunder, and their puny battle cries
Forging an alliance with my courage and my steel
I am not afraid to die, and I will never kneel

[Verse 2]
I don't give a FIRE if I win or if I lose
Surviving is a cowards wish, and death is what I choose
My stamina depleted, but I am standing still
When the final blow will fall
I'm ready to be killed

[Pre-Chorus]
Behold
The sky is burning
Fight
For the sake of death
Brace
For your true ascension
This is the ride of the Valkyries

[Chorus]
We are warriors
The bravest in the lands
Chosen by the maidens
And united once again
Mighty warriors
We're the bravest in the lands
Chosen by the maidens
We're the kinsmen of the slain

I hear the horns are calling, I'm ready for the fight (fight)
Emptying the barrels before the fall of night
To prove that I am worthy before the Valkyries
I crack a skull, I pour four more
I'm on a drinking spree

[Breakout]
Are you ready for your destiny?!

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus]
Behold
The sky is burning
Fight
For the sake of death
Brace
For your true ascension
This is the ride of the Valkyries

[Chorus]
We are warriors
The bravest in the lands
Chosen by the maidens
And united once again
Mighty warriors
We're the bravest in the lands
Chosen by the maidens
We're the kinsmen of the slainEmbed Ride of the Valkyries Emblas Saga Brothers of Metal heavy-metal
