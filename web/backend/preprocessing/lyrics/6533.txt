1 ContributorShine LyricsWhen the fire’s low in December
When the rain strikes on the shutters
Give me hope in the darkness that I
Run and run in the summer like

Stop for a breath and come up for air
You know the finish line should still be there
Stop for a moment look up the sky
Chasing your dreams sometimes drives you mad

Someday it is in your hands
To put off this sad sad face
Maybe you can move on
Shine shine in the darkest places

Someday it is in your hands
To put off this sad sad facе
Maybe you can move on
Shine shinе in, Shine shine in
The darkest places

Shine shine in the darkest places
Shine shine in the darkest places

When the world blows off Remember
When the pain spikes face December
Give me hope in the starless night I
Run and run in the summer like
You might also likeStop for a minute do not be scared
I bet the finish line hasn’t moved he swears
Stop for a moment look up the sky
Chasing your dreams sometimes drives you mad

Someday it is in your hands
To put off this sad sad face
Maybe you can move on
Shine shine in the darkest places

Someday it is in your hands
To put off this sad sad face
Maybe you can move on
Shine shine in, Shine shine in
The darkest places

Shine shine in the darkest places
Shine shine in the darkest places
Shine shine in the darkest placesEmbed Shine Shine Broken Back french
