2 ContributorsYou Are My Sunshine Lyrics[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

[Verse]
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and I cried

[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

[Interlude]
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm

[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine awayYou might also likeEmbed You Are My Sunshine You Are My Sunshine Kina Grannis acoustic
