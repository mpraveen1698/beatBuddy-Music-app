I fell in love when I was sixteen
Met a nice girl, the feelings hit me
Didn't know much, I was too young then
She had a hard time at home and words were unsaid
I fell in love when I was sixteen
Met a nice girl, the feelings hit me
Didn't know much, I was too young then
Wish I helped you out, I could have held your hand

[Verse 1: Rxseboy]
Yeah, everybody told you to leave, get away, girl
Said I'm turning into the person you hate, girl
Started throwing fits, getting up in my face, girl
Then you threw a fist, it was more than a phase, girl
In a place you could never get out of
Inside, you were fighting the outcome
Lot of thoughts that I wish you could outrun
But it all caught up and you're now gone

[Bridge: Powfu]
Why'd you go? I'll hold your hand
Why'd you go? I'll hold your hand
Why'd you go? I'll hold your hand
Stay with me, why'd you leave?

Met a nice girl, the feelings hit me

I fell in love when I was sixteen
Met a nice girl, the feelings hit me

Damn

[Verse 2: Rxseboy]
I fell in love when I was sixteen
And we always talked about our big dreams
But next thing I knew, she's gone, I'm lonely
Yeah, she took her life to be with the old me
I'm sorry, girl, I'm sorry
Too much pain, getting drunk every party
I've been feeling off like a pause in my heartbeat
Girl, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry

[Verse 3: Powfu]
Ayy, yeah, sorry I'm a bag of shit
In front of my eyes, didn't read the script
I didn't get the hints, I didn't see your hurt
Now you up in Heaven and I'm stuck on Earth
I hate your mom for leaving you at home
Only you and your dad with his alcohol
Walk home from school, a new girl in your house
Drugs on the table and your dad on the couch
My girlfriend left and never left me clues
Didn't know this before, now I know from the news
I wish I had the power to go back in time
I would punch your dad and make sure you're fine
I would cut that rope and show you I care
Jeez, I miss your face and that cute green stare
When I close my eyes, I can see you there
In the empty room with a fallen chair

[Outro: Powfu]
Looking back, I was too young
No, I didn't understand
Wish that I could save you now
Ayy, sorry that I can't
I know I'm not to blame
But I know I could've helped
Maybe you wouldn't be gone
If I just asked you how you felt9Embed when we were 16 when we were 16 Rxseboy;Powfu;Mishaal sad
