Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
I think I started something
I got what I wanted, did-didn't I?
Can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z-Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice-cold lawn
She handed me a ice-blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley
At least you working
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking, anyway?
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste"
But can you taste, a little taste of…

[Chorus]
Novocaine, baby, baby
Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Verse 2]
Sink full of dishes, pacing in the kitchen
Cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod
Little red light on shootin'
I'm feelin' like Stanley Kubrick
This is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut
But it keeps on moving
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow, how-how
I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feeling I never had
Never had, never had (Never)
And ever since, I've been tryna get it back
And pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around
Quite like what I found in you, you
[Pre-Chorus]
I still can't feel my face
What am I smoking, anyway? (Ahh)
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste" (Ooh)
But can you taste, a little taste of…

[Chorus]
Novocaine, baby, baby (Ohh)
Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Bridge]
Novocaine, novocaine, novocaine
Novocaine, novocaine (Ohh)
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain
Numb the pain, numb the pain (Ohh, ohh)
Novocaine, novocaine, novocaine (Ohh)
Novocaine, novocaine (Ooh)
For the pain, for the pain (Ohh, ooh-huh)
Novocaine, novocaine
Ooh-huh, ooh-huh, ooh-huh
Ooh-huh, ooh-huh-huh-huh-huh
Ooh-huh, ooh-huh, ooh-huh
Ooh-huh, ooh-huh-huh-huh-huh
[Outro]
Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity (Ooh)
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, can't feel a thing
I can't feel a thing, can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
I can't feel, feel her
Novocaine, novocaine, novocaine
I can't feel, feel her
Novocaine for the pain, for the pain
I can't, can't feel her
Feel her, feel her, ohh
Novocaine, novocaine-caine225Embed Novacane Novacane Frank Ocean soul
