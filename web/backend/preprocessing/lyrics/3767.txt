[Intro]
I don't want to fuck you. You can't even sing
You have to sing or somethin', to get some pussy

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw (Yeah)
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw (This shit is bangin', that shit is bangin')

[Verse]
Shimmy, shimmy, ya, shimmy, yam, shimmy, yay
Give me the mic', so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon-voyage
Yeah, from the home of the Dodger Brooklyn squad
Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on your college-ass disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta go through one killer bee, and he aim for the kill
Now chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard quick, cement to the ground
For any emcee in any fifty-two states
I get psycho killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam, my flow is like "Bam"
Jump on stage and then I dip down (Yo, that shit is bangin')
(I like the way you talkin)
You might also like[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw, huh
