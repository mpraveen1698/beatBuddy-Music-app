My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
You better run
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
Ga-ga-ga-ga-ga

[Verse 1: Ryan Guldemond with Molly Guldemond and Debra-Jean Creelman]
It started with the hayloft a-creakin'
Well, it just started in the hay (loft)
With his long-johns on, Pop went a-creeping
Out to the barn, up to the hay
Young lovers and they are not sleeping
Young lovers in the hay (loft)
With his gun turned on, Pop went a-creeping
Out to the barn, up to the hay (loft)

[Chorus: Molly Guldemond and Debra-Jean Creelman]
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
You better run
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
Ga-ga-ga-ga-ga

[Verse 2: Ryan with Molly and Debra-Jean]
It started with the hayloft a-creakin'
Well, it just started in the hay
With his longjohns on, Pop went a-creeping
Out to the barn, up to the hay (loft)
Young lovers with their legs tied up in knots
Young lovers with their legs tied up in love
With his long, tall gun, Pop went a-creeping
To blow their hayloft bedheads straight off
[Chorus: Molly Guldemond and Debra-Jean Creelman]
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
You better run
My daddy's got a gun
