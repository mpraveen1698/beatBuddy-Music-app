74 ContributorsSelf Esteem Lyrics[Intro]
La, la, la-la-la
La, la, la-la-la

[Verse 1]
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know I'm being used
That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem

[Chorus]
Oh, way, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
We make plans to go out at night
I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light
This rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up, I just might tell her so

Oh, way, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah

[Verse 3]
Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem
[Chorus]
Oh, way, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah42Embed Self Esteem Smash The Offspring punk
