God stood me up
And I don't know why
Lights are on
But nobody's home

[Refrain]
There ain't no love like our love
There ain't no love like our love
Like our love, love, love, love, love

[Verse 2]
Let the lost ones go
And roll into night
Don't wake us up
We got nothing for you

[Refrain]
There ain't no love like our love
There ain't no love like our love
Like our love, love, love, love, love

[Verse 3]
Build us a dome
And rest here with me
Lights are on
But nobody's home

There ain't no love like our love
There ain't no love like our love1Embed Lights Are On Z-Sides Tom Rosenthal british
