Take me in the smoke
Breathe me in and let me go
Filling the lungs inside you
In the blackest night
Make my way into your mind
Just to know what you knew

[Chorus]
Restless every time
We start locking eyes
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Lost control
Oh, it’s paradise
With a nasty bite
Oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dead of the night

[Pre-Drop]
Let the darkness take control

[Drop]

[Post-Chorus]
Let the darkness take control
Darkness take control
May the darkness take control

Take me in the smoke
Breathe me in and let me go
Sink to your heart to find you
Open up your eyes
'Til you're blinded by the lies
So you can see what you do

[Chorus]
Restless every time
We start locking eyes
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Lost control
Oh, it’s paradise
With a nasty bite
Oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dead of the night

[Bridge]
Teardrops on the floor
The pain is over
Feel the darkness take control

[Drop]
May the darkness take control7Embed Control Control Unknown Brain;Jex;Rival edm
