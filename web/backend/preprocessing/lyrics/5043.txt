Riptide, it's a riptide
Riptide, it's a riptide

[Verse 1]
Finally frozen, no more emotion
Started escaping, now everything's numb
Dove in the deep end, stuck and I can't swim
So out of breath, I know I don't have long

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, this is way too much, just give me the rush
Yeah, this is way too much, just give me the rush

[Chorus]
I'm done explaining my pain, this is way too much
I wanna feel euphoria, give me the rush
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide that's trying to drown me
Full of excuses for way too long
Don't wanna sing another hopeless song
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide, it's a riptide

[Post-Chorus]
Riptide, it's a riptide
Riptide, it's a riptide

I'm so ashamed of my vicious problems
Keeping the worst of me all to myself
It's overwhelming, not ever telling
The ones I love that I gotta find help

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, this is way too much, just give me the rush
Yeah, this is way too much

[Chorus]
I'm done explaining my pain, this is way too much
I wanna feel euphoria, give me the rush
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide that's trying to drown me
Full of excuses for way too long
Don't wanna sing another hopeless song
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide, it's a riptide

[Breakdown]
Don't wanna die, I guess I gotta let it go
Don't wanna die, I guess I gotta let it go

[Bridge]
I'm done explaining my pain, this is way too much
I wanna feel euphoria, give me the rush
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide, yeah
[Chorus]
I'm done explaining my pain, this is way too much
I wanna feel euphoria, give me the rush
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide that's trying to drown me
Full of excuses for way too long
Don't wanna sing another hopeless song
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide, it's a riptide

[Outro]
Riptide, it's a riptide
Riptide, it's a riptide2Embed Riptide Riptide Beartooth metalcore
