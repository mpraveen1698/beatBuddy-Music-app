She never mentions the word "addiction"
In certain company
And, yes, she'll tell you she's an orphan
After you meet her family, yeah, alright
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Well, she paints her eyes as black as the night
And she pulls, she pulls those shades back down tight
Woah, there's a smile when the pain come
And it comes
The pain gonna make it alright
That's right

[Chorus]
Says she talks to the angels
She said that they call her out by her name
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Said that they call her out by her name

[Verse 3]
Well, she keeps a lock of hair in her pocket
She wears a cross around her neck
No, the hair is from a little boy, little boy
The cross from someone she has not met
Not yet
No, no, no, no

She talks to the angels
Said that they call her out by her name
Yeah, she talks to the angels
They call her out by her name

[Bridge]
She don't know no lover
None that I ever seen, Lord only knows
Oh, that don't mean nothin'
To me, it means
It means everything

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, she paints her eyes as black as the night
And she pulls, she pulls her shades back down tight
And, oh, baby, baby, there's a smile when the pain come
And you know it come
The pain gonna make it
Gonna make it all, make it all, all right

[Chorus]
Talks to, baby
Said that they call her out by her name
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, angels
Swear they call her out by her name
By her name, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
