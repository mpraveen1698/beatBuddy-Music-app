I'm a whisper lost upon wind
I'm the ember that will burn you down
I'm the water that will drown you
I'm a star that's just a black hole now
I'm a terrifying danger
I'm a fruit decaying on the ground
I'm a swallower of anger
I'm the tree that falls that makes no sound
I make no sound

[Chorus]
Cause if I stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up
Cause nobody gives a fuck
Stand up, break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me

[Verse 2]
I am fungus in the forest
I'm a lizard with a poisoned tongue
I'm the child in the manger
I'm the one who sacrificed his son
Rust is showing on my armor
I am wheezing like an old man done
I'm a product of my anger
I'm the bullet in a loaded gun

Stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up
Cause nobody gives a fuck
Stand up, break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me

[Chorus]
Cause if I stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up
Cause nobody gives a fuck
Stand up, break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me
(There's nobody praying for me)
There's nobody praying for me9Embed Nobody Praying For Me Isolate And Medicate Seether grunge
