4 ContributorsGrow As We Go (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Ben Platt, Ben Platt & Sara Bareilles]
You say there's so much you don't know
You need to go and find yourself
You say you'd rather be alone
'Cause you think you won't find it tied to someone else

[Pre-Chorus: Ben Platt & Sara Bareilles]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, who said it's true
That the growing only happens on your own?
They don't know me and you

[Chorus: Ben Platt & Sara Bareilles]
I don't think you have to leave
If to change is what you need
You can change right next to me
When you're high, I'll take the lows
You can ebb and I can flow
And we'll take it slow
And grow as we go (Go, ooh, ooh)
Grow as we go (Go, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Sara Bareilles]
You won't be the only one
I am unfinished, I've got so much left to learn
I don't know how this river runs
I'd like thе company through every twist and turn

Ooh, ooh, ooh, who said it's true
That thе growing only happens on your own?
They don't know me and you

[Chorus: Sara Bareilles, Ben Platt & Sara Bareilles]
You don't think ever have to leave
If to change is what you need
You can change right next to me
When you're high, I'll take the lows
You can ebb and I can flow
And we'll take it slow
And grow as we go
Grow as we go (Grow as we go)
Grow as we go (Grow as we go)
Grow as we go

[Bridge: Ben Platt & Sara Bareilles, Ben Platt, Sara Bareilles]
I don't know who we'll become (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I can't promise it's not written in the stars
But I believe that when it's done
We're gonna see that it was better
That we grew up together

[Chorus: Sara Bareilles, Ben Platt & Sara Bareilles]
Tell me you don't wanna leave
'Cause if change is what you need
You can change right next to me
When you're high, I'll take the lows
You can ebb and I can flow
We'll take it slow
And grow as we go
Grow as we go
Grow as we go (Grow as we go)
