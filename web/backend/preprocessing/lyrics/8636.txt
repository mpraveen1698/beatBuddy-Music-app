You and me, we have our demons
We both have our reasons
Maybe we should leave 'em
Why don't we just go
Grab our bags and put the key in
Start up all our dreamin'
We don't need permission

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's just hit the road
It's okay if we get lost
Driving nowhere in the dark
Find our way under the stars
Got a ticket in my hand
Living life without a plan
'Til we found Tomorrowland

[Chorus]
We're still young, wild and free
We make our own rules so just let us be
Let's be dumb, get things wrong
We won't say sorry when tomorrow comеs
Can't find yourself without the waves
Just gotta ridе them take 'em day by day
We don't take shit from anyone, 'cause we ain't done
We're still young

We're still young

[Verse 2]
We could fly out to Ibiza
Dance until our feet hurt
Make it our own secret
No one has to know
We could throw a party
Pass out on Bacardi
We don't need nobody
To tell us where to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Light a fire in the dark
You and I can be the spark
Find our way under the stars
Rise a red cup in your hand
Living life without a plan
'Til we found our wonderland

[Chorus]
We're still young, wild and free
We make our own rules so just let us be
We're still young, let's get dumb
We'll face tomorrow when the morning comes
Can't find yourself without the waves
Just gotta ride them take 'em day by day
We don't take shit from anyone, 'cause we ain't done
We're still young
[Drop]
We're still young
We're still young
