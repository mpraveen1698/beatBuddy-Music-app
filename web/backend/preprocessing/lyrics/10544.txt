4 ContributorsYou Feel Like Lyrics[Verse 1]
Deep in a fantasy right by your side
Wondering where you've been all my life
Feels like I made you up in my mind
But you're real and I'm reeling in all of these feelings

[Refrain]
I'm trying to find the words
But nothing ever works
How do I describe what's in front of my eyes?

[Verse 2]
This angel in my shirt
Makes me immature
But I don't mind it
I kinda like it

[Chorus]
'Cause you feel like summertime
Morning dew and midnight drives
I just wanna feel it with you
Like a glass of lemonade
Mercury in retrograde
I just wanna feel it with you (You, you, you)
I just wanna feel it with you
You might also like[Verse 3]
Freeze the moment, slow the motion, wanna take it in
Never knowing where we're going, only where we've been
Pull me closer, need a dose of you all on my skin
'Cause that's just how I'm feeling right now

[Refrain]
I'm trying to find the words
But nothing ever works
How do I describe what's in front of my eyes?

[Chorus]
'Cause you feel like summertime
Morning dew and midnight drives
I just wanna feel it with you
Like a glass of lemonade
Mercury in retrograde
I just wanna feel it with you (You, you, you)
I just wanna feel it with you

'Cause you feel like summertime
Morning dew and midnight drives
I just wanna feel it with you
Like a glass of lemonade
Mercury in retrograde
I just wanna feel it with you (You, you, you)
I just wanna feel it with you2Embed You Feel Like You Feel Like Hojean chill
