1 ContributorColleen Lyrics[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Ez Mil]
Dear Colleen, I don't know what's up
But you're not answerin'
I wish you could just open up to me
So we could just talk about stuff
And yes I wrote a song because I've ran out of ideas
To get you to notice me I'm tryna tell you somethin
Talk to me
Like what the fuck is happening?
Just tell me somethin, I'm begging you
I dropped my biggest cover and I wanted you
To be there to see it through
Your support is what I look forward to the most
But you're choosin' to post a selfie
To your feed instead of answerin me
Do you feel choked? or do you feel like
Everybody's drowning you?
Cuz this silent treatment you givin' people
Is fuckin' immature
You should act your age and tell me
If you are depressed
Tell me each and every problem
Get it off your fuckin' chest
You put me in a position in your life
That I deserve to know
Yes, I'm willin' to put all this for you
You fuckin' hoe
Tell me if there's someone else so my
Dad can say "I told you so"
I saw my whole future with you
But you're forcing me to let you go
You might also like[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Ez Mil]
Colleen I hope you know that
I'm really fuckin' serious
I don't know if there's somethin' that I did
Back in the past where you were in that Shining show
And I was worried to shit cuz
Of the stories that you told me
Of their frontman Niklas
Until it came to a point you were tellin' me
You were gonna leave the venue
Then you started sending fucked up
Messages of you typin' "jhelpsehsg"
Lost my shit I got Joseph to call detroit police
To attend you
Your replies stopped
And you don't know how that felt
It all passed, you replied, and you
Told me that you were fine
All sorts of comfort and relief
Came to my fucking mind
I told you this experience of fear
Was my first time
But it's like you disregardin' the
Fact that I was traumatized
Now I'm questionin' my fuckin self if you still
Care about me like I care for you
Hmm, lemme guess..
You fuckin' don't!
Cuz if you did you'd be givin' minutes and hours
To talk to me outta' your fuckin' day you fuckin' bitch!
What's a relationship without communication?
A mothafuckin' dead one!
You should be livin' up to your sayin'
That you told me that whenever you love
Someone, you give it your all!
You made my feelings reach this much
For you that's why I'm willin' to make this song
You not talkin' to me makes me feel like
Everything I do for us is fuckin' wrong
How fuckin' dare you drag me into
Your life and make me feel special
If you're the one who's letting
Us shatter and fuckin' fall!
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 3: Ez Mil]
Colleen I just wanna understand everything
That you feel
But you just ain't givin' me anything to hold on to
Your actions seem like you're choosin'
To ignore me and why is that?
Please just let me understand
Don't make me blame it on you
Is it these judgemental fucks who
Keep contacting you about Shining?
Or the depressive feeling you're getting
From grieving from your friends who passed away?
Who is making you feel that bad
And smothered that you're left with
Literally zero things to say?
It's makin' me thing that maybe the throat cancer
Of your dad got the good of him
This is what my over-thinkin' mind does
When it knows my heart hasn't had a speck
Of fuckin' attention from the essence of a
Person it's attached to
I apologize with all my soul for anything I
May have done to make you feel it's
Necessary to go non-existent
I'm genuine and blunt to you, so please be the same
Cuz to me this ain't a fucking game
I take absolutely everything about you
To my fucking heart and that's my imperfection
Are you still willin' to stick to me?
Cuz your mothafuckin' inconsistence just shows
That you don't love me enough
You ain't even missin' me!
Cuz unlike you Colleen
You're the person I wanna be talkin' to
Every single day, It's give and take
Where is the equality?
So please before I leave my country
If you are givin' us up just tell me
You don't love me so the pain dies peacefully
And you set me freeEmbed Hold on to Me Hold on to Me Furkan Sert deep-house
