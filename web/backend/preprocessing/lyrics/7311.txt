4 ContributorsDie Right Here Lyrics[Verse 1]
She was a stoner & I’m a good boy
A loner, but she’s a socialite
From Minnesota, sippin' on rum & soda
So sweet like Coca Cola, oh my

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t know what she sees in me
We’re opposites in ecstasy
So call me dumb or just lucky
But I forget to breathe, uh

[Chorus]
I feel like I could die right here
Kiss you on the neck & shed a single tear
No one would notice if we disappeared
Romantic hopeless, I could die right here
I could die right here

[Verse 2]
She looks like fireworks against a red sky
No words could ever do it justice
My favorite color is her skin in the summer
Like gold & coco butter, oh my

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don’t know what she sees in me
We’re opposites in ecstasy
So call me dumb or just lucky
But I forget to breathe, uh
You might also like[Chorus]
I feel like I could die right here
Kiss you on the neck & shed a single tear
No one would notice if we disappeared
Romantic hopeless, I could die right here
I could die right here

[Outro]
I feel like I could die right here, die right here
Like I could die right here, die right here
And shed a single tear, and disappear
Cause I could, I could die right hereEmbed Die Right Here Die Right Here david hugo indie-pop
