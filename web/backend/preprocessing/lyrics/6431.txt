Seen you from afar
Wondered who you are
Wondered what you're like
Think you're just my type

[Chorus]
And now I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you
And now I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you

[Verse 2]
Want you, yes, I do
Bet you never knew it
Think you'd suit me fine
Want you all the time

[Chorus]
And now I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you
And now I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you

[Bridge]
You're the one I'm calling on
You're the one who's calling me to have it
You're the one I'm calling on
You're the one who's calling me to have it
You're the one I'm calling on
You're the one who's calling me to have it
You're the one I'm calling on
You're the one who's calling me to have it
