It started with a kiss
On your mama's couch
2012 was nothing serious
And then we caught the feels
It got really real
Too good to be true
I guess I thought you was, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Why did I run away, run away, run away?
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

[Chorus]
I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, no, oh, cheating on you
Baby, no
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
You might also like[Verse 2]
Thought I could get you back any time of day
Shouldn't have been so cocky
Shouldn't have did you wrong (Woah)
And now I miss you bad, really, really bad
Guess you don't know what you got until it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Why did I run away, run away, run away? (Run away)
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything (Everything)
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late (Gettin' late)
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

[Chorus]
I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
(You said it too, baby)
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
(Cheating on you)
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new (Ooh)
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, no, oh, cheating on you
Baby, no
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
[Bridge]
Baby, no
There ain't no lips like your lips
And nobody else feels like this
There's no moving on, I'll admit
If you go away, yeah

[Chorus]
I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
(Cheating on you)
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
(Found someone new)
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
(Believe it, baby)

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, no, oh, cheating on you (I said goodbye, but I still feel like)
Baby, no (I said goodbye, but I still feel like)
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

[Outro]
I said goodbye
And you said goodbye21Embed Cheating on You Cheating on You Charlie Puth dance
