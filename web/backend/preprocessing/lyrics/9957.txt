2 ContributorsSnow (Hey Oh) LyricsCome to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone
Come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time

Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your hey oh
Now listen what I say, oh

When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on?
When it's killing me
When will I really see
All that I need to look inside

Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me
What do I really need
All that I need to look inside

Listen what I say, oh
I got your hey oh
Now listen what I say, oh

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, whoa, whoa

Hey oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your hey oh
Now listen what I say, ohEmbed Snow (Hey Oh) Snow (Hey Oh) Goldbird;Offmind deep-house
