Don’t leave my room for like a week, don't wanna go out
But all these moments keep me reminding me of just how
Just how you can’t have the high’s without the letdowns

I overcomplicate
I underestimate
How easy it is to live like this
Feel better if I take my time
Just a second and I’ll be alright
I know that there’s a love that's gonna find me

There’s something bout that feeling
There’s something bout that feeling
There’s something bout that feeling
There’s something bout that feeling

Outside the rain’s done dancing with the storm clouds
But inside there’s not a dry eye in this whole house
And it ain’t sadness why these tears keep falling down now
I know I’m not alone, I just get caught up in myself

I overcomplicate
And I underestimate
I know that there’s a love that's gonna find me
