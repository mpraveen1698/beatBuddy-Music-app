6 ContributorsWhy Don’t You Love Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Ryan Follese]
See, I can't wake up
I'm living a nightmare
That keeps playing over again
Locked in a room
So hung up on you
And you're cool with just being friends

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Follese]
Left on the sidelines
Stuck at a red light
Waiting for my time
And I can't see

[Chorus: Ryan Follese]
Why don't you love me?
Touch me
Tell me I'm your everything
The air you breathe
Why don't you love me, baby?
Open up your heart tonight
'Cause I could be all that you need, oh
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love me?

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
See, I'm just too scared
To tell you the truth
'Cause my heartache can't take anymore
Broken and bruised
Longing for you
And I don't know what I'm waiting for
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Left on the sidelines
Stuck at a red light
Waiting for my time
So just tell me

[Chorus: Ryan Follese & Demi Lovato]
Why don't you love me?
Touch me
Tell me I'm your everything
The air you breathe
And why don't you love me, baby?
Open up your heart tonight
'Cause I could be all that you need, oh

[Bridge: Demi Lovato & Ryan Follese]
Why don’t you give me a reason?
(Give me a reason)
Please tell me the truth
(Please tell me the truth)
You know that I’ll keep believing
(I’ll keep believing)
‘Til I’m with you

[Chorus: Ryan Follese & Demi Lovato]
Why don't you love me?
Kiss me
I can feel your heart tonight
It's killing me
So, why don't you love me?
Touch me
Tell me I'm your everything
The air you breathe
And why don't you love me, baby?
Open up your heart tonight
'Cause I could be all that you need, oh
[Outro: Ryan Follese & Demi Lovato]
