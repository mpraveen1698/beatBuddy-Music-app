I've been waiting for the tides to change
For the waves to send you my way
I see you, darling, but you pixelate
It gets hard to take these days

[Pre-Chorus]
But we’ll hold the line, I won't let go
'Cause I’ll be there when you can finally make it home
And I don't mind
'Cause we both know
That we'll be fine when you can finally make it home

[Chorus]
Because when I'm in a room with you
That missing piece is found
You know when you're by my side, darling
Nothing can bring us down

[Verse 2]
I remembеr happy wasted days
Summer's golden hazе in our eyes
Lifting you above the breaking waves
Memories floating back to my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
You said hold the line, I won't let go
’Cause I’ll be there when you can finally make it home
And I don't mind
’Cause we both know
That we'll be fine when you can finally make it home

Because when I'm in a room with you
That missing piece is found
You know when you're by my side, darling
Nothing can bring us down
It’s like when you're far away from me
I get lost in the crowd
Because when I'm in a room with you
That missing piece is found

[Bridge]
I won't waste a minute when you're here
And we're finally in the clear
When every day is like the last
I just keeping holding fast

[Chorus]
Because when I'm in a room with you
That missing piece is found
You know when you're by my side, darling
Nothing can bring us down
It's like when you're far away from me
I get lost in the crowd
Because when I'm in a room with you
That missing piece is found5Embed Missing Piece Missing Piece Vance Joy folk
