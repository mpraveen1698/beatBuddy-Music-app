Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Verse 1: Fred Rabe & Henning May]
I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway and before I even argue
He is looking out the window at somebody coming in

[Chorus: Fred Rabe & Henning May]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Verse 2: Henning May & Fred Rabe]
"It is always nice to see you", says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in, she is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way as they are kissing their hellos
And I'm pretending not to see them and instead I pour the milk

[Chorus: Fred Rabe & Henning May]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Bridge: Fred Rabe & Henning May]
Oh no, it is always nice to see you
It is always nice to see you
It is always nice to see you
It is always nice to see you
It is al-al-always nice
Al-al-always nice
It is always nice to see you
Always nice to see you
It is al-al-always nice
Oh, it is al-al-always nice

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Silence]

[Outro: Fred Rabe, Henning May & Both]
Oh, it is always nice to see you
Always nice!
It is always nice to see you
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
(Oh, it is always nice to see you)
(Always nice to see you)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo5Embed Tom's Diner Tom's Diner AnnenMayKantereit;Giant Rooks songwriter
