I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride

You've never met a motherfucker like me
Bet you've never seen the things that I've seen
Bottled up inside
This time I'm taking back my life
I'm rising up

Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
