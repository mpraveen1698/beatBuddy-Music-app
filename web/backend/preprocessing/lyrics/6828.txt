(Hahaha, aw man, it's gon' be a crazy summer)
(Ay Ross, sauce it up)

[Verse 1: JBrisko]
Big night, tell her now we ride
Forty pop your mana
Put that shit inside you
Purple hearts and roller-coasters, I remind you
Broken hearts all on the posters right beside you

[Refrain: JBrisko]
Slo mo, as in babys, slow it down for me
808s, heartbreaks, check the sound for me, woah
If that's your bih' then why she down for me
And why she pullin' up her top inside the crowd for me, woah
As in baby, slow it down for me
808s, heartbreaks, check the sound for me, woah
If that's your bih' then why she down for me
And why shе pullin' up her top inside the crowd for mе, woah

[Verse 2: JBrisko]
Slo mo, you know how it goes, so
I'm tryna go so gold
You just tryna go broke
You ain't never know till you on top like a GoPro
That petty shit's so-so
That's why we ride solo
Big whip, low-pro
Hot whip, phono
Does not mean "oh oh" so
I got string like yo-yo
I stack green and grow gold
That shit get high, ay
Bitch, I'm goin' live cuz
We do this all the time

Diss me, diss me

Okay, now sure to slow it down for me
She my little queen, bitch
So shorty hold the crowd for me
Ay, if that's your bih' then why she down for me
And why she pullin' up her top inside the crowd for me
