Lonely shadows following me
Lonely ghosts come calling
Lonely voices talking to me
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone, now I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And my mother told me son let it be
Sold my soul to the calling
Sold my soul to a sweet melody
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone, now I'm gone

[Chorus]
Lord gimme that fire
Lord gimme that fire
Lord gimme that fire
Burn, burn, burn

[Verse 2]
Oh, a thousand faces staring at me
Thousand times I've fallen
Thousand voices dead at my feet
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone, now I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And my mother told me son let it be
Sold my soul to the calling
Sold my soul to a sweet melody
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone, now I'm gone

Lord gimme that fire
Lord gimme that fire
Lord gimme that fire
Burn, burn, burn

[Bridge]
Ghosts and devils come calling
Calling my name out, lost in the fire
Sweet virgin blood is calling
Calling my name out, lost in the fire

[Chorus]
Lord gimme that fire
Lord gimme that fire
Lord gimme that fire
Burn, burn, burn
Lord gimme that fire
Lord gimme that fire
Lord gimme that fire
Burn, burn, burn10Embed Fire The Attractions Of Youth Barns Courtney alt-rock
