It's been a while
Oh, darlin', it's been a while
And nothing's changed
And nothing's changed
We're down the line
The same old feelings, down the line
And nothing's changed
And nothing's changed

[Verse 2]
And I still feel you over my skin
Now I need you again
Feel it in my blood
Nothing's changed
Yeah, nothing's changed
And I still feel you over my skin
Now I need you again
Feel it in my blood
Nothing's changed
No, never change

[Chorus]
Oh, you keep playin' on my heart
Keep playin' on my heartstrings
Yeah, you keep playin' on my heart
Keep playin' on my—
Oh, you keep playin' on my heart
Keep playin' on my heartstrings
Yeah, you keep playin' on my heart
Keep playin' on my—
