I didn't know there was a tower
Where they look out to the land
To see the people quickly passing by
This is for their own desire
As they spit down to the earth
To feel the power boiling in their veins

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah
Woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah!

[Chorus]
And the black smoke rises
From the fires, we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold

[Verse 2]
Many people are dividing
And a world apart with just one heart
Is bound to keel and fade away
None of us will be deciding
And the fate of man is in the hands
Of he who stands and heeds the call

[Chorus]
And the black smoke rises
From the fires, we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold

[Bridge]
Oh oh, woah-woah
Oh oh, woah-woah
(We won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold)
(We won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold)
Stand up in the cold
We won't stand, yeah!

[Chorus]
And the black smoke rises
From the fires, we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
And the black smoke rises
From the fires, we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold16Embed Black Smoke Rising From The Fires Greta Van Fleet blues
