2 ContributorsI see you Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me, babe, wanna leave this town?
I'm saying, lover, if you wanna go
I'm down!
Just tell me where we'll make it big and then
This place keeps killing our dream

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go, love
I'm sick and tired of waiting
We can leave this whole place behind, (yeah)
Let's go, love
I'm sick and tired of waiting
We can leave this whole place behind

[Verse 2]
Just tell me where we'll make it big and then
This place keeps killing our dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go, love
I'm sick and tired of waiting
We can leave this whole place behind, (yeah)
Let's go, love
I'm sick and tired of waiting
We can leave this whole place behindYou might also likeEmbed I See You I See You PLÃœM french
