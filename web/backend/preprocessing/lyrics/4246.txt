21 ContributorsEasy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Know it sounds funny, but I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me, girl, you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, that's why I'm easy (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
That's why I'm easy (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'm easy like Sunday morning

[Verse 2]
I wanna be high, so high
And I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free, just me, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, ooh, that's why I'm easy (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
That's why I'm easy, yeah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'm easy like Sunday morningYou might also like4Embed Easy Angel Dust (Deluxe Edition) Faith No More hard-rock
