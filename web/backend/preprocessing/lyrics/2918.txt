Next to Hudson Yards, it's crowded on the weekdays
From April to May
Parse apart a troubled heart from an e-train
And sing about it in LA

[Refrain]
With clouds in the rearview
You start humming along to the first verse
Of your favorite song that you quote each day
With the words all wrong

[Chorus]
So call me when the world looks bleak
I love you, but it’s hard to believe
With every day, we'll start to see
The rest is metamodernity

[Verse 2]
With agrestic charm, it's humid in the Midwest
From June to July
All beneath a pinkish sky from the wildfires
Which mantle the horizon line

[Refrain]
From the outset
It’s been hard to tell why we feel this down
When it all bodes well
You might also like[Chorus]
So call me when the world looks bleak
I love you, but it's hard to believe
With every day, we'll start to see
The rest is metamodernity7Embed Metamodernity Metamodernity Vansire indie
