25 ContributorsHouse of the Rising Sun Lyrics[Intro]
There is a house in Sin City
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And, God, I know I'm one

[Verse 1]
My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in Sin City

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now, the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

[Verse 3]
Well, I've got one foot on the platform
The other's on the train
I'm goin' back to Sin City
To wear that ball and chain

[Verse 4]
Well, others, tell your children
Never do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
In the House of the Rising Sun

[Outro]
Well, there's a house in Sin City
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God knows that I, I'm one11Embed House of The Rising Sun The Wrong Side Of Heaven And The Righteous Side Of Hell, Volume 2 Five Finger Death Punch groove
