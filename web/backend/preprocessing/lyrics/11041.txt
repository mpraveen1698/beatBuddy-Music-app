Driving through the outskirts of the town
Furrowed fields and cows
Lawn signs on the ground
I can't tell you where the end begins
But we’re as close as we've been
You smiled and shuffled in

[Chorus: Josh Augustin]
If I could then
I'd go back in time
All your friends and mine
Chasing evening light
’Cause lately I've been
Far more uninclined
To look you in the eye
And tell you we'll be fine

[Verse 2: FLOOR CRY]
Seasons change the world spins round and round
Never living in the now
Wе are lost and never found
I look back and smilе at memories
Even though you're here with me
I can't stop myself from mourning
You might also like[Chorus: FLOOR CRY]
I'd go back in time
All your friends and mine
Chasing evening light
'Cause lately I've been
Far more uninclined
To look you in the eye
And tell you we’ll be fine

[Outro: Josh Augustin]
If I could then
I’d go back in time
All your friends and mine
Chasing evening light
'Cause lately I’ve been
Far more uninclined
To look you in the eye
And tell you we'll be fineEmbed Evening Light The Modern Western World Vansire;FLOOR CRY indie-pop
