24 ContributorsWriting on the Walls Lyrics[Intro: Aaron Gillespie]
Maybe we, why don't we
Sit right here for half an hour?
We'll speak of what a waste I am
And how we missed your beat again

[Breakdown: Spencer Chamberlain]
I swear we need to find some comfort in this
Run down place
To bridge the gap of this conscious state that we live in
And I'm short on time

[Verse 1: Aaron Gillespie & Spencer Chamberlain]
How come you try? That brings us home
To fit the shape of,  and I pray for
What they tell you, you to move on, move on
But mostly what they show you

[Pre-Chorus: Aaron Gillespie & Spencer Chamberlain]
At this rate we can't keep up, I'm taking back all the things I've said
I'm taking back all the things I've said
But I sure can't just sit still
Keep me filled in, I swear I'll come

[Chorus: Spencer Chamberlain]
We walk alone, we walk alone
We walk alone, we walk alone
We walk alone, we walk alone
Back home, alone, back home

You're almost gone and I'm okay, I still see your shadow
To give you time to be afraid
But never your face
I still, I remember your presence

[Bridge: Aaron Gillespie & Spencer Chamberlain]
I hope to God you come down
I hope to God you feel this now
I hope to God you come down
I hope to God

[Outro: Spencer Chamberlain]
I know there must be some way out of here
And all of them will be waiting there5Embed Writing On The Walls Define The Great Line Underoath metalcore
