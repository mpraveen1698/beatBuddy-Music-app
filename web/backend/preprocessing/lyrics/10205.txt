This is a waltz
Thinking about our bodies
What they mean
For our salvation
With only the clothes
That we stand up in
Just the ground
On which we stand
Is the darkness
Ours to take?
Bathed in lightness
Bathed in heat

[Verse 2]
All is well
As long as we keep spinning
Here and now
Dancing behind a wall
Hear the old songs
And laughter within
All forgiven
Always and never been true

[Verse 3]
When I arrive
Will you come and find me?
Or in a crowd
Be one of them?
Mother wants us
Back beside her
No tomorrows
At peaceYou might also like18Embed Suspirium Suspiria (Music for the Luca Guadagnino Film) Thom Yorke electronic
