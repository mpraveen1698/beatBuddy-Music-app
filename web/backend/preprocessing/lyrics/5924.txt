8 ContributorsColors Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yesterday, I got lost in the circus
Feeling like such a mess
And now I'm down
I'm just hanging on the corner
I can't help but reminisce

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're gone
All the colors fade
When you're gone
No New Year's Day parade
You're gone
Colors seem to fade

[Verse 2]
Your mama called, she said
That you're downstairs crying
Feeling like such a mess
Yeah, I hear ya
In the background bawling
What happened to your sweet summer-time dress?

[Bridge]
I know we all
We all got our faults
We get locked in our vaults
And we stay

When you're gone
All the colors fade
When you're gone
No New Year's Day parade
You're gone
Colors seem to fade
