I wanna get over you
But I can't let go of your ghost
I wanna get over you
But I can't let go of your ghost

[Chorus]
Oh, it's time to get over you
And I gotta let go of your ghost
Oh, it's time to get over you
And I gotta let go of you
You go, go and I

But I can't let go of your ghost
I wanna forget that you were true that I need you the most
I wanna get over you
But I can't let go of your ghost
I wanna forget that you were true that I need you the most
I gotta let it go, let it go, let it go
Nah, nah, nah
Let it go, let it go, let it go
And I gotta
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Nah, nah, nah
Let it go, let it go, let it go
