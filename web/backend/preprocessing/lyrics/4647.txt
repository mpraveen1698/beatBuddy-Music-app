Bang
(Minimal, minimal, minimal, minimal
Minimal, minimal, minimal, minimal
Minimal, doo-doo-doo)

[Chorus]
Who in here tryna start a riot?
(Woo, let's start a riot, yeah)
Who in here tryna start a riot?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let’s go)
Who in here tryna start it?

[Verse 1]
Who that flyin' in the air? (Who?)
That ain't no flyin’ saucer (Ooh)
I'm shootin' webs like worldwide
Manhattan all the way to Yonkers (That's real)
When I say "Brooklyn, stand up" (Stand up)
You better just fix your posture
And every hero needs his theme song, so
Who in here tryna s-
You ain't got a chance, boy
What you think? (Huh?)
I thrown in everything but the kitchen sink (Yeah)
I try to be friendly in the neighborhood (Okay)
I know all the little grannies wanna sip they tea (Yeah)
And here you come, all bargin' in (Huh?)
All ugly like a brown fur cardigan
We can skip the monologue and the arguin'
I'm like
You might also like[Chorus]
Who in here tryna start a riot?
(Woo, let’s start a riot, yeah)
Who in here tryna start a riot?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let’s go)
Who in here tryna start it?

[Verse 2]
Let's rock ’n' roll (Rock)
So high up, I can see the flow
Down he go (Down)
It's a plane, it's a UFO
Friend or foe (What?)
Let me know
If you bump that action, it don’t matter
Just let me know-ow, know
Make way (Make way)
I'm comin' through with my crew to make 'em pay
I don't need no super suit, I'm feelin' brave
Don't be a hero, turn around and walk away (Way, way, way)

[Chorus]
Who in here tryna start a riot?
(Woo, let's start a riot, yeah)
Who in here tryna start a riot?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go)
Who in here tryna start it?
[Post-Chorus]
Start it up, start it right
Start it up, start it
Start it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Who in here tryna start it?

[Bridge]
Every day is like a sticky situation
When evil's lookin' for a chance (For a chance, ooh)
And I know we are the newest generation (Newest, newest)
We got the power in our hands
Web-slingin' through the trenches

[Refrain]
Make way
I'm comin' through with my crew to make 'em pay
I don't need no supersuit, I'm feelin' brave
When I say "Brooklyn, stand up" (Stand up)
You better just fix your posture
And every hero needs his theme song, so

Who in here tryna start a riot?
(Woo, let's start a riot, yeah)
Who in here tryna start a riot?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, bang
