5 ContributorsFaded Out (2022) Lyrics[Verse 1: Danny Worsnop]
I don't wanna wake up lately
The days are getting longer
It feels just like I'm going through the motions
And I don't know what's wrong with me
I wanna try, I wanna care
I wanna feel alive like I used to
I wanna be someone, do something
But it feels a little like sleepwalking

[Chorus: Danny Worsnop]
I'm faded out
I keep trying to stand, but I'm falling down
I'm stuck inside a loop, why can't I shake it off?
Is it not enough to wanna get better?
I'm faded out
And it's not getting better

[Verse 2: Sharon den Adel]
Give me something real to hold onto
'Cause I don't know what's real anymore
I'm walking through the haze tryin' to find you
The person that I was before
I gave it all, and I found a hole
That I didn't know was hiding
Thought I knew who I was, looks like I was wrong
And I've been out lost sleepwalking

I'm faded out
I keep trying to stand, but I'm falling down
I'm stuck inside a loop, why can't I shake it off?
Is it not enough to wanna get better?
I'm faded out (I lost myself once again)
And it's not getting better

[Bridge: Danny Worsnop]
I wanna find some peace of mind
I need a lifeline, please somebody, please somebody
I can't seem to wake up
Something's gotta give before I give up
I can't live like this
I hate everything I feel 'cause I don't feel anything anymore
And I don't know why
I just wanna stop time to catch my breath

[Chorus: Danny Worsnop & Sharon den Adel, Both]
I'm faded out (I lost myself once again)
I keep trying to stand, but I'm falling down (Falling down everything)
I'm stuck inside a loop, why can't I shake it off? (Shake it off)
Is it not enough (Is it not enough)
To wanna get better?
I'm faded out (I lost myself once again)
And it's not getting betterEmbed Faded Out (feat. Within Temptation) Faded Out (feat. Within Temptation) Asking Alexandria;Within Temptation metalcore
