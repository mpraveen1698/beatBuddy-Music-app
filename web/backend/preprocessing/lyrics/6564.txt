6 ContributorsTemptation Lyrics[Verse 1]
Keep on playin' games with my emotions
You don't know what you're doin' to me
Got this chemistry, I can't ignore it
So won't you be a secret I can keep?

[Pre-Chorus]
No, we can't fall into all these feelings 'cause
You know I'll lose myself when I'm with you
But when you get close, you know I can't pretend
This is somethin' we shouldn't do

[Chorus]
Temptation on my mind, in overdrive, it's all the time
That look within in your eyes, it drives me wild
And I can't take this
Temptation on my mind, in overdrive, it's all the time
That look within in your eyes, you drive me wild, oh

[Post-Chorus]
You'rе on my mind, it's all the time
You're on my mind, it's all thе time
Temptation
You're on my mind, it's all the time
Oh, temptation
You're on my mind, it's all the time

I'm confused and lookin' for an answer
I'm not sure where I want things to go (Things to go)
Feel this energy, I can't avoid it (No)
Keep it to myself, but I want you to know (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
No, we can't fall into all these feelings 'cause
You know I'll lose myself when I'm with you (I'ma lose myself)
But when you get close, you know I can't pretend
That this is somethin' we shouldn't do, oh

[Chorus]
Temptation on my mind, in overdrive, it's all the time
That look within in your eyes, it drives me wild
And I can't take this
Temptation on my mind, in overdrive, it's all the time
That look within in your eyes, you drive me wild, oh

[Post-Chorus]
You're on my mind, it's all the time (Temptation)
You're on my mind, it's all the time (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Temptation
You're on my mind, it's all the time (All the time)
Oh, temptation
You're on my mind, it's all the time (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Bridge]
Oh, this temptation
You know it, you know it now
You got me feelin' somethin' now

[Chorus]
Temptation on my mind, in overdrive, it's all the time (Oh)
That look within in your eyes, it drives me wild
And I can't take this
Temptation on my mind, in overdrive, it's all the time (On my mind)
That look within in your eyes, you drive me wild, oh

[Post-Chorus]
