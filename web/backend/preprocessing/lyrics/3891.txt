10 ContributorsLondon Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been three months since I saw you
Just a few texts here and there
I saw you're on a beach somewhere
I think I forgot to tell you
I found that list on my phone
Of places in London you wanted to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Those tourist shops around Camden Town
Take a late night ride on the Underground
See the gardens and drink warm beer
I know you would die if you knew I was here

[Chorus]
I feel so helpless and I feel so far away
If you knew where I was, I wonder what you'd say
I feel guilty and I don't know how to tell you
I saw London without you
I saw London without you

[Verse 2]
Everything here makes me miss you
I can picture us, still in love
Holding hands on a rooftop bus
I haven't posted any pictures
'Cause there's a part of me
That still believes I'll bring you back to
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
These tourist shops around Camden Town
Take a late night ride on the Underground (Ooh-ooh)
See the gardens and drink warm beer
I would give the world, God, I wish you were here

[Chorus]
I feel so helpless and I feel so far away
If you knew where I was, I wonder what you'd say
I feel guilty and I don't know how to tell you
I saw London without you
(I saw London without you, oh-oh-oh)
I saw London without you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh2Embed London London Mokita chill
