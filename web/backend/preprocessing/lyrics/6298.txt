J-J-Jayyeah

[Chorus]
Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts
Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts

[Bridge]
Love now, cry later, cry later
But, I always take the chance
But, I always take the chance
If I could save her
If I could save her
She said she got other plans, damn

[Chorus]
Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts
Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurtsYou might also like29Embed skyscrapers (love now, cry later) crybaby Lil Peep emo
