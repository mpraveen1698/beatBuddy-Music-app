1 ContributorAs You Are Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby, take my hand, let's runaway
Don't think about the world and let me show you
What you really mean to me
Hold me close to you, my baby
I wanna feel your lips on mine, so hold me tight
And never say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
There's something in you that makes me feel
That baby you're too good to be true, yeah
And I'm not perfect but I'll make it clear
I'll love you as you are but baby can you

[Chorus]
Take me as I am, I'll show you the way
I'll do anything for you and me
And I'll do everything, everything that I can
To make you feel the love you desеrve
You deservе all the love in this world, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
I've always seen my future in your eyes
There's always something 'bout you
And I don't know if you realize
I know you've hurt your heart, my baby
With someone you loved in the past
But you gotta know I'm here
And we'll make it last, make it last
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
There's something in you that makes me feel
That baby you're too good to be true (Ooh-ooh)
And I'm not perfect but I'll make it clear
Oh, that I'll love you as you are but baby can you

[Chorus]
Take me as I am (Take me as I am), I'll show you the way (No)
I'll do anything for you and me (Yeah, baby)
And I'll do everything, everything that I can (Ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah)
To make you feel the love you deserve (The love you deserve)
You deserve all the love in this world (Ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Deserve, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeahEmbed As You Are As You Are Zack Tabudlo acoustic
