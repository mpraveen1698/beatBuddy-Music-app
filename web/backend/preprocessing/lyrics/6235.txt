I'm the devil's son, straight out of hell
And you're an angel with a haunted heart
If you were smart, you'd run and protect yourself
From the demon living in the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing to be gained
'Cause I can never change
And you can never understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)

[Chorus]
Save yourself, from a life full of lies
And a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself, from the choices I make
'Cause nothing but failure follows me
(Save yourself, save yourself)

[Verse 2]
You're the perfect drug when it hurts like hell
I've never needed anyone so much
There's no one else I love, and I curse myself
'Cause the right thing is to give you up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm overcome by shame
'Cause I can never change
And you can never understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)
You might also like[Chorus]
Save yourself, from a life full of lies
And a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself, from the choices I make
'Cause nothing but failure follows-

Save yourself, from a life full of lies
And a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself, from the choices I make
'Cause nothing but failure follows me
(Save yourself, save yourself)

[Bridge]
You'll never understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)
'Cause I don't understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)

[Chorus]
Save yourself, from a life full of lies
And a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself, from the choices I make
'Cause nothing but failure follows-

Save yourself, from a life full of lies
And a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself, from the choices I make
'Cause nothing but failure follows me
(Save yourself, save yourself)9Embed Save Yourself Sick And Twisted Affair (Deluxe Edition) My Darkest Days metal
