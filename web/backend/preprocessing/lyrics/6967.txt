5 ContributorsLast Call LyricsDon't act like I'm not on your mind, you're on mine
I hope you're out somewhere right now and it's about that time
Someone's raising toast to someone they say they can't live without
Then I hope the bar kicks everybody out

'Cause when it's last call
I wanna be your first call
I wanna be your ride home
You're gonna be my downfall
I wanna be your Friday night at closing time
When loneliness and all the lights
Turn on, on, on
That's all I want

I hope that couple by the jukebox makes you smile
Has you thinking 'bout what it'd be likе if I was with you now
I'd tell you all of this but I don't wanna move too fast
And scare you off by tеlling you that

When it's last call
I wanna be your first call
I wanna be your ride home
You're gonna be my downfall
I wanna be your Friday night at closing time
When loneliness and all the lights
Turn on, on, on
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want, yeah

When loneliness and all the lights
(All the lights) Turn on, on, on
That's all I want

When it's last call
I wanna be your first call
I wanna be your ride home
You're gonna be my downfall
I wanna be your Friday night at closing time
When loneliness and all the lights
Turn on, on, on
That's all I want

That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want1Embed Last Call Last Call Jamie Miller soul
