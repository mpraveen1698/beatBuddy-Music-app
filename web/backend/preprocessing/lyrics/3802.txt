You can act all shy
But you know that I want you
In the dead of night
I want to live with you

[Chorus]
So terrified of the road that takes you
Me too
Don't modify, everyone adores you
At least I do

[Verse 2]
Right where the black wood sighs
I look at you, through and through
Right where your father died
I'll hold on to your hand

[Chorus]
So terrified of the road that takes you
Me too
Don't modify, everyone adores you
At least I do

[Outro]
Everybody has you up on their wall sometimes
Everybody thinks of you when they sleep at night
When I say, "Everybody," I'm actually referring to meYou might also like2Embed Everyone Adores You (at least I do) Good Morning It's Now Tomorrow Matt Maltese indie-pop
