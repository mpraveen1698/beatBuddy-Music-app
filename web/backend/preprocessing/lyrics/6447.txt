2 ContributorsGotta Give Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've said a thousand things before, but you know I never lied to you
You know I just can not beg you anymore, but I'm not ready to fall
We used to sit and talk for hours, yet you know you got the right to choose
Over time you'll see that now you've broken up with me, you've made the wrong call

[Pre-Chorus]
Should I have seen it coming? Out of nothing?
Were you running all along?
You gotta give me something, now you leave me on my own
Girl, you know it hurts me

[Chorus]
You gotta give me something baby, try to open up
Are you telling me it's pointless, are you telling mе to stop?
Ever since we'vе met, you made me feel alive
Now you make me survive, don't you break me
You gotta give me something baby, try to open up
Are you telling me it's pointless, are you telling me to stop?
Ever since we've met, you made me feel alive
Now you make me survive, don't you break me

[Verse 2]
Now you've left without a word, leave me guessing what is wrong with you
Was it me or something that I didn't do, that made you suddenly change
I find it hard to find the words, see me drowning here in solitude
Could it be that you have never really told me that we've turned the wrong page

Should I have seen it coming? Out of nothing?
Were you running all along?
You gotta give me something, now you leave me on my own
Girl, you know it hurts me

[Chorus]
You gotta give me something baby, try to open up
Are you telling me it's pointless, are you telling me to stop?
Ever since we met, you made me feel alive
Now you make me survive, don't you break me
You gotta give me something baby, try to open up
Are you telling me it's pointless, are you telling me to stop?
Ever since we've met, you made me feel alive
Now you make me survive, don't you break me
You gotta give me something baby, try to open up
Are you telling me it's pointless, are you telling me to stop?
Ever since we've met, you made me feel alive
Now you make me survive, don't you break meEmbed Gotta Give Me Gotta Give Me Saco;Sebastiën french
