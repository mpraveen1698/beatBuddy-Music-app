Brown skin and singing and dance (oh ho ho)
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can

This ain't nothing but a summer jam
Brown skin and singing and dance (oh ho ho)
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can

Hey ooh hey
Summer jam alright
Hey ooh hey

Tonight heart is wearing prouder skirts
Real tight temperature is rising
Feelin' real hot in the heat of the night

Midnight the party was stopped
Into the moonlight
I'm scoping out the honeys with the light eyes
Be with me tonight

Can't get you out of my mind
I can't lie
‘Cause a girl like you is so hard to find
I'm waiting for thе day to make you mine
‘Cause I can't takе it

Brown skin and singing and dance (oh ho ho)
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can

This ain't nothing but a summer jam
Brown skin and singing and dance (oh ho ho)
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we canEmbed Summer Jam Summer Jam New Times deep-house
