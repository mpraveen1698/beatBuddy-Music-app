Towards the sun
We always wonder
Why we love it
Why we love
Always on the run
Towards the sun
We always wonder
Why we love it
Why we love

Why we love

We can't bear it
Just to know that
Like the sun
Like the sun
Hey, we're in love
Baby, you know
If we don't do it
We'll regret it
Honestly, we've spent too much time waitin'

Why we love
Why we love
Why we love
Why we love
