1 ContributorAnother Love (Tiësto Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it’s so cold, and I don’t know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won’t flower like they did last spring

[Verse 2]
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I’m just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Drop]

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, anothеr love
All my tears have been usеd up
On another love, another love

[Verse 3]
I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it’s so cold, and I don’t know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won’t flower like they did last spring
