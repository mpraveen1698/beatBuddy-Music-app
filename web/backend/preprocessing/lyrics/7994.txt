3 ContributorsWant U Bad Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me just a little bit
I could be the one that's on your mind
And I know you want a little hit
Let me figure it out for you, I'm fine
If I wait for you, imagine it
Every time I make you feel alive
Your lonely hands on mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can be everything that you might need
I don't feel anything, back on my knees
Tell me you need me to be on your team
The prettiest woman that I've ever seen

[Chorus]
Girl, I really want you bad
Girl, I really want you bad
Girl, I really want you bad
Girl, I really want you bad

[Verse 2]
Take two
Girl, there ain't nobody else like you
And I know I wanna make you my boo, I do
I need you, I need you, baby
I do, I crave a woman like you
Ain't nobody else do it like you
Ain't nobody else do it like you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're pulling me closer
You're making this harder
When I touch on your body
Forget 'bout him slowly
You're making my heart light
Oh don't you tell, my girl
Our bodies are touching
But I know you still love him

[Chorus]
Girl, I really want you bad
Girl, I really want you bad
Girl, I really want you bad
Girl, I really want you bad

I can be everything that you might need
(Girl, I really want you)
I don't feel anything, back on my knees
(Girl, I really want you)
Tell me you need me to be on your team
(Girl, I really want you)
The prettiest woman that I've ever seen
(Girl, I really want you bad)Embed Want U Bad Want U Bad Fern. chill
