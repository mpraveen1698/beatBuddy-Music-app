29 ContributorsUntil the End Lyrics[Verse 1]
So clever
Whatever
I'm done with these endeavors
Alone, I walk the winding way
(Here I stay)
It's over
No longer
I feel it growing stronger
I live to die another day
Until I fade away
[Chorus]
Why give up?
Why give in?
It's not enough
It never is
So, I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough
It never is
But I will go on until the end

[Verse 2]
Surround me
It's easy
To fall apart completely
I feel you creeping up again
(In my head)
It's over
No longer
I feel it growing colder
I knew this day would come to end
So, let this life begin

Why give up?
Why give in?
It's not enough
It never is
So, I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough
It never is
But I will go on until the end

[Bridge]
I've lost my way
I've lost my way
But I will go on until the end

Living is
Hard enough
Without you fucking up

[Chorus]
Why give up?
Why give in?
It's not enough
It never is
So, I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough
It never is
But I will go on until the end
[Outro]
I've lost my way
I've lost my way
The final fight I'll win
The final fight I'll win
The final fight I'll win
But I will go on until the end14Embed Until The End Phobia (Explicit Version) Breaking Benjamin grunge
