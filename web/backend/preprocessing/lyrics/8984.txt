Everything has been said before
There's nothing left to say, anymore
When it's all the same
You can ask for it by name

[Pre-Chorus]
Babble babble, bitch bitch, rebel rebel, party party
Sex, sex, sex, and don't forget the "violence"
Blah, blah, blah, got your lovey-dovey sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in, everybody sing along
Babble babble, bitch bitch, rebel rebel, party party
Sex, sex, sex, and don't forget the "violence"
Blah, blah, blah, got your lovey-dovey sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in, everybody sing

[Chorus]
Are you motherfuckers ready for the new shit?
Stand up and admit tomorrow's never coming
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit
Do we get it? (No!)
Do we want it? (Yeah!)
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit
