16 ContributorsInnocence and Sadness Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never felt alone till the late night
Never knew she was my home till the tears dried
Workin' on the karma, but it takes time
Innocence and sadness was a fine line
Better savour every moment as it flies by
Every minute, boy, better live it, boy
Maybe someday you'll be happy for me, oh, I
Every minute, boy, steady rhythm joy

[Pre-Chorus]
The reason I stay
Wеll, I need you today
Baby, I would bleed in your name
I'm tryin' to be who you need me to bе

[Chorus]
I woulda waited for you all night to talk for a minute
I'll sing into the cold dark night till you listen
People spend their life heads down, souls hidden
I'm tryin' to be who you need me to be, well

[Verse 2]
Never felt alone till the late night
Never knew she was my home till the king cried
Lost inside the forest, but it feels fine
Innocence and sadness in the same night
All the love that just got stolen from your wide eyes
Every minute, boy, better live it, boy
Let your tears erode my shoulder like a cliff side
Heavy minutes, boy, steady rhythm joy
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
The reason I stay
Well, I need you today
Baby, I would bleed in your name
I'm tryin' to be who you need me to be

[Chorus]
I woulda waited for you all night to talk for a minute
I'll sing into the cold dark night, you listen
Some people spend their life heads down, souls hidden
I'm tryin' to be who you need me to be

[Bridge]
I'd do anything for smiles, I'd move Heaven and Earth
Nobody told me at the start how heaven can hurt
I'll be waitin' under streetlight at Bowery and 3rd
Know I was waitin' on ya, know I was waitin' on ya
Darlin', don't spend another second wonderin' what you're worth
Don't you ever get affected by the ways of this world
Wouldn't say my soul's protected, but there's somethin' at work
I was waitin' on ya, know I was waitin' on ya

[Outro]
Better savour every moment as it flies by
Every minute, boy, better live it, boy
Return me safely, turn me homeward at the right time
Every minute, boy, steady rhythm joy
Better savour every moment as it flies by
Every minute, boy, better live it, boy
Return me safely, turn me homeward at the right time
Heavy minutes, boy, steady rhythm joyEmbed Innocence and Sadness Songs of Sonder Dermot Kennedy folk
