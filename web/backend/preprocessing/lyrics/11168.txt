3 ContributorsThe First Time Free (Claptone Remix) LyricsFirst time I met House
It was a moonlit night
It was destined to be
It was love at first sight

First time I met House
I was lost in a space you see
I came here alone but
She made me feel right at home

First time I met House
She was deeper than deep
I felt a chill down my spine
From my head to my feet
First time I met House
I knew our love would last forever
Because
That night she blew my mind
It was a sign from the devine

First time I met House
I didn't know quite what to do
I’d wake up in a cold hot sweat
Wondering was it true?
Was my mind playing tricks on me?
Did my heart and my ears deceive?
Or was it just a lovely dream
I had one summer's eve?
First time I met House
I promised I'd leave her for no other
Even though I knew she had a million lovers, just like me
Embraced in her songs and melodies
Forever dictating my Saturday nights
And Sunday afternoons
I guess I’ll be her fool for as long as she wants me toYou might also likeEmbed The First Time Free - Claptone Remix The Masquerade (Mixed by Claptone) Ultra Naté;Roland Clark deep-house
