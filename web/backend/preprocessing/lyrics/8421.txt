1 ContributorBefore I Wake Up Lyrics[Intro]

[Hook]
And if I die
Before I wake up
I'll reach the sky
But some say that ain't much
Some say why
I say why not?
I feel so high
I never wanna wake up

[Verse 1]
In the studio, early mornings and late nights
Been in for a while, rarely seeing daylight
On the runway, homie 'bout to take flight
So far ahead of the rest, all they see is brake lights
Uh, high tides as the time flies
As the moon gravitates with the high tides
Through my high eyes glowing in the night sky
Regrets left in the past then kiss bye bye
Uh, I got a feeling within
I can't explain but I didn't really think it exist
Woke up, life changed with the flick of a switch
Perfect living, perfect living, mind a complete bliss
Haha, and there's nothing that can ruin it
On top of the world, I'm feeling cool as shit
When I wake I just hope I remember
I wish this would last me forever, but I gotta

Wake up!
Wake up!
Lets go!
Wake up!
You're late!
You're fuckin' late!
Wake the fuck up!

[Hook]
