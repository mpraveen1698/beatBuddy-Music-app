28 ContributorsParanoia Lyrics[Intro]
Go

[Verse 1]
Expect the worst of everyone I meet
Count the clock 'cause I can't fucking sleep
Shooting pain like a heart attack
Call my friends, I might not make it back

[Pre-Chorus]
The doctor says I'm headed for destruction
Something's gotta give

[Chorus]
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement
And no matter what you do 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm still in your head

[Verse 2]
It's got me scared, scared of the unknown
Unknown numbers been blowing up my phone
I'm hearing footsteps outside of my house
I'm afraid someone's trying to take me out

[Pre-Chorus]
The doctor says I'm headed for destruction
Can I fucking live?

I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm still in your head
I'm still in your head
I'm still in your head

[Breakdown]
I am your breaking point

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
You can't run, you can't hide
I'll be there when you close your eyes at night
I'm always watching you

[Pre-Chorus]
The doctor says I'm headed for destruction
My time is wearing thin

[Chorus]
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm still in your head
