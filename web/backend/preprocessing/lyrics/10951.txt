2 ContributorsThe Unknown Lyrics[Intro]
(Aaaaah Aaaah Uuuuuh Uuh)
(Aaaaah Aaaah Uuuuuh Uuh)

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like losing control
Can't recognize myself anymore
A stranger, caught in memories so long
It’s like my place to stay's been set in stone
I‘m chained to
This place by
A demon pulling far from the inside
Life's about to change, it’s not you, babe
I gotta shake the shackles when the day breaks

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the unknown
Been stayin' here for way too long
Let's go somewhere I belong
I'm in love with the unknown
Been stayin' here for way too long
It's okay to walk alone

[Verse 2]
I never asked for any of this
Jumping out the nest, take the risk?
Early morning skies give me goosebumps
They chasing routines keep their feet numb
I don't want
To look back
Remembering all the turns that we took yeah
Never quite the same, draw some new shapes
I gotta keep it moving for it’s too late
You might also like[Chorus]
I’m in love with the unknown
Been stayin' here for way too long
Let’s go somewhere I belong
I'm in love with the unknown
Been stayin' here for way too long
It's okay to walk alone

[Bridge]
Grass is greener, sun shines strong
Waves are breaking, turn to white wash
Magic mountains, endless roads
Flowing softly, silent stones
Don’t be sad, See you soon
I'm with you, listen closely
I might somehow end up home
Maybe I was just a dreamer

[Outro]
I'm in love with the unknown
(Aaaah Aaaah  Uuuuhh Aaaah)
I'm in love with the unknown
(Aaaah Aaaah  Uuuuhh Aaaah)1Embed The Unknown Cinematic Youth peach tinted chill
