13 ContributorsLet Go Lyrics[Chorus]
Tumble out of bed, dizzy in the head
Saying what you said, when you came home alone
Mumble a reply, followed by a lie
You've been wondering why, as if I've never known
Partial to the groove, but still you never move
Stubborn through and through, you're just an animal
Stuck inside your clutch, It's chilling to the touch
Never liked it much and now you won't let go (Let go, let go, let go)

[Post-Chorus]
(Back it, back it, back it, back it, back it) down

[Verse]
Admit that I was right, but still you try to fight
You leave me in the night, when you refuse to lose
Step out of the car, head into the bar
It's nothing new as far, as you're concerned
Wonder who to blame, your father was the same
Always playing games and never backing down
You stare at her face, wondering how to phrase
Your invitation home, you're just a little boy (Little boy, just a little boy)

[Refrain]
(Back it, back it, back it, back it, back it) down
You might also like[Chorus]
Tumble out of bed, dizzy in the head
Saying what you said, when you came home alone
Mumble a reply, followed by a lie
You've been wondering why, as if I've never known
Partial to the groove, but still you never move
Stubborn through and through, you're just an animal
Stuck inside your clutch, It's chilling to the touch
Never liked it much and now you won't let go (Let go, let go, let go)7Embed Let Go Let Go Ark Patrol;Veronika Redd soul
