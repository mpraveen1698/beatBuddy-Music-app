She's got that good-good vibes
Beauty that I can't describe
Golden like the summer skies (Summer skies)
Her shea butter skin don't crack
Brown sugar, she a chocolate snack
Fire gyal, she don't take no flack
You take the sun with you when you leave the room
It's incredible, I put you on a pedestal
I'm in awe, you're magical
You are special
You changed my life, it's a miracle
I'm in love, you already know

[Chorus: Adekunle Gold & NAO]
'Cause you're my, you're my antidote-dote
Dote-dote-dote-dote
You're my antidote-dote
'Cause you're my, you're my antidote-dote
Dote-dote-dote-dote
You're my antidote-dote
'Cause I'm in love, you already know, know

[Verse 2: NAO]
Baby, I love to have you
Take me from myself, you save me
You bring me life, you bring me joy
Lately, I've just been letting
Past life come and regress and take me
I pray for something more than just mystical
Ooh, you're something spiritual
Ooh, you made a miracle-cle
I pray for something more than metaphysical
Ooh, you're something spiritual
Will you be my antidote-dote?
