I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Found some faces that I don't know (I've been dreamin' about it)
Give me the sun for just a year
I'll kiss the sky and disappear

[Verse 1]
I've been starin' up at the greyest skies
Tryna find myself some luck but it's runnin' dry
It's like the weather makes the worst of my cloudy mind
I could really use a dose of some paradise
Sometimes you gotta run from a broken heart
Before I turn into a ghost, need a brand new start
Get myself headed to the coast, man, it ain't that far
Yeah, they got sun in L.A. and some shinin' stars

[Chorus]
I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Found some faces that I don't know (I've been dreamin' about it)
Seein' signs for California
Trade the shade for somethin' warmer
I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Where the people take it real slow (I've been dreamin' about it)
I need the sun for just a year
I'll kiss the sky and disappear

Ain't felt a drop now for forty days
But still they're washing cars and they don't show any age
Ain't nothin' that you want'll cost you more than time
If you're tryna find yourself, better get in line
I'm countin' up my money and spendin' to get it right
Got the future in my pocket, I'm spendin' it all tonight
Like a prophet with the vision, I finally see the light
And you know

[Chorus]
I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Found some faces that I don't know (I've been dreamin' about it)
Seein' signs for California
Trade the shade for somethin' warmer
I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Where the people take it real slow (I've been dreamin' about it)
I need the sun for just a year
I'll kiss the sky and disappear
(The West Coast)

[Bridge]
Glitter nights under starry skies
All I wanna do is fly
Take me where the sun shines bright, yeah
[Chorus]
I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast
Time to find myself a new glow
I need the sun for just a year
I'll kiss the sky and disappear
I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Found some faces that I don't know (I've been dreamin' about it)
Seein' signs for California
Trade the shade for somethin' warmer
I've been dreamin' 'bout the West Coast (I've been dreamin')
Where the people take it real slow (I've been dreamin' about it)
I need the sun for just a year
I'll kiss the sky and disappear6Embed West Coast West Coast OneRepublic piano
