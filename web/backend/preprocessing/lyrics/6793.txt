20 ContributorsTear Away Lyrics[Intro]
I'm tearing away
Pieces are falling
I can't seem to make them stay
You run away
Faster and faster
You can't seem to get away

Break!

[Verse 1]
Hope there's a reason
For questions unanswered
I just don't see everything
Yes, I'm inside you
Tell me, how does it feel
To feel like this just like I do?

[Chorus]
I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone
I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone

[Verse 2]
Do I really want this?
Sometimes, I scare myself
I just can't let it go
Can you believe it?
Everything happens for
Reasons I just don't know

I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone
I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone or anything but me

Goddamn, I love me

[Chorus]
I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone
I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone or anything

[Outro]
I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone3Embed Tear Away Sinner Drowning Pool grunge
