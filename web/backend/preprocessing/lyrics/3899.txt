Said I'd never fall, I'd never fall, I'd never fall
But then I fell for you, mmm
Back against the wall, against the wall, against the wall
That's how it felt with you, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
One weekend in Portland
You weren't even my girlfriend
We were walking and talking
Then somebody said let's get

[Chorus]
Tattoos together, something to remember
If it's way too soon, fuck it, whatever
Give me shapes and letters, if it's not forever
Then at least we'll have tattoos together

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, 'cause I love you
Mmm, 'cause I love you
Mmm, 'cause I love you
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
Knew it from the moment, from the moment
From the moment that I saw you naked, mmm, yeah
I could never love nobody else, nobody else
The way I loved you baby, mmm, mmm

I've been hoping, praying we last forever
'Cause there's nothing better than you and I
