8 ContributorsRoll Dem Bones Lyrics[Intro]
This will be the last tear I shed for you

[Verse 1]
Some say they kill for God
And some kill for sport
The only difference makes no difference to me
It just depends on what looks better in court
'Cause it's a knock-down, drag-out
"Everybody bow down"
Sick and twisted game that you play
There are no resolutions
In the broken institutions
Or the funny bloody money you crave

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the last tear
This is the last time

[Chorus]
There was a time that I believed
I could've changed it all
Somebody got to me
Somebody's got to pay
There was a time that I believed
I could've changed the world
Now I can't, now I don't, now I won't
So, roll dem bones

Puff your chest out at me
Just what the fuck were you thinking?
I wrote the book on that shit
Bound it, backed it, burned it all down
I'm a bully-beating reaper
Cheating supervillain, king of heathens
Everything you know that you're not
You're like a half-wit parlor trick
No one ever gave a shit
I'm laughing on the day that you drop

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the last tear
This is the last time

[Chorus]
There was a time that I believed
I could've changed it all
Somebody got to me
Somebody's got to pay
There was a time that I believed
I could've changed the world
Now I can't, now I don't, now I won't
So, roll dem bones
[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the last tear
This is the last time

[Chorus]
There was a time that I believed
I could've changed it all
Somebody got to me
Somebody's got to pay
There was a time that I believed
I could've changed the world
Now I can't, now I don't, now I won't
So, roll dem bones
