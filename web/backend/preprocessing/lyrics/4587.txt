It's Bizzouch

[Chorus]
Girl, don't flex with the boy, your body is a mad ting
She wanna roll with the mandem
When I drop, you know it's an anthem
Oof, girlie wanna play with a big playboy like me
Oof, girlie wanna play with a big playboy like me
Oof, girl, don't flex with the boy, your body is a mad ting
She wanna roll with the mandem
When I drop, you know it's an anthem
Ah, ah, girlie wanna play with a big playboy like me
Ah, girlie wanna play with a big playboy like me

[Verse 1]
Pull up in the club with all my Gs
When we outside, it's an all night thing
Gyaldem start to shake when they call my name
Don't play with a boy like me
Who you else know live a life like this?
LA to Houston to NYC
I'm always on thе road, emi omo oro
Don't play with a guy like this
I like shayo, I no likе gbana
One Hennessy for my corner
Gimme some more, gimme some jara
So many hoes them a think I'm a farmer
I like shayo, I no like gbana
One Hennessy for my corner
Gimme some more, gimme some jara
So many hoes them a think I'm a farmer
Yeah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Do you wanna play that?
Two bad girls in a Maybach
And I've got more on my radar
So all my mandem pull up in a black Bentayga
Guantanamera
Been a bad boy since way back
Girl, I'ma see you later
And I know you're in love with me, but please don't say that
Don dada, godfather, none badder
Nonchalant, unbothered, all of dat
Make nobody dull my parole
Make nobody follow my shadow
Bring more cups, let Hennessy flow
Sweet white wine and anything goes
Even all my friends, all my enemies know
There's never been a time where my energy low
Yeah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
Girl, don't flex with the boy, your body is a mad ting (Mad ting)
She wanna roll with the mandem
When I drop, you know it's an anthem
Oof, girlie wanna play with a big playboy like me (Playboy like me)
Oof, girlie wanna play with a big playboy like me (Playboy like me)
Oof, girl, don't flex with the boy, your body is a mad ting (Mad ting)
She wanna roll with the mandem
When I drop, you know it's an anthem
Ah, ah, girlie wanna play with a big playboy like me (Playboy like me)
Ah, girlie wanna play with a big playboy like me (Playboy like me)

[Outro]
