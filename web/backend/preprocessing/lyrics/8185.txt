2 ContributorsLost My Heartbreak Lyrics[Verse 1]
I lost my world today
And guess forever had an end
Pulled out the driveway
It ain't coming back again
So I called up my friends
Get out of this town
And get into some unknown
We passed every sign, crossed every line
Next thing you know

[Chorus]
I met a girl and got lost in her smile
And that kiss from her lips
Damn, she was on fire
Like the sunset in her eyes
And when she looked back into mine
Yeah, you found me the reason why
I lost my heartbreak

[Verse 2]
I lost my world today
Bet you would've lost yours too
It changed everything
When I saw that pretty face
Then you grabbed my hand
Snuck out of the back to spy with just you and me
We passed every sign, crossed every line
Felt so good to be free
You might also like[Chorus]
I met a girl and got lost in her smile
And that kiss from her lips
Damn, she was on fire
Like the sunset in her eyes
And when she looked back into mine
Yeah, you found me the reason why
I lost my heartbreak

[Bridge]
I lost my heartbreak
I lost my mistake
I lost everything that was on my mind when

[Chorus]
I met a girl and got lost in her smile
And that kiss from her lips
Damn, she was on fire
Like the sunset in her eyes
And when she looked back into mine
Yeah, you found me the reason why
I lost my heartbreak
I lost my mistake
I lost everything that was on my mind when

[Outro]
I lost my world today
Yeah, you changed everythingEmbed Lost My Heartbreak Lost My Heartbreak David J country
