13 ContributorsUnder the Knife Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wake me up inside
Tell me there's a reason
To take another step
To get up off my knees and
Follow this path of most resistance
And wherever it takes us
Whatever it faces and wherever it leads

[Chorus]
So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside

[Verse 2]
Something for the pain, just to kill this feeling
Although we look awake, inside we're all still sleeping
I've spent my time here alive, but barely there
Do you believe we'll ever make it?
Do you think we'll ever really see?

[Chorus]
So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside

Wake me up inside
These dreams all die if we let them
Wake me up inside
Today won't start if we just give in
(Cause you'll be anything)

[Outro]
Just wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside1Embed Under The Knife The Sufferer & The Witness Rise Against hardcore
