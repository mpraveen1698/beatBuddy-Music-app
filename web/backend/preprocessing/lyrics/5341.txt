Fuck love, too many reasons
Now I’m all alone
Take my heart, I think you need it
Hate the way you lie
Why you change up like the seasons?
Tell my mom I’m sorry, I’m too weak to bear these feelings (So, now it’s)
Fuck love, nobody could fix you
I know it's my own fault, hate the way I miss you
I could never trust after everything I’ve been through
I just wanna feel alive like the way I used to

[Verse 1]
Feel you underneath my skin like a tattoo
Can’t forget all of the memories that I have with you
Visit you inside my dreams, I’ll be back soon
Keep me out thе present, what the past do?
And ain’t no drug could fix mе, I’m too fucked up
But that’s what all the lies and broken trust does
I can’t even think without you on my mind
Even though I’m breathing I don’t feel alive
Tell me how it feels to have a heart so cold
Without you in my arms I have no one to hold
Now I know that everything that glitters ain’t gold
Broken into pieces, I could never be whole
You might also like[Chorus]
Fuck love, too many reasons
Now I’m all alone
Take my heart, I think you need it
Hate the way you lie
Why you change up like the seasons?
Tell my mom I’m sorry, I’m too weak to bear these feelings (So, now it’s)
Fuck love, nobody could fix you
I know it's my own fault, hate the way I miss you
I could never trust after everything I’ve been through
I just wanna feel alive like the way I used to

[Verse 2]
Feel a death rattle, think I’m turning into a ghost
Thinking I could end this pain with just one note
What will they remember if I don’t make it to morning?
Should I tell you how I feel if it won’t matter anymore?
Looking in the mirror, don’t know who I see, it isn’t me
I don’t want to feel, wake me up and tell me it’s a dream
I could never be anything that you wanted from me
Thought I had your heart, but everything ain’t always what it seems
Devil in disguise, every promise made, didn’t keep
Played me for a fool, stab me in the back to watch me bleed
Look me in my eyes and tell me that you didn’t feel a thing
Gave my heart to you, didn’t know it’d be the end of me
Didn’t know, didn’t know, but I know now
Wish I would've knew you’d turn our love into a war
How’d you learn to be so cruel and tear the heart right off my sleeve?
Girl, I gave you all my love, how could you do this to me?
[Chorus]
Fuck love, too many reasons
Now I’m all alone
Take my heart, I think you need it
Hate the way you lie
Why you change up like the seasons?
Tell my mom I’m sorry, I’m too weak to bear these feelings (So, now it’s)
Fuck love, nobody could fix you
I know it's my own fault, hate the way I miss you
I could never trust after everything I’ve been through
I just wanna feel alive like the way I used to6Embed F*ck Love F*ck Love Lund sad
