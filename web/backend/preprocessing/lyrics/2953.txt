So slowly a sunlit dream pulls me out of sleep
Feel the morning through the blinds
I get to thinking 'bout your sunkissed face
And a quiet place I could give you all my time

[Verse 1]
You know I wanna be your rock, my love
You know I wanna be your light
In darkness how you find me just in time
To tell me what I needed to hear
So if you don't know what you need
You can leave it all to me
Don't want you worried about a thing
I know you'd do the same for me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're so lovely
You're so lovely
I can't help but fall for you‚ love
When you love me
It's so lovely loving you
Oh-oh‚ oh-oh
So lovely loving you
Oh-oh‚ oh-oh

So softly a tender breeze brush against my knees on a summer afternoon
I get to thinking 'bout the hazy days
Under August shade that I used to spend with you
I didn't realize it was all I wanted, what I had
My riddled heart I had to cradle back together just to see
It's all like magic to me
You do magic, baby

[Chorus]
When you love me
You're so lovely
I can't help but fall for you‚ love
When you love me
It's so lovely loving you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
So lovely loving you
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
So slowly a sunlit dream pulls me out of sleep
Feel the morning through the blinds
I turn my head to meet your sunkissed face
In this quiet place I can give you all my time19Embed Sunkissed Now and Then khai dreams indie-pop
