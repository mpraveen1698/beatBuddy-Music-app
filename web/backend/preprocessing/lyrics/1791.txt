8 ContributorsAlone With You Lyrics[Intro]
I want to be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I want to steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
(Ay yo, Pluto, you goin' brazy)
I don't know what to do
To deal with your kiss on my neck

[Verse 1]
I ain't never had a girl like this, real to the core, it's real
And I can't talk 'bout sex every day on the track
So I talk 'bout the shit I feel
I might give you flowers and kisses, not just dick, and this shit's real
I might pull up on a late-night one
Like slap on a movie and come, let's chill
I remember the day that I met you, no way could I evеr forget that
I would go back home in the DLR train, just missin' thе fact you left, man
I'm textin' bro like, "Yo"
E man text me back like, "Wah gwan?"
I said, "Bro, after all the hoe stages I'm ready, I found the one"
Fake accounts gonna talk their shit, why? Both of us be lit
And I don't really give a fuck 'bout that, as long as our relationship is bliss
And I know that my baby humble, but I know that your temper's short
And I know that I hurt you one time, if I do that again then I'm a fool
And I know that the love runs deep, trust me, you know I know
And I know that you really do got me, trust me, I know, I know
Wintertime is cold, it's cold, and I find it hard to express
So I'm writin' this shit on notes, I just put my feelings into the music
That's the way that man know

(I want to steal your soul)
I wanna steal your soul now, what
I wanna steal your soul
(And hide you in my treasure chest)
I'ma hide you, huh, trust me, they can't find you
(I don't know what to do)
And I don't know what to do now, nah, but I don't know what to do
(To deal with your kiss on my neck)
Mmm
Hold on, let me talk star signs, hear what I'm sayin'

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, I'm glad that I got me a Pisces
With water, you put me out and I keep you grounded
That's light, B, I'm so glad that your mum do like me
Got the old school love like '90s
And god forbid, if I ever go jail, then I know that my babe will write me
And I know that its ya b-day soon, I got you and you on your b-day, boo
I know when you're upset, trust me, man I see straight through
We're havin' a minor dispute, you walk out the room, man that shit's so rude
But you know that we're stuck like glue, 4L 'cause the girl my boo, Arz

[Outro]
I don't know what to do
To deal with your kiss on my neck
I want to be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I want to steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To deal with your kiss on my neckEmbed Alone With You Alone With You Arz chill
