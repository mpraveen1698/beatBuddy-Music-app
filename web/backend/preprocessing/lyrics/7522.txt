I never found it, until I stopped trying
I stumbled upon you, and fell through the ceiling tiles

I started a fire to smoke out my treasons
I tore down a building to pick up the pieces
And now on a clear glass wall, I can see our fate
But it’s a little too late

Oh, if you’re hearing this
I must have made it through
Oh, when the clouds above open up through my window
I’ll see the sky’s still blue

You never hold onto what we believe in
I think I've lost you, tell me I'm dreaming
Why do we wait to live till we begin to die?

I made the incision, I begged and I borrowed
I traded my vision for heartache and sorrow
But now that I’ve found my sight
I finally realize I was born to go blind

Oh, if you’re hearing this
I must have made it through
Oh, when the clouds above open up through my window
I’ll see the sky’s still blue
