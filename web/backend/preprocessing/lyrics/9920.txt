19 ContributorsTaste of You Lyrics[Intro]
Woo, yeah

[Verse 1]
We started buzzing
Blood was rushin', but it wasn't only to my head
To my head (To my head)
You make me weaker, you're my keeper
Pull me deeper, take me to the edge
And I jump in (I jump in)

[Pre-Chorus]
All wrongs do me right, I dig my nails in dynamite
I might go off in the night, and I'll fend the bite

[Chorus]
What am I supposed to do, but sink my teeth in you?
I starve without you on my lips, I die without the taste of it
What am I supposed to be when you sink your teeth in me?
'Cause I live for the way you move, I'd die without the taste of you

When you'rе away from me
I'm cravingly impatient, chained up to the bed
Inside my head (Inside my head)
And I don't care
I'm a bitch if I'm not getting my addiction fed
I'll end up dead (End up dead)

[Pre-Chorus]
All wrongs do me right, I dig my nails in dynamite
I might go off in the night, and I'll fend the bite

[Chorus]
What am I supposed to do, but sink my teeth in you?
I starve without you on my lips, I'd die without the taste of it
What am I supposed to be when you sink your teeth in me?
'Cause I live for the way you move, I'd die without the taste of you
What am I supposed to do, but sink my teeth in you?
I starve without you on my lips, I'd die without the taste of it
What am I supposed to be when you sink your teeth in me?
'Cause I live for the way you move, I'd die without the taste of you

[Outro]
(Taste of you)
