I am flesh and I am bone
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter and gold
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter

[Verse 1]
Do you walk in the valley of kings?
Do you walk in the shadow of men
Who sold their lives to a dream?
Do you ponder the manner of things
In the dark
The dark, the dark, the dark

[Chorus]
I am flesh and I am bone
I'll rise ting ting like glitter and gold
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter

[Verse 2]
Do you walk in the meadow of spring?
Do you talk to the animals?
Do you hold their lives from a string?
Do you ponder the manner of things
In the dark
The dark, the dark, the dark

[Chorus]
I am flesh and I am bone
I'll rise ting ting like glitter and gold
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter
I am flesh and I am bone
I'll rise ting ting like glitter and gold
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter

[Bridge]
'Cause everybody in the backroom's spinning out
Don't remember what you're asking for
And everybody in the front room's tripping out
You left your bottle at the door
Cause everybody in the backroom's spinning out
Don't remember what you're asking for
And everybody in the front room's tripping out
You left your bottle at the door
[Chorus]
I am flesh and I am bone
I'll rise ting ting like glitter and gold
I've got fire in my soul
Rise up, ting ting, like glitter
