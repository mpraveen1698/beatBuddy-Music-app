6 ContributorsRun Free Lyrics[Verse 1: IVIE]
I still remember
Loving the danger
You set me on fire
When I'm by your side
You taking me higher
I follow you down if we go down
Now you say you wanna get away
You wanna take me all the way

[Pre-Chorus: IVIE]
Might get burned if you get too closer
To the sun (I want yah)
We can burn together
Fading into one another
Ohh!!!

[Chorus: IVIE]
Well don't you know
You're still heaven to me
Baby, we could run free
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
Never mind all our worries
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
You might also like[Verse 2: IVIE]
My deepest of secrets
Trust you to keep 'em
Hiding the worlds
You cannot say
I got what you wanted
I got what you needed
It's all in the way
That you say my name

[Pre-Chorus: IVIE]
Might get burned if you get too closer
To the sun (I want yah)
We can burn together
Fading into one another
Ohh!!!

[Chorus: IVIE]
Well don't you know
You're still heaven to me
Baby, we could run free
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
Never mind all our worries
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
Never mind all our worries
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you3Embed Run Free Run Free Deep Chills;IVIE house
