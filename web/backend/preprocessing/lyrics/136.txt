15 ContributorsWords Lyrics[Intro]
I got the words "I love you"
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue

[Verse 1]
At your house again
Are we more than friends?
There's so much that I wanna say
But I gotta hold it back
So scared how you'll react
I just hide it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
I could give you it all in a minute
We'll fall any minute
But we go 'round and 'round
I don't wanna mention commitment
But I feel it slippin'
So please don't let me down, me down

[Chorus]
I got the words "I love you"
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue
Oh, I feel like
As soon as they leave my mouth
You're just gonna get up and run
You're gonna run away
You might also like[Verse 2]
You know we connect
More than just the sex
But arе you gonna let me in?
I can set your world on firе
But you're holdin' the lighter
Instead, you're puttin' out our flame

[Pre-Chorus]
I could give you it all in a minute
We'll fall any minute
But we go 'round and 'round
I don't wanna mention commitment
But I feel it slippin'
So please don't let me down

[Chorus]
I got the words "I love you"
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue
Oh, I feel like
As soon as they leave my mouth
You're just gonna get up and run
You're gonna run away (Run)
Run away (Run)
Run away (Run)
I got the words "I love you"
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue
Oh, I feel like
As soon as they leave my mouth
You're just gonna get up and run
You're gonna run away
[Outro]
If I say it now
Then one day, I'll wake up
And you walked out (You walked out)
So I just stay here with the words "I love you"
Sittin' on the tip of my tongue (Sittin' on the tip of my tongue)6Embed Words (feat. Zara Larsson) Words (feat. Zara Larsson) Alesso;Zara Larsson house
