2 ContributorsCrazy LyricsDrinking on a Wednesday
I'm searching for a hideaway
Drinking on some beers
Can't wait till it's Friday

Such a rollercoaster
Living on a sofa
Such a pretty day
But I can't wait till it's over

It is making me crazy
It is making me lazy
It is making me angry
It is making me grumpy

It makes me feel older
It makes me feel bolder
It makes me feel tired
It makes me a liar

It is making me crazy
It is making me lazy
It is making me angry
It is making me grumpy

Get a life you're sober
Don't justify hangovers
Face this given day
Don't waste this other way

I have to keep on drinking on for years
It's making me crazy
It's making me lazy

I have to keep on drinking on for years
It makes me feel older
It makes me feel bolder

I have to keep on laughing in the mirror
Keep on drinking on for years
Its making me crazy
Its making me lazy

I have to keep on laughing in the mirror
Keep on drinking on for years

It makes me feel bolder

It is making me crazy
(Whats wrong with my mind)
It is making me lazy
(I'm tired of fighting)
It is making me angry
(So angry, always tensed)
It is making me grumpy
(I just wanna sing and dance)
It makes me feel older
(What's wrong with my mind)
It makes me feel bolder
(Leave a message to my soul)
It makes me feel tired
(So angry always tensed)
It makes me a liar
(I just wanna sing and dance)Embed Crazy Crazy Alex Cruz;Brascon;Rubenson deep-house
