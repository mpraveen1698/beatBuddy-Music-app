Introduced me to your family
Watched my favorite shows on your TV
Made me breakfast in the mornin'
When you got home from work

[Verse 2]
Makin' plans to travel 'round the world
Said we'd always put each other first
Old love songs we used to play to
Funny, now I hate you

[Chorus]
Now, I
Remember when you'd call me late at night
I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you
And all your daddy issues
But now, I don't even miss you anymore
So, I
I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent givin' advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed

[Verse 3]
Shoulda paid attention to my friends
Tellin' me how bad it's gonna end
Always givin' their opinions
Now I wish I would have listened
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I could say I'm sorry, but I'm not
You don't deserve the one thing that you lost

[Chorus]
Now, I
Remember when you'd call me late at night
And I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you
And all your daddy issues
But now, I don't even miss you anymore
So, I
I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent givin' advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Your fingers crossed
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Your fingers crossed
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Oh, when you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed

[Outro]
Oh, I
I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent giving advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
Wish you said you loved me
When you didn't have your fingers crossed17Embed Fingers Crossed Fingers Crossed Lauren Spencer Smith singer-songwriter
