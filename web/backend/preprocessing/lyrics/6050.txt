Shoulda been open
Shoulda done more
Shoulda learned a lesson from the year before
Shoulda been honest
Shoulda just cried
Shoulda told me there was nothing left inside

[Chorus]
Now the road keeps rolling on forever
And the years keep pulling us apart
We lost something, I still wonder what it was
It shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, but it does

[Verse 2]
You shoulda just broken
You shoulda come clean
You shoulda been sad instead of being so fucking mean
It shouldn't be easy
But it shouldn't be hard
You shouldn't be a stranger in your own backyard

[Chorus]
Now the road keeps rolling on forever
And the years keep pulling us apart
I know it's over, I'm just saying this because
It shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, but it does
You might also like[Verse 3]
I shouldn't be angry
I shouldn't hold on
I shouldn't leave you messages in every little song
It could have been always
It could have been me
We could have been busy naming baby number three

[Chorus]
Now the road keeps rolling on forever
And the years keep pulling us apart
If it's on someone then I blame the both of us
It shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, but it
Shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, but it
Shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, but it doesEmbed Shouldn't Matter but It Does Sob Rock John Mayer singer-songwriter
