6 ContributorsNeed You LyricsI don't know how but I recall that whole dream
I was always shit at that
We were at a drive-in, junior mint kissing clean
We were parked in the back
They were showing some A24 pair I'd seen
Beautiful and full of sad
And then I get so light headed like her on the screen
I might be going mad

Somehow in the dream you knew that my heart would break
Semi-automatically
You said, "when you can't find quite enough air there to take
Copy how I breathe"
We were doubled up and crying
You were right there by me
Midsummer empathy
See how I need you

[Chorus]
Everyone goes
Everyone gives up the ghost
Us too
Let it be known
All the proud hours I hold
Are around you
See us in red and black
Mirrored white ocher hues
I won't give one thing back
That's how bad I need you
You might also likeEyes are dry, second film is on
Cinephiles recognize it from tone
You took a smoke break
I knew what that meant
So long to past tense
You know I'm aggressively allergic
I'm sick of this party
And we have to go home early
Windows are down, I'm alright
And I don't blame you
For telephone pole bad news
No blood, no revenue
See, I still need you

[Chorus]
Everyone goes
Everyone gives up the ghost
Us too
Let it be known
All the proud hours I hold
Are around you
See us in red and black
Mirrored white ocher hues
I won't give one thing back
That's how bad I need you
(I'm a full kit fan who follows)
That's how bad I need you
(Here comes good news, here comes sorrow)
How bad I need you
(Here comes all of me, that's gospel truth)
