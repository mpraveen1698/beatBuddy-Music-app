6 ContributorsSleepless Lyrics[Intro]
My, oh, my, oh, my
Why? Oh, why? Oh, why?

[Chorus]
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my
Why's it every night I'm feeling so sleepless?
Oh, why? Oh, why? Oh, why?
I'm losing my mind, maybe you're the reason

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause, darling, I'm scared that you
Might wake up loving someone new
And, darling, I'm scared
When everything leads back to you

[Verse 1]
Started as friends
But less than lovers
It's all making sense
On days I'm thinking about us
I can't pretend
I never wondered
If you'll need me like I've needed you
Yeah
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm so selfish
Hate the thought of someone else
Making you laugh, smiling, happy
If it ain't me or myself
I overthink, over obsess
That's what I do best
And if they'd ask me, I'd say

[Chorus]
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my
Why's it every night I'm feeling so sleepless?
Oh, why? Oh, why? Oh, why?
I'm losing my mind, maybe you're the reason

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause, darling, I'm scared that you
Might wake up loving someone new
And, darling, I'm scared
When everything leads back to you

[Verse 2]
My shallow pride
Aging like whisky
You know I try
But I lose myself when you're gone
I know in time
I'll find it easy
But till then, won't you promise I'm yours?
[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm so selfish
Hate the thought of someone else
Making you laugh, smiling, happy
If it ain't me or myself
I overthink, over obsess
That's what I do best
And if they'd ask me, I'd say

[Chorus]
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my
Why's it every night I'm feeling so sleepless?
Oh, why? Oh, why? Oh, why?
I'm losing my mind, maybe you're the reason (Oh, woah)

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause, darling, I'm scared that you
Might wake up loving someone new
And, darling, I'm scared
When everything leads back to you1Embed Sleepless Sleepless Dutch Melrose soul
