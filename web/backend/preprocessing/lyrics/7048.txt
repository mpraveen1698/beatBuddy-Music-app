Broken down so I walk the line
I drown my wounds in iodine
I'm out of money, I'm out of time
I fly low like a broken arrow
Time slows and my vision narrows
I'm out of money, I'm out of time

[Chorus]
Sing your hearts out sing it loud
Make me happy make me proud
Black holes, solid ground
Black holes, solid ground
A thousand voices set 'em free
Because this silence is killing me

[Verse 2]
Iâ€™m still alive beneath the rubble
A wretched soul in a sea of trouble
I'm all alone
I'm all alone
Start the fire, set it off
Good intentions are wearing out
I don't know I'm all alone (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Sing your hearts out sing it loud
Make me happy make me proud
Black holes, solid ground
Black holes, solid ground
A thousand voices set 'em free
Because this silence is killing me

[Chorus]
Sing your hearts out sing it loud
Make me happy make me proud
Black holes, solid ground
Black holes, solid ground
A thousand voices set 'em free
Because this silence is killing me
