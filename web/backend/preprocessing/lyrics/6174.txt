Why you always tryna spend my money?
Why you always gotta act so funny?
I got six gold chains on and I'm goin' dummy
While your bitch give me brains in the back of the Hummer
California girls fuckin' with me in the summer
It's that California world shit, California cutta

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Peep]
Why you always tryna spend my money?
Why you always gotta act so funny?
I got six gold chains on and I'm goin' dummy
While your bitch give me brains in the back of the Hummer
California girls fuckin' with me in the summer
It's that California world shit, California cutta
Cali-California girls fuckin' with me in the summer
It's that California world shit

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Lights out, baby, it's on
I'm 'bout to make a stain on your Louis Vuitton
If you fuckin' with a lame then this is your song
'Cause I wrote it with your name on the tip of my tongue (The tip of my tongue)
Lights out, baby, it's on
I'm 'bout to make a stain on your Louis Vuitton
If you fuckin' with a lame then this is your song
'Cause I wrote it with your name on the tip of my tongue (The tip of my tongue)

Fuck you, bitch, I'm breakin' bitches, pimpin', sell a nigga's hoes
