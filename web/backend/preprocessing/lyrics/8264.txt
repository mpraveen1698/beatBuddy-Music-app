You say I make you nervous, a tragedy
I'm a beautiful disaster, a reckoning
You wonder how I got this way (You wonder how I got this way)
You think I'm someone to be saved
Someone to clean up and tame
Oh, some things never change, never change, oh
You think I would look pretty on your arm
Once you cover up my bruises and battle scars
But it always ends the same (But it always ends the same)
Can't bear the things I've had to face
Got you crying on your knees in pain
Oh, some things never change, never change, oh
[Chorus: RIELL]
You'll break your back to make me feel again
Suffocate to make me breathe again
Lose your mind from endless praying
Some things never change, never change, oh
Redemption never came
[Verse 2: RIELL]
I stopped asking for forgiveness 'cause you should know
Only fools tread where the angels fear to go
But you keep trying to get too close
(But you keep trying to get too close)
Saved myself by turning into stone
So save your judgment 'cause you just don't know
But some things never change, never change, oh
They say I should feel guilty and change my ways
Leaving crumpled bodies in my wake
Swear I didn't mean to make them break
(Swear I didn't mean to make them break)
But they're so delicate and so mundane
And they keep coming like a moth to flame
Oh some things never change, never change, mm-hm

You'll break your back to make me feel again
Suffocate to make me breathe again
Lose your mind from endless praying
Some things never change, never change, oh
