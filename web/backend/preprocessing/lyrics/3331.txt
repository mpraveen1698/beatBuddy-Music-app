Throwin’ poison seeds into the wind
Make the poison tree to grow in me begin
Let your branches fork my veins
Let your honey tide in me
Blood lovin’, poison whisperin’

[Chorus]
Oh, beautiful poison tree
Let your power grow in me
Let your sorrow flow in me
Take away my blood and bones
Make your flowers deep inside of me

[Verse 2]
Least I’ll still have company
My inside, tiny poison tree
I’ll seal my love in me
Tiny beautiful poison tree

[Chorus]
Oh, beautiful poison tree
Let your power grow in me
Let your sorrows sow in me
Turn me into a poison tree

Turn me into a poison tree
Make my shadow go away
Make my branches strong and hard
Make my leaves flower and spread
Make me feel like something powerful is growing deep inside of me
Turn me into a poison tree7Embed Poison Tree Inca Ore / Grouper Grouper ambient
