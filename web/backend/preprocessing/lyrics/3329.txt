Ooh
Ooh, da-da-da-da-da
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Hello, you awake right now?
God, I just need to hear the sound of you
Please calm me down
And I know that it's selfish, but
You are the only thing that's
Ever made sense to me, I
I don't wanna do this
I don't know how to do this without you
Cling to your side, voices at night
Cover my eyes, I'm terrified
No in between, a face on a screen
Ain't an adequate replacement for your being with me (Yeah-yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Too much time in the limelight
Gimme your all on the landline
Want it so bad, but I won't lie
And it just gets worse in the nighttime
Never stays for long (Ooh, da-da-da-da-da)
And she's gone in the morning (Ooh)
You might also like[Chorus]
When you come home
I just got over bein' less of you
When you leave me, I'm in pieces
Maybe it's better if we cut it loose

[Verse 2]
Tell me how your day was
No, I'm not okay
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Time never moved so slow
Bed time, hit your phone up
Tell me where to go, where to go
Tell me where to go, where to go-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Too much time in the limelight
Gimme your all on the landline
Want it so bad, but I won't lie
And it just gets worse in the nighttime
Never stays for long (Ooh, da-da-da-da-da)
And she's gone in the morning (Ooh)

[Chorus]
When you come home
I just got over bein' less of you
When you leave me, I'm in pieces
Maybe it's better if we cut it loose
[Refrain]
I don't know how to do this without you
I don't know, I don't know, don't know
I don't know how to do this without you
I don't know, I don't know, don't know
I don't know how to do this without you
