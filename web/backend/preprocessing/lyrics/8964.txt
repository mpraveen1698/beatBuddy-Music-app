1 ContributorCasa Guidi Windows 1 LyricsI heard last night a little child go singing
       &nbsp’Neath Casa Guidi windows, by the church,
O bella libertà, O bella!—stringing
       &nbspThe same words still on notes he went in search
So high for, you concluded the upspringing
       &nbspOf such a nimble bird to sky from perch
Must leave the whole bush in a tremble green,
       &nbspAnd that the heart of Italy must beat,
While such a voice had leave to rise serene
       &nbsp’Twixt church and palace of a Florence street:
A little child, too, who not long had been
       &nbspBy mother’s finger steadied on his feet,
And still O bella libertà he sang.


Then I thought, musing, of the innumerous
       &nbspSweet songs which still for Italy outrang
From older singers’ lips who sang not thus
       &nbspExultingly and purely, yet, with pang
Fast sheathed in music, touched the heart of us
       &nbspSo finely that the pity scarcely pained.
I thought how Filicaja led on others,
       &nbspBewailers for their Italy enchained,
And how they called her childless among mothers,
       &nbspWidow of empires, ay, and scarce refrained
Cursing her beauty to her face, as brothers
       &nbspMight a shamed sister’s,—“Had she been less fair
She were less wretched;”—how, evoking so
       &nbspFrom congregated wrong and heaped despair
Of men and women writhing under blow,
       &nbspHarrowed and hideous in a filthy lair,
Some personating Image wherein woe
       &nbspWas wrapt in beauty from offending much,
They called it Cybele, or Niobe,
       &nbspOr laid it corpse-like on a bier for such,
Where all the world might drop for Italy
       &nbspThose cadenced tears which burn not where they touch,—
“Juliet of nations, canst thou die as we?
       &nbspAnd was the violet crown that crowned thy head
So over-large, though new buds made it rough,
       &nbspIt slipped down and across thine eyelids dead,
O sweet, fair Juliet?” Of such songs enough,
       &nbspToo many of such complaints! behold, instead,
Void at Verona, Juliet’s marble trough:
       &nbspAs void as that is, are all images
Men set between themselves and actual wrong,
       &nbspTo catch the weight of pity, meet the stress
Of conscience,—since ’t is easier to gaze long
       &nbspOn mournful masks and sad effigies
Than on real, live, weak creatures crushed by strong.

For me who stand in Italy to-day
       &nbspWhere worthier poets stood and sang before,
I kiss their footsteps yet their words gainsay.
       &nbspI can but muse in hope upon this shore
Of golden Arno as it shoots away
       &nbspThrough Florence’ heart beneath her bridges four:
Bent bridges, seeming to strain off like bows,
       &nbspAnd tremble while the arrowy undertide
Shoots on and cleaves the marble as it goes,
       &nbspAnd strikes up palace-walls on either side,
And froths the cornice out in glittering rows,
       &nbspWith doors and windows quaintly multiplied,
And terrace-sweeps, and gazers upon all,
       &nbspBy whom if flower or kerchief were thrown out
From any lattice there, the same would fall
       &nbspInto the river underneath, no doubt,
It runs so close and fast ’twixt wall and wall.
       &nbspHow beautiful! the mountains from without
In silence listen for the word said next.
       &nbspWhat word will men say,—here where Giotto planted
His campanile like an unperplexed
       &nbspFine question Heavenward, touching the things granted
A noble people who, being greatly vexed
       &nbspIn act, in aspiration keep undaunted?
What word will God say? Michel’s Night and Day
       &nbspAnd Dawn and Twilight wait in marble scorn
Like dogs upon a dunghill, couched on clay
       &nbspFrom whence the Medicean stamp’s outworn,
The final putting off of all such sway
       &nbspBy all such hands, and freeing of the unborn
In Florence and the great world outside Florence.
       &nbspThree hundred years his patient statues wait
In that small chapel of the dim Saint Lawrence:
       &nbspDay’s eyes are breaking bold and passionate
Over his shoulder, and will flash abhorrence
       &nbspOn darkness and with level looks meet fate,
When once loose from that marble film of theirs;
       &nbspThe Night has wild dreams in her sleep, the Dawn
Is haggard as the sleepless, Twilight wears
       &nbspA sort of horror; as the veil withdrawn
’Twixt the artist’s soul and works had left them heirs
       &nbspOf speechless thoughts which would not quail nor fawn,
Of angers and contempts, of hope and love:
       &nbspFor not without a meaning did he place
The princely Urbino on the seat above
       &nbspWith everlasting shadow on his face,
While the slow dawns and twilights disapprove
       &nbspThe ashes of his long-extinguished race
Which never more shall clog the feet of men.
       &nbspI do believe, divinest Angelo,
That winter-hour in Via Larga, when
       &nbspThey bade thee build a statue up in snow
And straight that marvel of thine art again
       &nbspDissolved beneath the sun’s Italian glow,
Thine eyes, dilated with the plastic passion,
       &nbspThawing too in drops of wounded manhood, since,
To mock alike thine art and indignation,
       &nbspLaughed at the palace-window the new prince,—
(“Aha! this genius needs for exaltation,
       &nbspWhen all’s said and however the proud may wince,
A little marble from our princely mines!”)
       &nbspI do believe that hour thou laughedst too
For the whole sad world and for thy Florentines,
       &nbspAfter those few tears, which were only few!
That as, beneath the sun, the grand white lines
       &nbspOf thy snow-statue trembled and withdrew,—
The head, erect as Jove’s, being palsied first,
       &nbspThe eyelids flattened, the full brow turned blank,
The right-hand, raised but now as if it cursed,
       &nbspDropt, a mere snowball, (till the people sank
Their voices, though a louder laughter burst
       &nbspFrom the royal window)—thou couldst proudly thank
God and the prince for promise and presage,
       &nbspAnd laugh the laugh back, I think verily,
Thine eyes being purged by tears of righteous rage
       &nbspTo read a wrong into a prophecy,
And measure a true great man’s heritage
       &nbspAgainst a mere great-duke’s posterity.
I think thy soul said then, “I do not need
       &nbspA princedom and its quarries, after all;
For if I write, paint, carve a word, indeed,
       &nbspOn book or board or dust, on floor or wall,
The same is kept of God who taketh heed
       &nbspThat not a letter of the meaning fall
Or ere it touch and teach His world’s deep heart,
       &nbspOutlasting, therefore, all your lordships, sir!
So keep your stone, beseech you, for your part,
       &nbspTo cover up your grave-place and refer
The proper titles; I live by my art.
       &nbspThe thought I threw into this snow shall stir
This gazing people when their gaze is done;
       &nbspAnd the tradition of your act and mine,
When all the snow is melted in the sun,
       &nbspShall gather up, for unborn men, a sign
Of what is the true princedom,—ay, and none
       &nbspShall laugh that day, except the drunk with wine.”

Amen, great Angelo! the day’s at hand.
       &nbspIf many laugh not on it, shall we weep?
Much more we must not, let us understand.
       &nbspThrough rhymers sonneteering in their sleep
And archaists mumbling dry bones up the land
       &nbspAnd sketchers lauding ruined towns a-heap,—
Through all that drowsy hum of voices smooth,
       &nbspThe hopeful bird mounts carolling from brake,
The hopeful child, with leaps to catch his growth,
       &nbspSings open-eyed for liberty’s sweet sake:
And I, a singer also from my youth,
       &nbspPrefer to sing with these who are awake,
With birds, with babes, with men who will not fear
       &nbspThe baptism of the holy morning dew,
(And many of such wakers now are here,
       &nbspComplete in their anointed manhood, who
Will greatly dare and greatlier persevere,)
       &nbspThan join those old thin voices with my new,
And sigh for Italy with some safe sigh
       &nbspCooped up in music ’twixt an oh and ah,—
Nay, hand in hand with that young child, will I
       &nbspGo singing rather, “Bella libertà,”
Than, with those poets, croon the dead or cry
       &nbsp“Se tu men bella fossi, Italia!”

“Less wretched if less fair.” Perhaps a truth
       &nbspIs so far plain in this, that Italy,
Long trammelled with the purple of her youth
       &nbspAgainst her age’s ripe activity,
Sits still upon her tombs, without death’s ruth
       &nbspBut also without life’s brave energy.
“Now tell us what is Italy?” men ask:
       &nbspAnd others answer, “Virgil, Cicero,
Catullus, Cæsar.” What beside? to task
       &nbspThe memory closer—“Why, Boccaccio,
Dante, Petrarca,”—and if still the flask
       &nbspAppears to yield its wine by drops too slow,—
“Angelo, Raffael, Pergolese,”—all
       &nbspWhose strong hearts beat through stone, or charged again
The paints with fire of souls electrical,
       &nbspOr broke up heaven for music. What more then?
Why, then, no more. The chaplet’s last beads fall
       &nbspIn naming the last saintship within ken,
And, after that, none prayeth in the land.
       &nbspAlas, this Italy has too long swept
Heroic ashes up for hour-glass sand;
       &nbspOf her own past, impassioned nympholept!
Consenting to be nailed here by the hand
       &nbspTo the very bay-tree under which she stept
A queen of old, and plucked a leafy branch;
       &nbspAnd, licensing the world too long indeed
To use her broad phylacteries to staunch
       &nbspAnd stop her bloody lips, she takes no heed
How one clear word would draw an avalanche
       &nbspOf living sons around her, to succeed
The vanished generations. Can she count
       &nbspThese oil-eaters with large live mobile mouths
Agape for macaroni, in the amount
       &nbspOf consecrated heroes of her south’s
Bright rosary? The pitcher at the fount,
       &nbspThe gift of gods, being broken, she much loathes
To let the ground-leaves of the place confer
       &nbspA natural bowl. So henceforth she would seem
No nation, but the poet’s pensioner,
       &nbspWith alms from every land of song and dream,
While aye her pipers sadly pipe of her
       &nbspUntil their proper breaths, in that extreme
Of sighing, split the reed on which they played:
       &nbspOf which, no more. But never say “no more”
To Italy’s life! Her memories undismayed
       &nbspStill argue “evermore;” her graves implore
Her future to be strong and not afraid;
       &nbspHer very statues send their looks before.


We do not serve the dead—the past is past.
       &nbspGod lives, and lifts His glorious mornings up
Before the eyes of men awake at last,
       &nbspWho put away the meats they used to sup,
And down upon the dust of earth outcast
       &nbspThe dregs remaining of the ancient cup,
Then turn to wakeful prayer and worthy act.
       &nbspThe Dead, upon their awful ’vantage ground,
The sun not in their faces, shall abstract
       &nbspNo more our strength; we will not be discrowned
As guardians of their crowns, nor deign transact
       &nbspA barter of the present, for a sound
Of good so counted in the foregone days.
       &nbspO Dead, ye shall no longer cling to us
With rigid hands of desiccating praise,
       &nbspAnd drag us backward by the garment thus,
To stand and laud you in long-drawn virelays!
       &nbspWe will not henceforth be oblivious
Of our own lives, because ye lived before,
       &nbspNor of our acts, because ye acted well.
We thank you that ye first unlatched the door,
       &nbspBut will not make it inaccessible
By thankings on the threshold any more.
       &nbspWe hurry onward to extinguish hell
With our fresh souls, our younger hope, and God’s
       &nbspMaturity of purpose. Soon shall we
Die also! and, that then our periods
       &nbspOf life may round themselves to memory
As smoothly as on our graves the burial-sods,
       &nbspWe now must look to it to excel as ye,
And bear our age as far, unlimited
       &nbspBy the last mind-mark; so, to be invoked
By future generations, as their Dead.


’T is true that when the dust of death has choked
       &nbspA great man’s voice, the common words he said
Turn oracles, the common thoughts he yoked
       &nbspLike horses, draw like griffins: this is true
And acceptable. I, too, should desire,
       &nbspWhen men make record, with the flowers they strew,
“Savonarola’s soul went out in fire
       &nbspUpon our Grand-duke’s piazza, and burned through
A moment first, or ere he did expire,
       &nbspThe veil betwixt the right and wrong, and showed
How near God sat and judged the judges there,—”
       &nbspUpon the self-same pavement overstrewed
To cast my violets with as reverent care,
       &nbspAnd prove that all the winters which have snowed
Cannot snow out the scent from stones and air,
       &nbspOf a sincere man’s virtues. This was he,
Savonarola, who, while Peter sank
       &nbspWith his whole boat-load, called courageously
“Wake Christ, wake Christ!”—who, having tried the tank
       &nbspOf old church-waters used for baptistry
Ere Luther came to spill them, swore they stank;
       &nbspWho also by a princely deathbed cried,
“Loose Florence, or God will not loose thy soul!”
       &nbspThen fell back the Magnificent and died
Beneath the star-look shooting from the cowl,
       &nbspWhich turned to wormwood-bitterness the wide
Deep sea of his ambitions. It were foul
       &nbspTo grudge Savonarola and the rest
Their violets: rather pay them quick and fresh!
       &nbspThe emphasis of death makes manifest
The eloquence of action in our flesh;
       &nbspAnd men who, living, were but dimly guessed,
When once free from their life’s entangled mesh,
       &nbspShow their full length in graves, or oft indeed
Exaggerate their stature, in the flat,
       &nbspTo noble admirations which exceed
Most nobly, yet will calculate in that
       &nbspBut accurately. We, who are the seed
Of buried creatures, if we turned and spat
       &nbspUpon our antecedents, we were vile.
Bring violets rather. If these had not walked
       &nbspTheir furlong, could we hope to walk our mile?
Therefore bring violets. Yet if we self-baulked
       &nbspStand still, a-strewing violets all the while,
These moved in vain, of whom we have vainly talked.
       &nbspSo rise up henceforth with a cheerful smile,
And having strewn the violets, reap the corn,
       &nbspAnd having reaped and garnered, bring the plough
And draw new furrows ’neath the healthy morn,
       &nbspAnd plant the great Hereafter in this Now.


Of old ’t was so. How step by step was worn,
       &nbspAs each man gained on each securely!—how
Each by his own strength sought his own Ideal,—
       &nbspThe ultimate Perfection leaning bright
From out the sun and stars to bless the leal
       &nbspAnd earnest search of all for Fair and Right
Through doubtful forms by earth accounted real!
       &nbspBecause old Jubal blew into delight
The souls of men with clear-piped melodies,
       &nbspIf youthful Asaph were content at most
To draw from Jubal’s grave, with listening eyes,
       &nbspTraditionary music’s floating ghost
Into the grass-grown silence, were it wise?
       &nbspAnd was ’t not wiser, Jubal’s breath being lost,
That Miriam clashed her cymbals to surprise
       &nbspThe sun between her white arms flung apart,
With new glad golden sounds? that David’s strings
       &nbspO’erflowed his hand with music from his heart?
So harmony grows full from many springs,
       &nbspAnd happy accident turns holy art.


You enter, in your Florence wanderings,
       &nbspThe church of Saint Maria Novella. Pass
The left stair, where at plague-time Machiavel
       &nbspSaw One with set fair face as in a glass,
Dressed out against the fear of death and hell,
       &nbspRustling her silks in pauses of the mass,
To keep the thought off how her husband fell,
       &nbspWhen she left home, stark dead across her feet,—
The stair leads up to what the Orgagnas save
       &nbspOf Dante’s dæmons; you, in passing it,
Ascend the right stair from the farther nave
       &nbspTo muse in a small chapel scarcely lit
By Cimabue’s Virgin. Bright and brave,
       &nbspThat picture was accounted, mark, of old:
A king stood bare before its sovran grace,
       &nbspA reverent people shouted to behold
The picture, not the king, and even the place
       &nbspContaining such a miracle grew bold,
Named the Glad Borgo from that beauteous face
       &nbspWhich thrilled the artist, after work, to think
His own ideal Mary-smile should stand
       &nbspSo very near him,—he, within the brink
Of all that glory, let in by his hand
       &nbspWith too divine a rashness! Yet none shrink
Who come to gaze here now; albeit ’t was planned
       &nbspSublimely in the thought’s simplicity:
The Lady, throned in empyreal state,
       &nbspMinds only the young Babe upon her knee,
While sidelong angels bear the royal weight,
       &nbspProstrated meekly, smiling tenderly
Oblivion of their wings; the Child thereat
       &nbspStretching its hand like God. If any should,
Because of some stiff draperies and loose joints,
       &nbspGaze scorn down from the heights of Raffaelhood
On Cimabue’s picture,—Heaven anoints
       &nbspThe head of no such critic, and his blood
The poet’s curse strikes full on and appoints
       &nbspTo ague and cold spasms for evermore.
A noble picture! worthy of the shout
       &nbspWherewith along the streets the people bore
Its cherub-faces which the sun threw out
       &nbspUntil they stooped and entered the church door.
Yet rightly was young Giotto talked about,
       &nbspWhom Cimabue found among the sheep,
And knew, as gods know gods, and carried home
       &nbspTo paint the things he had painted, with a deep
And fuller insight, and so overcome
       &nbspHis chapel-Lady with a heavenlier sweep
Of light: for thus we mount into the sum
       &nbspOf great things known or acted. I hold, too,
That Cimabue smiled upon the lad
       &nbspAt the first stroke which passed what he could do,
Or else his Virgin’s smile had never had
       &nbspSuch sweetness in ’t. All great men who foreknew
Their heirs in art, for art’s sake have been glad,
       &nbspAnd bent their old white heads as if uncrowned,
Fanatics of their pure Ideals still
       &nbspFar more than of their triumphs, which were found
With some less vehement struggle of the will.
       &nbspIf old Margheritone trembled, swooned
And died despairing at the open sill
       &nbspOf other men’s achievements (who achieved,
By loving art beyond the master), he
       &nbspWas old Margheritone, and conceived
Never, at first youth and most ecstasy,
       &nbspA Virgin like that dream of one, which heaved
The death-sigh from his heart. If wistfully
       &nbspMargheritone sickened at the smell
Of Cimabue’s laurel, let him go!
       &nbspFor Cimabue stood up very well
In spite of Giotto’s, and Angelico
       &nbspThe artist-saint kept smiling in his cell
The smile with which he welcomed the sweet slow
       &nbspInbreak of angels (whitening through the dim
That he might paint them), while the sudden sense
       &nbspOf Raffael’s future was revealed to him
By force of his own fair works’ competence.
       &nbspThe same blue waters where the dolphins swim
Suggest the tritons. Through the blue Immense
       &nbspStrike out, all swimmers! cling not in the way
Of one another, so to sink; but learn
       &nbspThe strong man’s impulse, catch the freshening spray
He throws up in his motions, and discern
       &nbspBy his clear westering eye, the time of day.
Thou, God, hast set us worthy gifts to earn
       &nbspBesides Thy heaven and Thee! and when I say
There’s room here for the weakest man alive
       &nbspTo live and die, there’s room too, I repeat,
For all the strongest to live well, and strive
       &nbspTheir own way, by their individual heat,—
Like some new bee-swarm leaving the old hive,
       &nbspDespite the wax which tempts so violet-sweet.
Then let the living live, the dead retain
       &nbspTheir grave-cold flowers!—though honour’s best supplied
By bringing actions, to prove theirs not vain.


Cold graves, we say? it shall be testified
       &nbspThat living men who burn in heart and brain,
Without the dead were colder. If we tried
       &nbspTo sink the past beneath our feet, be sure
The future would not stand. Precipitate
       &nbspThis old roof from the shrine, and, insecure,
The nesting swallows fly off, mate from mate.
       &nbspHow scant the gardens, if the graves were fewer!
The tall green poplars grew no longer straight
       &nbspWhose tops not looked to Troy. Would any fight
For Athens, and not swear by Marathon?
       &nbspWho dared build temples, without tombs in sight?
Or live, without some dead man’s benison?
       &nbspOr seek truth, hope for good, and strive for right,
If, looking up, he saw not in the sun
       &nbspSome angel of the martyrs all day long
Standing and waiting? Your last rhythm will need
       &nbspYour earliest key-note. Could I sing this song,
If my dead masters had not taken heed
       &nbspTo help the heavens and earth to make me strong,
As the wind ever will find out some reed
       &nbspAnd touch it to such issues as belong
To such a frail thing? None may grudge the Dead
       &nbspLibations from full cups. Unless we choose
To look back to the hills behind us spread,
       &nbspThe plains before us sadden and confuse;
If orphaned, we are disinherited.


I would but turn these lachrymals to use,
       &nbspAnd pour fresh oil in from the olive-grove,
To furnish them as new lamps. Shall I say
       &nbspWhat made my heart beat with exulting love
A few weeks back?—


       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspThe day was such a day
As Florence owes the sun. The sky above,
       &nbspIts weight upon the mountains seemed to lay,
And palpitate in glory, like a dove
       &nbspWho has flown too fast, full-hearted—take away
The image! for the heart of man beat higher
       &nbspThat day in Florence, flooding all her streets
And piazzas with a tumult and desire.
       &nbspThe people, with accumulated heats
And faces turned one way, as if one fire
       &nbspBoth drew and flushed them, left their ancient beats
And went up toward the palace-Pitti wall
       &nbspTo thank their Grand-duke who, not quite of course,
Had graciously permitted, at their call,
       &nbspThe citizens to use their civic force
To guard their civic homes. So, one and all,
       &nbspThe Tuscan cities streamed up to the source
Of this new good at Florence, taking it
       &nbspAs good so far, presageful of more good,—
The first torch of Italian freedom, lit
       &nbspTo toss in the next tiger’s face who should
Approach too near them in a greedy fit,—
       &nbspThe first pulse of an even flow of blood
To prove the level of Italian veins
       &nbspTowards rights perceived and granted. How we gazed
From Casa Guidi windows while, in trains
       &nbspOf orderly procession—banners raised,
And intermittent bursts of martial strains
       &nbspWhich died upon the shout, as if amazed
By gladness beyond music—they passed on!
       &nbspThe Magistracy, with insignia, passed,—
And all the people shouted in the sun,
       &nbspAnd all the thousand windows which had cast
A ripple of silks in blue and scarlet down
       &nbsp(As if the houses overflowed at last),
Seemed growing larger with fair heads and eyes.
       &nbspThe Lawyers passed,—and still arose the shout,
And hands broke from the windows to surprise
       &nbspThose grave calm brows with bay-tree leaves thrown out.
The Priesthood passed,—the friars with worldly-wise
       &nbspKeen sidelong glances from their beards about
The street to see who shouted; many a monk
       &nbspWho takes a long rope in the waist, was there:
Whereat the popular exultation drunk
       &nbspWith indrawn “vivas” the whole sunny air,
While through the murmuring windows rose and sunk
       &nbspA cloud of kerchiefed hands,—“The church makes fair
Her welcome in the new Pope’s name.” Ensued
       &nbspThe black sign of the “Martyrs”—(name no name,
But count the graves in silence). Next were viewed
       &nbspThe Artists; next, the Trades; and after came
The People,—flag and sign, and rights as good—
       &nbspAnd very loud the shout was for that same
Motto, “Il popolo.” Il Popolo,—
       &nbspThe word means dukedom, empire, majesty,
And kings in such an hour might read it so.
       &nbspAnd next, with banners, each in his degree,
Deputed representatives a-row
       &nbspOf every separate state of Tuscany:
Siena’s she-wolf, bristling on the fold
       &nbspOf the first flag, preceded Pisa’s hare,
And Massa’s lion floated calm in gold,
       &nbspPienza’s following with his silver stare,
Arezzo’s steed pranced clear from bridle-hold,—
       &nbspAnd well might shout our Florence, greeting there
These, and more brethren. Last, the world had sent
       &nbspThe various children of her teeming flanks—
Greeks, English, French—as if to a parliament
       &nbspOf lovers of her Italy in ranks,
Each bearing its land’s symbol reverent;
       &nbspAt which the stones seemed breaking into thanks
And rattling up the sky, such sounds in proof
       &nbspArose; the very house-walls seemed to bend;
The very windows, up from door to roof,
       &nbspFlashed out a rapture of bright heads, to mend
With passionate looks the gesture’s whirling off
       &nbspA hurricane of leaves. Three hours did end
While all these passed; and ever in the crowd,
       &nbspRude men, unconscious of the tears that kept
Their beards moist, shouted; some few laughed aloud,
       &nbspAnd none asked any why they laughed and wept:
Friends kissed each other’s cheeks, and foes long vowed
       &nbspMore warmly did it; two-months’ babies leapt
Right upward in their mother’s arms, whose black
       &nbspWide glittering eyes looked elsewhere; lovers pressed
Each before either, neither glancing back;
       &nbspAnd peasant maidens smoothly ’tired and tressed
Forgot to finger on their throats the slack
       &nbspGreat pearl-strings; while old blind men would not rest,
But pattered with their staves and slid their shoes
       &nbspAlong the stones, and smiled as if they saw.
O heaven, I think that day had noble use
       &nbspAmong God’s days! So near stood Right and Law,
Both mutually forborne! Law would not bruise
       &nbspNor Right deny, and each in reverent awe
Honoured the other. And if, ne’ertheless,
       &nbspThat good day’s sun delivered to the vines
No charta, and the liberal Duke’s excess
       &nbspDid scarce exceed a Guelf’s or Ghibelline’s
In any special actual righteousness
       &nbspOf what that day he granted, still the signs
Are good and full of promise, we must say,
       &nbspWhen multitudes approach their kings with prayers
And kings concede their people’s right to pray
       &nbspBoth in one sunshine. Griefs are not despairs,
So uttered, nor can royal claims dismay
       &nbspWhen men from humble homes and ducal chairs
Hate wrong together. It was well to view
       &nbspThose banners ruffled in a ruler’s face
Inscribed, “Live freedom, union, and all true
       &nbspBrave patriots who are aided by God’s grace!”
Nor was it ill when Leopoldo drew
       &nbspHis little children to the window-place
He stood in at the Pitti, to suggest
       &nbspThey too should govern as the people willed.
What a cry rose then! some, who saw the best,
       &nbspDeclared his eyes filled up and overfilled
With good warm human tears which unrepressed
       &nbspRan down. I like his face; the forehead’s build
Has no capacious genius, yet perhaps
       &nbspSufficient comprehension,—mild and sad,
And careful nobly,—not with care that wraps
       &nbspSelf-loving hearts, to stifle and make mad,
But careful with the care that shuns a lapse
       &nbspOf faith and duty, studious not to add
A burden in the gathering of a gain.
       &nbspAnd so, God save the Duke, I say with those
Who that day shouted it; and while dukes reign,
       &nbspMay all wear in the visible overflows
Of spirit, such a look of careful pain!
       &nbspFor God must love it better than repose.


And all the people who went up to let
       &nbspTheir hearts out to that Duke, as has been told—
Where guess ye that the living people met,
       &nbspKept tryst, formed ranks, chose leaders, first unrolled
Their banners?


       &nbsp       &nbspIn the Loggia? where is set
Cellini’s godlike Perseus, bronze or gold,
       &nbsp(How name the metal, when the statue flings
Its soul so in your eyes?) with brow and sword
       &nbspSuperbly calm, as all opposing things,
Slain with the Gorgon, were no more abhorred
Since ended?

       &nbspNo, the people sought no wings
From Perseus in the Loggia, nor implored
       &nbspAn inspiration in the place beside
From that dim bust of Brutus, jagged and grand,
       &nbspWhere Buonarroti passionately tried
From out the close-clenched marble to demand
       &nbspThe head of Rome’s sublimest homicide,
Then dropt the quivering mallet from his hand,
       &nbspDespairing he could find no model-stuff
Of Brutus in all Florence where he found
       &nbspThe gods and gladiators thick enough.
Nor there! the people chose still holier ground:
       &nbspThe people, who are simple, blind and rough,
Know their own angels, after looking round.
Whom chose they then? where met they?


       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspOn the stone
Called Dante’s,—a plain flat stone scarce discerned
       &nbspFrom others in the pavement,—whereupon
He used to bring his quiet chair out, turned
       &nbspTo Brunelleschi’s church, and pour alone
The lava of his spirit when it burned:
       &nbspIt is not cold to-day. O passionate
Poor Dante who, a banished Florentine,
       &nbspDidst sit austere at banquets of the great
And muse upon this far-off stone of thine
       &nbspAnd think how oft some passer used to wait
A moment, in the golden day’s decline,
       &nbspWith “Good night, dearest Dante!”—well, good night!
I muse now, Dante, and think verily,
       &nbspThough chapelled in the byeway out of sight,
Ravenna’s bones would thrill with ecstasy,
       &nbspCouldst know thy favourite stone’s elected right
As tryst-place for thy Tuscans to foresee
       &nbspTheir earliest chartas from. Good night, good morn,
Henceforward, Dante! now my soul is sure
       &nbspThat thine is better comforted of scorn,
And looks down earthward in completer cure
       &nbspThan when, in Santa Croce church forlorn
Of any corpse, the architect and hewer
       &nbspDid pile the empty marbles as thy tomb.
For now thou art no longer exiled, now
       &nbspBest honoured: we salute thee who art come
Back to the old stone with a softer brow
       &nbspThan Giotto drew upon the wall, for some
Good lovers of our age to track and plough
       &nbspTheir way to, through time’s ordures stratified,
And startle broad awake into the dull
       &nbspBargello chamber: now thou’rt milder-eyed,—
Now Beatrix may leap up glad to cull
       &nbspThy first smile, even in heaven and at her side,
Like that which, nine years old, looked beautiful
       &nbspAt May-game. What do I say? I only meant
That tender Dante loved his Florence well,
       &nbspWhile Florence, now, to love him is content;
And, mark ye, that the piercingest sweet smell
       &nbspOf love’s dear incense by the living sent
To find the dead, is not accessible
       &nbspTo lazy livers—no narcotic,—not
Swung in a censer to a sleepy tune,—
       &nbspBut trod out in the morning air by hot
Quick spirits who tread firm to ends foreshown,
       &nbspAnd use the name of greatness unforgot,
To meditate what greatness may be done.


For Dante sits in heaven and ye stand here,
       &nbspAnd more remains for doing, all must feel,
Than trysting on his stone from year to year
       &nbspTo shift processions, civic toe to heel,
The town’s thanks to the Pitti. Are ye freer
       &nbspFor what was felt that day? a chariot-wheel
May spin fast, yet the chariot never roll.
       &nbspBut if that day suggested something good,
And bettered, with one purpose, soul by soul,—
       &nbspBetter means freer. A land’s brotherhood
Is most puissant: men, upon the whole,
       &nbspAre what they can be,—nations, what they would.


Will therefore, to be strong, thou Italy!
       &nbspWill to be noble! Austrian Metternich
Can fix no yoke unless the neck agree;
       &nbspAnd thine is like the lion’s when the thick
Dews shudder from it, and no man would be
       &nbspThe stroker of his mane, much less would prick
His nostril with a reed. When nations roar
       &nbspLike lions, who shall tame them and defraud
Of the due pasture by the river-shore?
       &nbspRoar, therefore! shake your dewlaps dry abroad:
The amphitheatre with open door
       &nbspLeads back upon the benches who applaud
The last spear-thruster.


Yet the Heavens forbid
       &nbspThat we should call on passion to confront
The brutal with the brutal and, amid
       &nbspThis ripening world, suggest a lion-hunt
And lion’s-vengeance for the wrongs men did
       &nbspAnd do now, though the spears are getting blunt.
We only call, because the sight and proof
       &nbspOf lion-strength hurts nothing; and to show
A lion-heart, and measure paw with hoof,
       &nbspHelps something, even, and will instruct a foe
As well as the onslaught, how to stand aloof:
       &nbspOr else the world gets past the mere brute blow
Or given or taken. Children use the fist
       &nbspUntil they are of age to use the brain;
And so we needed Cæsars to assist
       &nbspMan’s justice, and Napoleons to explain
God’s counsel, when a point was nearly missed,
       &nbspUntil our generations should attain
Christ’s stature nearer. Not that we, alas,
       &nbspAttain already; but a single inch
Will raise to look down on the swordsman’s pass.
       &nbspAs knightly Roland on the coward’s flinch:
And, after chloroform and ether-gas,
       &nbspWe find out slowly what the bee and finch
Have ready found, through Nature’s lamp in each,
       &nbspHow to our races we may justify
Our individual claims and, as we reach
       &nbspOur own grapes, bend the top vines to supply
The children’s uses,—how to fill a breach
       &nbspWith olive-branches,—how to quench a lie
With truth, and smite a foe upon the cheek
       &nbspWith Christ’s most conquering kiss. Why, these are things
Worth a great nation’s finding, to prove weak
       &nbspThe “glorious arms” of military kings.
And so with wide embrace, my England, seek
       &nbspTo stifle the bad heat and flickerings
Of this world’s false and nearly expended fire!
       &nbspDraw palpitating arrows to the wood,
And twang abroad thy high hopes and thy higher
       &nbspResolves, from that most virtuous altitude!
Till nations shall unconsciously aspire
       &nbspBy looking up to thee, and learn that good
And glory are not different. Announce law
       &nbspBy freedom; exalt chivalry by peace;
Instruct how clear calm eyes can overawe,
       &nbspAnd how pure hands, stretched simply to release
A bond-slave, will not need a sword to draw
       &nbspTo be held dreadful. O my England, crease
Thy purple with no alien agonies,
       &nbspNo struggles toward encroachment, no vile war!
Disband thy captains, change thy victories,
       &nbspBe henceforth prosperous as the angels are,
Helping, not humbling.


       &nbsp       &nbspDrums and battle-cries
Go out in music of the morning-star—
       &nbspAnd soon we shall have thinkers in the place
Of fighters, each found able as a man
       &nbspTo strike electric influence through a race,
Unstayed by city-wall and barbican.
       &nbspThe poet shall look grander in the face
Than even of old (when he of Greece began
       &nbspTo sing “that Achillean wrath which slew
So many heroes”)—seeing he shall treat
       &nbspThe deeds of souls heroic toward the true,
The oracles of life, previsions sweet
       &nbspAnd awful like divine swans gliding through
White arms of Ledas, which will leave the heat
       &nbspOf their escaping godship to endue
The human medium with a heavenly flush.


Meanwhile, in this same Italy we want
       &nbspNot popular passion, to arise and crush,
But popular conscience, which may covenant
       &nbspFor what it knows. Concede without a blush,
To grant the “civic guard” is not to grant
       &nbspThe civic spirit, living and awake:
Those lappets on your shoulders, citizens,
       &nbspYour eyes strain after sideways till they ache
(While still, in admirations and amens,
       &nbspThe crowd comes up on festa-days to take
The great sight in)—are not intelligence,
       &nbspNot courage even—alas, if not the sign
Of something very noble, they are nought;
       &nbspFor every day ye dress your sallow kine
With fringes down their cheeks, though unbesought
       &nbspThey loll their heavy heads and drag the wine
And bear the wooden yoke as they were taught
       &nbspThe first day. What ye want is light—indeed
Not sunlight—(ye may well look up surprised
       &nbspTo those unfathomable heavens that feed
Your purple hills)—but God’s light organized
       &nbspIn some high soul, crowned capable to lead
The conscious people, conscious and advised,—
       &nbspFor if we lift a people like mere clay,
It falls the same. We want thee, O unfound
       &nbspAnd sovran teacher! if thy beard be grey
Or black, we bid thee rise up from the ground
       &nbspAnd speak the word God giveth thee to say,
Inspiring into all this people round,
       &nbspInstead of passion, thought, which pioneers
All generous passion, purifies from sin,
       &nbspAnd strikes the hour for. Rise up, teacher! here’s
A crowd to make a nation!—best begin
       &nbspBy making each a man, till all be peers
Of earth’s true patriots and pure martyrs in
       &nbspKnowing and daring. Best unbar the doors
Which Peter’s heirs keep locked so overclose
       &nbspThey only let the mice across the floors,
While every churchman dangles, as he goes,
       &nbspThe great key at his girdle, and abhors
In Christ’s name, meekly. Open wide the house,
       &nbspConcede the entrance with Christ’s liberal mind,
And set the tables with His wine and bread.
       &nbspWhat! “commune in both kinds?” In every kind—
Wine, wafer, love, hope, truth, unlimited,
       &nbspNothing kept back. For when a man is blind
To starlight, will he see the rose is red?
       &nbspA bondsman shivering at a Jesuit’s foot—
“Væ! meâ culpâ!”—is not like to stand
       &nbspA freedman at a despot’s and dispute
His titles by the balance in his hand,
       &nbspWeighing them “suo jure.” Tend the root
If careful of the branches, and expand
       &nbspThe inner souls of men before you strive
For civic heroes.


       &nbsp       &nbspBut the teacher, where?
From all these crowded faces, all alive,
       &nbspEyes, of their own lids flashing themselves bare,
And brows that with a mobile life contrive
       &nbspA deeper shadow,—may we in no wise dare
To put a finger out and touch a man,
       &nbspAnd cry “this is the leader”? What, all these!
Broad heads, black eyes,—yet not a soul that ran
       &nbspFrom God down with a message? All, to please
The donna waving measures with her fan,
       &nbspAnd not the judgment-angel on his knees
(The trumpet just an inch off from his lips),
       &nbspWho when he breathes next, will put out the sun?


Yet mankind’s self were foundered in eclipse,
       &nbspIf lacking doers, with great works to be done;
And lo, the startled earth already dips
       &nbspBack into light; a better day’s begun;
And soon this leader, teacher, will stand plain,
       &nbspAnd build the golden pipes and synthesize
This people-organ for a holy strain.
       &nbspWe hold this hope, and still in all these eyes
Go sounding for the deep look which shall drain
       &nbspSuffused thought into channelled enterprise.
Where is the teacher? What now may he do,
       &nbspWho shall do greatly? Doth he gird his waist
With a monk’s rope, like Luther? or pursue
       &nbspThe goat, like Tell? or dry his nets in haste,
Like Masaniello when the sky was blue?
       &nbspKeep house, like other peasants, with inlaced
Bare brawny arms about a favourite child,
       &nbspAnd meditative looks beyond the door
(But not to mark the kidling’s teeth have filed
T       &nbsphe green shoots of his vine which last year bore
Full twenty bunches), or, on triple-piled
       &nbspThrone-velvets sit at ease to bless the poor,
Like other pontiffs, in the Poorest’s name?
       &nbspThe old tiara keeps itself aslope
Upon his steady brows which, all the same,
       &nbspBend mildly to permit the people’s hope?

Whatever hand shall grasp this oriflamme,
       &nbspWhatever man (last peasant or first pope
Seeking to free his country) shall appear,
       &nbspTeach, lead, strike fire into the masses, fill
These empty bladders with fine air, insphere
       &nbspThese wills into a unity of will,
And make of Italy a nation—dear
       &nbspAnd blessed be that man! the Heavens shall kill
No leaf the earth lets grow for him, and Death
       &nbspShall cast him back upon the lap of Life
To live more surely, in a clarion-breath
       &nbspOf hero-music. Brutus with the knife,
Rienzi with the fasces, throb beneath
       &nbspRome’s stones,—and more who threw away joy’s fife
Like Pallas, that the beauty of their souls
       &nbspMight ever shine untroubled and entire:
But if it can be true that he who rolls
       &nbspThe Church’s thunders will reserve her fire
For only light,—from eucharistic bowls
       &nbspWill pour new life for nations that expire,
And rend the scarlet of his papal vest
       &nbspTo gird the weak loins of his countrymen,—
I hold that he surpasses all the rest
       &nbspOf Romans, heroes, patriots; and that when
He sat down on the throne, he dispossessed
       &nbspThe first graves of some glory. See again,
This country-saving is a glorious thing:
       &nbspAnd if a common man achieved it? well.
Say, a rich man did? excellent. A king?
       &nbspThat grows sublime. A priest? improbable.
A pope? Ah, there we stop, and cannot bring
       &nbspOur faith up to the leap, with history’s bell
So heavy round the neck of it—albeit
       &nbspWe fain would grant the possibility
For thy sake, Pio Nono!


       &nbsp       &nbspStretch thy feet
In that case—I will kiss them reverently
       &nbspAs any pilgrim to the papal seat:
And, such proved possible, thy throne to me
       &nbspShall seem as holy a place as Pellico’s
Venetian dungeon, or as Spielberg’s grate
       &nbspAt which the Lombard woman hung the rose
Of her sweet soul by its own dewy weight,
       &nbspTo feel the dungeon round her sunshine close,
And pining so, died early, yet too late
       &nbspFor what she suffered. Yea, I will not choose
Betwixt thy throne, Pope Pius, and the spot
       &nbspMarked red for ever, spite of rains and dews,
Where Two fell riddled by the Austrian’s shot,
       &nbspThe brothers Bandiera, who accuse,
With one same mother-voice and face (that what
       &nbspThey speak may be invincible) the sins
Of earth’s tormentors before God the just,
       &nbspUntil the unconscious thunderbolt begins
To loosen in His grasp.


       &nbsp       &nbspAnd yet we must
Beware, and mark the natural kiths and kins
       &nbspOf circumstance and office, and distrust
The rich man reasoning in a poor man’s hut,
       &nbspThe poet who neglects pure truth to prove
Statistic fact, the child who leaves a rut
       &nbspFor a smoother road, the priest who vows his glove
Exhales no grace, the prince who walks afoot,
       &nbspThe woman who has sworn she will not love,
And this Ninth Pius in Seventh Gregory’s chair,
       &nbspWith Andrea Doria’s forehead!

       &nbsp       &nbspCount what goes
To making up a pope, before he wear
       &nbspThat triple crown. We pass the world-wide throes
Which went to make the popedom,—the despair
       &nbspOf free men, good men, wise men; the dread shows
Of women’s faces, by the faggot’s flash
       &nbspTossed out, to the minutest stir and throb
O’ the white lips, the least tremble of a lash,
       &nbspTo glut the red stare of a licensed mob;
The short mad cries down oubliettes, and plash
       &nbspSo horribly far off; priests, trained to rob,
And kings that, like encouraged nightmares, sat
       &nbspOn nations’ hearts most heavily distressed
With monstrous sights and apophthegms of fate—
       &nbspWe pass these things,—because “the times” are prest
With necessary charges of the weight
       &nbspOf all this sin, and “Calvin, for the rest,
Made bold to burn Servetus. Ah, men err!”—
       &nbspAnd so do churches! which is all we mean
To bring to proof in any register
       &nbspOf theological fat kine and lean:
So drive them back into the pens! refer
       &nbspOld sins (with pourpoint, “quotha” and “I ween”)
Entirely to the old times, the old times;
       &nbspNor ever ask why this preponderant
Infallible pure Church could set her chimes
       &nbspMost loudly then, just then,—most jubilant,
Precisely then, when mankind stood in crimes
       &nbspFull heart-deep, and Heaven’s judgments were not scant.
Inquire still less, what signifies a church
       &nbspOf perfect inspiration and pure laws
Who burns the first man with a brimstone-torch,
       &nbspAnd grinds the second, bone by bone, because
The times, forsooth, are used to rack and scorch!
       &nbspWhat is a holy Church unless she awes
The times down from their sins? Did Christ select
       &nbspSuch amiable times to come and teach
Love to, and mercy? The whole world were wrecked
       &nbspIf every mere great man, who lives to reach
A little leaf of popular respect,
       &nbspAttained not simply by some special breach
In the age’s customs, by some precedence
       &nbspIn thought and act, which, having proved him higher
Than those he lived with, proved his competence
       &nbspIn helping them to wonder and aspire.


My words are guiltless of the bigot’s sense;
       &nbspMy soul has fire to mingle with the fire
Of all these souls, within or out of doors
       &nbspOf Rome’s church or another. I believe
In one Priest, and one temple with its floors
       &nbspOf shining jasper gloom’d at morn and eve
By countless knees of earnest auditors,
       &nbspAnd crystal walls too lucid to perceive,
That none may take the measure of the place
       &nbspAnd say “So far the porphyry, then, the flint—
To this mark mercy goes, and there ends grace,”
       &nbspThough still the permeable crystals hint
At some white starry distance, bathed in space.
       &nbspI feel how nature’s ice-crusts keep the dint
Of undersprings of silent Deity.
       &nbspI hold the articulated gospels which
Show Christ among us crucified on tree.
       &nbspI love all who love truth, if poor or rich
In what they have won of truth possessively.
       &nbspNo altars and no hands defiled with pitch
Shall scare me off, but I will pray and eat
       &nbspWith all these—taking leave to choose my ewers—
And say at last “Your visible churches cheat
       &nbspTheir inward types; and, if a church assures
Of standing without failure and defeat,
       &nbspThe same both fails and lies.”


       &nbsp       &nbspTo leave which lures
Of wider subject through past years,—behold,
       &nbspWe come back from the popedom to the pope,
To ponder what he must be, ere we are bold
       &nbspFor what he may be, with our heavy hope
To trust upon his soul. So, fold by fold,
       &nbspExplore this mummy in the priestly cope,
Transmitted through the darks of time, to catch
       &nbspThe man within the wrappage, and discern
How he, an honest man, upon the watch
       &nbspFull fifty years for what a man may learn,
Contrived to get just there; with what a snatch
       &nbspOf old-world oboli he had to earn
The passage through; with what a drowsy sop,
       &nbspTo drench the busy barkings of his brain;
What ghosts of pale tradition, wreathed with hop
       &nbsp’Gainst wakeful thought, he had to entertain
For heavenly visions; and consent to stop
       &nbspThe clock at noon, and let the hour remain
(Without vain windings-up) inviolate
       &nbspAgainst all chimings from the belfry. Lo,
From every given pope you must abate,
       &nbspAlbeit you love him, some things—good, you know—
Which every given heretic you hate,
       &nbspAssumes for his, as being plainly so.
A pope must hold by popes a little,—yes,
       &nbspBy councils, from Nicæa up to Trent,—
By hierocratic empire, more or less
       &nbspIrresponsible to men,—he must resent
Each man’s particular conscience, and repress
       &nbspInquiry, meditation, argument,
As tyrants faction. Also, he must not
       &nbspLove truth too dangerously, but prefer
“The interests of the Church” (because a blot
       &nbspIs better than a rent, in miniver)—
Submit to see the people swallow hot
       &nbspHusk-porridge, which his chartered churchmen stir
Quoting the only true God’s epigraph,
       &nbsp“Feed my lambs, Peter!”—must consent to sit
Attesting with his pastoral ring and staff
       &nbspTo such a picture of our Lady, hit
Off well by artist-angels (though not half
       &nbspAs fair as Giotto would have painted it)—
To such a vial, where a dead man’s blood
       &nbspRuns yearly warm beneath a churchman’s finger,—
To such a holy house of stone and wood,
       &nbspWhereof a cloud of angels was the bringer
From Bethlehem to Loreto. Were it good
       &nbspFor any pope on earth to be a flinger
Of stones against these high-niched counterfeits?
       &nbspApostates only are iconoclasts.
He dares not say, while this false thing abets
       &nbspThat true thing, “This is false.” He keeps his fasts
And prayers, as prayer and fast were silver frets
       &nbspTo change a note upon a string that lasts,
And make a lie a virtue. Now, if he
       &nbspDid more than this, higher hoped, and braver dared,
I think he were a pope in jeopardy,
       &nbspOr no pope rather, for his truth had barred
The vaulting of his life,—and certainly,
       &nbspIf he do only this, mankind’s regard
Moves on from him at once, to seek some new
       &nbspTeacher and leader. He is good and great
According to the deeds a pope can do;
       &nbspMost liberal, save those bonds; affectionate,
As princes may be, and, as priests are, true;
       &nbspBut only the Ninth Pius after eight,
When all’s praised most. At best and hopefullest,
       &nbspHe’s pope—we want a man! his heart beats warm,
But, like the prince enchanted to the waist,
       &nbspHe sits in stone and hardens by a charm
Into the marble of his throne high-placed.
       &nbspMild benediction waves his saintly arm—
So, good! but what we want’s a perfect man,
       &nbspComplete and all alive: half travertine
Half suits our need, and ill subserves our plan.
       &nbspFeet, knees, nerves, sinews, energies divine
Were never yet too much for men who ran
       &nbspIn such hard ways as must be this of thine,
Deliverer whom we seek, whoe’er thou art,
       &nbspPope, prince, or peasant! If, indeed, the first,
The noblest, therefore! since the heroic heart
       &nbspWithin thee must be great enough to burst
Those trammels buckling to the baser part
       &nbspThy saintly peers in Rome, who crossed and cursed
With the same finger.



       &nbsp       &nbspCome, appear, be found,
If pope or peasant, come! we hear the cock,
       &nbspThe courtier of the mountains when first crowned
With golden dawn; and orient glories flock
       &nbspTo meet the sun upon the highest ground.
Take voice and work! we wait to hear thee knock
       &nbspAt some one of our Florentine nine gates,
On each of which was imaged a sublime
       &nbspFace of a Tuscan genius, which, for hate’s
And love’s sake, both, our Florence in her prime
       &nbspTurned boldly on all comers to her states,
As heroes turned their shields in antique time
       &nbspEmblazoned with honourable acts. And though
The gates are blank now of such images,
       &nbspAnd Petrarch looks no more from Nicolo
Toward dear Arezzo, ’twixt the acacia-trees,
N       &nbspor Dante, from gate Gallo—still we know,
Despite the razing of the blazonries,
       &nbspRemains the consecration of the shield:
The dead heroic faces will start out
       &nbspOn all these gates, if foes should take the field,
And blend sublimely, at the earliest shout,
       &nbspWith living heroes who will scorn to yield
A hair’s-breadth even, when, gazing round about,
       &nbspThey find in what a glorious company
They fight the foes of Florence. Who will grudge
       &nbspHis one poor life, when that great man we see
Has given five hundred years, the world being judge,
       &nbspTo help the glory of his Italy?
Who, born the fair side of the Alps, will budge,
       &nbspWhen Dante stays, when Ariosto stays,
When Petrarch stays for ever? Ye bring swords,
       &nbspMy Tuscans? Ay, if wanted in this haze,
Bring swords: but first bring souls!—bring thoughts and words,
       &nbspUnrusted by a tear of yesterday’s,
Yet awful by its wrong,—and cut these cords,
       &nbspAnd mow this green lush falseness to the roots,
And shut the mouth of hell below the swathe!
       &nbspAnd, if ye can bring songs too, let the lute’s
Recoverable music softly bathe
       &nbspSome poet’s hand, that, through all bursts and bruits
Of popular passion, all unripe and rathe
       &nbspConvictions of the popular intellect,
Ye may not lack a finger up the air,
       &nbspAnnunciative, reproving, pure, erect,
To show which way your first Ideal bare
       &nbspThe whiteness of its wings when (sorely pecked
By falcons on your wrists) it unaware
       &nbspArose up overhead and out of sight.


Meanwhile, let all the far ends of the world
       &nbspBreathe back the deep breath of their old delight,
To swell the Italian banner just unfurled.
       &nbspHelp, lands of Europe! for, if Austria fight,
The drums will bar your slumber. Had ye curled
       &nbspThe laurel for your thousand artists’ brows,
If these Italian hands had planted none?
       &nbspCan any sit down idle in the house
Nor hear appeals from Buonarroti’s stone
       &nbspAnd Raffael’s canvas, rousing and to rouse?
Where’s Poussin’s master? Gallic Avignon
Bred Laura, and Vaucluse’s fount has stirred
       &nbspThe heart of France too strongly, as it lets
Its little stream out (like a wizard’s bird
       &nbspWhich bounds upon its emerald wing and wets
The rocks on each side), that she should not gird
       &nbspHer loins with Charlemagne’s sword when foes beset
The country of her Petrarch. Spain may well
       &nbspBe minded how from Italy she caught,
To mingle with her tinkling Moorish bell,
       &nbspA fuller cadence and a subtler thought.
And even the New World, the receptacle
       &nbspOf freemen, may send glad men, as it ought,
To greet Vespucci Amerigo’s door.
       &nbspWhile England claims, by trump of poetry,
Verona, Venice, the Ravenna-shore,
       &nbspAnd dearer holds John Milton’s Fiesole
Than Langland’s Malvern with the stars in flower.


And Vallombrosa, we two went to see
       &nbspLast June, beloved companion,—where sublime
The mountains live in holy families,
       &nbspAnd the slow pinewoods ever climb and climb
Half up their breasts, just stagger as they seize
       &nbspSome grey crag, drop back with it many a time,
And straggle blindly down the precipice.
       &nbspThe Vallombrosan brooks were strewn as thick
That June-day, knee-deep with dead beechen leaves,
       &nbspAs Milton saw them ere his heart grew sick
And his eyes blind. I think the monks and beeves
       &nbspAre all the same too: scarce have they changed the wick
On good Saint Gualbert’s altar which receives
       &nbspThe convent’s pilgrims; and the pool in front
(Wherein the hill-stream trout are cast, to wait
       &nbspThe beatific vision and the grunt
Used at refectory) keeps its weedy state,
       &nbspTo baffle saintly abbots who would count
The fish across their breviary nor ’bate
       &nbspThe measure of their steps. O waterfalls
And forests! sound and silence! mountains bare
       &nbspThat leap up peak by peak and catch the palls
Of purple and silver mist to rend and share
       &nbspWith one another, at electric calls
Of life in the sunbeams,—till we cannot dare
       &nbspFix your shapes, count your number! we must think
Your beauty and your glory helped to fill
       &nbspThe cup of Milton’s soul so to the brink,
He never more was thirsty when God’s will
       &nbspHad shattered to his sense the last chain-link
By which he had drawn from Nature’s visible
       &nbspThe fresh well-water. Satisfied by this,
He sang of Adam’s paradise and smiled,
       &nbspRemembering Vallombrosa. Therefore is
The place divine to English man and child,
And pilgrims leave their souls here in a kiss.


For Italy’s the whole earth’s treasury, piled
       &nbspWith reveries of gentle ladies, flung
Aside, like ravelled silk, from life’s worn stuff;
       &nbspWith coins of scholars’ fancy, which, being rung
On work-day counter, still sound silver-proof;
       &nbspIn short, with all the dreams of dreamers young,
Before their heads have time for slipping off
       &nbspHope’s pillow to the ground. How oft, indeed,
We’ve sent our souls out from the rigid north,
       &nbspOn bare white feet which would not print nor bleed,
To climb the Alpine passes and look forth,
       &nbspWhere booming low the Lombard rivers lead
To gardens, vineyards, all a dream is worth,—
       &nbspSights, thou and I, Love, have seen afterward
From Tuscan Bellosguardo, wide awake,
       &nbspWhen, standing on the actual blessed sward
Where Galileo stood at nights to take
       &nbspThe vision of the stars, we have found it hard,
Gazing upon the earth and heaven, to make
A choice of beauty.


       &nbsp       &nbspTherefore let us all
Refreshed in England or in other land,
       &nbspBy visions, with their fountain-rise and fall,
Of this earth’s darling,—we, who understand
       &nbspA little how the Tuscan musical
Vowels do round themselves as if they planned
       &nbspEternities of separate sweetness,—we,
Who loved Sorrento vines in picture-book,
       &nbspOr ere in wine-cup we pledged faith or glee,—
Who loved Rome’s wolf with demi-gods at suck,
       &nbspOr ere we loved truth’s own divinity,—
Who loved, in brief, the classic hill and brook,
       &nbspAnd Ovid’s dreaming tales and Petrarch’s song,
Or ere we loved Love’s self even,—let us give
       &nbspThe blessing of our souls (and wish them strong
To bear it to the height where prayers arrive,
       &nbspWhen faithful spirits pray against a wrong,)
To this great cause of southern men who strive
       &nbspIn God’s name for man’s rights, and shall not fail.


Behold, they shall not fail. The shouts ascend
       &nbspAbove the shrieks, in Naples, and prevail.
Rows of shot corpses, waiting for the end
       &nbspOf burial, seem to smile up straight and pale
Into the azure air and apprehend
       &nbspThat final gun-flash from Palermo’s coast
Which lightens their apocalypse of death.
       &nbspSo let them die! The world shows nothing lost;
Therefore, not blood. Above or underneath,
       &nbspWhat matter, brothers, if ye keep your post
On duty’s side? As sword returns to sheath,
       &nbspSo dust to grave, but souls find place in Heaven.
Heroic daring is the true success,
       &nbspThe eucharistic bread requires no leaven;
And though your ends were hopeless, we should bless
       &nbspYour cause as holy. Strive—and, having striven,
Take, for God’s recompense, that righteousness!Embed Incy Wincy Spider 50 Silly Songs The Little Sunshine Kids children
