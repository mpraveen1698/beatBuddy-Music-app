26 ContributorsOne Lyrics[Verse 1]
Affirmative may be justified
Take from one, give to another
The goal is to be unified
Take my hand, be my brother
The payment silenced the masses
Sanctified by oppression
Unity took a back seat
Sliding further into regression

[Pre-Chorus]
One, oh, one, the only way is one
One, oh, one, the only way is one

[Chorus]
I feel angry, I feel helpless
Want to change the world, yeah
I feel violent, I feel alone
Don't try and change my mind, no

[Verse 2]
Society, blind by color
Why hold down one to raise another?
Discrimination, now on both sides
Seeds of hate blossom further
The world is headed for mutiny
When all we want is unity
We may rise and fall
But in the end, we'll meet our fate again, oh

One, oh, one, the only way is one

[Chorus]
I feel angry, I feel helpless
Want to change the world, yeah
I feel violent, I feel alone
Don't try and change my mind, no
I feel angry, I feel helpless
Want to change the world, yeah
I feel violent, I feel alone
Don't try and change my mind, no
I feel angry, I feel helpless
Want to change the world, yeah
I feel violent, I feel alone
Don't try and change my mind, no
I feel angry, I feel helpless
Want to change the world, yeah
I feel violent, I feel alone
Don't try and change my mind, no1Embed One My Own Prison Creed grunge
