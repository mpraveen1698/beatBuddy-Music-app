If I, I get to know your name
Well if I, could trace your private number, baby

[Refrain]
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
I want some, want some

[Verse 2]
I set my sights on you
(And no one else will do)
And I, I've got to have my way now, baby

[Refrain]
All I know is that to me
You look like you're havin' fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come

[Chorus]
You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round
You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round
