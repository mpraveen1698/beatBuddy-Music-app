Uh
BTS
Chun-Li

[Verse 1: RM, j-hope]
You can call me artist (Artists)
You can call me idol (Idol)
Or any other something you come up with
I don't care
I'm proud of it (proud of it)
I'm free (free)
No more irony (irony)
For I was always myself

[Verse 2: SUGA, RM]
Point your fingers, I couldn't care less
No matter what your reason to blame me is
I know what I am (I know what I am)
I know what I want (I know what I want)
I never gon' change (I never gon' change)
I never gon' trade
(Trade off)

[Pre-Chorus: V, RM, Jimin]
What you keep babbling about
(Talkin', talkin', talkin')
I do what I do, so mind your own business

You can't stop me lovin' myself

[Verse 3: j-hope, SUGA]
FACE OFF, just like John Woo, ay
Top star with that spotlight, ay
Sometimes become a superhero
Spin it your Anpanman
Woah, 24 hours isn't enough
Can’t afford to be confused (Woah)
I do my thang (I do my thang)
I love myself
[Verse 4: Jung Kook, V]
I love myself (I love myself), I love my fans
Love my dance, and my what
There are tens and hundreds of myself in me
I welcome another me today
After all, all of them is me
I just go at it rather than to sit on it
Runnin' man
Runnin' man
Runnin' man
(Brrrra!)

[Bridge: Jimin, Jung Kook, Jin]
I'm so fine wherever I go (Go, go, go, go)
Sometimes I find the longest way to go around, oh
It's okay, I'm in love with my-my myself
It's okay, I'm happy in this moment

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Uh! What's good, Korea?
You know I've been a boss for my whole career
I'm 'bout to Jet in the lear
And put more than my hands in the air
Hands in the air, put your hands in the air
If you getting money, rubber bands in the air
Never gave an eff, they can cancel my care
'Cause if he look good, throw my pants in the air
I'm here word to John Mayer
My body's a wonderland, my face is top tier
I swear watch the ice glare
They be like I'm Gucci but don't shop there
One time, press rewind
Tryna come up off Nicki name press decline
So much power in the mind, yes divine
Take your change you'll never be next in line (Oh!)

[Chorus: Jimin, j-hope]
You can't stop me lovin' myself
(Hoo hoo) Ursoo it's awesome
You can't stop me lovin' myself
(Hoo hoo) Hooray it's so awesome
You can't stop me lovin' myself

[Post-Chorus: All, Jung Kook]
Oh-oh-owoah (Hey)
Oh-oh-owoah-owoah
Oh-oh-owoah
Bum badum bum brrrrumble
Ursoo
Oh-oh-owoah (Hey)
