I'd like to say I'm okay, but I'm not
I try, but I fall
Close my mind, turn it off

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't be sober, I cannot sleep
You've got your peace now, but what about me?

[Chorus]
Thought we had the time, had our lives
Now you'll never get older, older
Didn't say goodbye, now I'm frozen in time
Gettin' colder, colder
One last word, one last moment
To ask you why you left me here behind
You said you'd grow old with me

[Verse 2]
We had plans, we had visions
Now I can't see ahead
We were one, we were golden
Forever, you said

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't be sober, I cannot sleep
You've got your peace now, but what about me?

Gettin' colder, colder
One last word, one last moment
To ask you why you left me here behind
You said you'd grow old with me

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ooh-ah

[Chorus]
Thought we had the time, had our lives
Now you'll never get older, older
Didn't say goodbye, now I'm frozen in time
Gettin' colder, colder
Just one last word, one last moment
To ask you why you left me here behind
