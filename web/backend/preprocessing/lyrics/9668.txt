[Verse 1]
I woke the same as any other day
Except a voice was in my head
It said, "Seize the day, pull the trigger
Drop the blade and watch the rolling heads"
The day I tried to live
I stole a thousand beggars' change
And gave it to the rich, yeah
The day I tried to win
I dangled from the power lines
And let the martyrs stretch, yeah

[Chorus]
Singing, one more time around (Might do it)
One more time around (Might make it)
One more time around (Might do it)
One more time around (I might make it)
The day I tried to live, yeah

[Verse 2]
The words you say
Never seem to live up to the ones inside your head
The lives we make
Never seem to ever get us anywhere but dead
The day I tried to live
I wallowed in the blood and mud
With all the other pigs, yeah

Singing, one more time around (Might do it)
One more time around (Might make it)
One more time around (Might do it)
One more time around (I might make it)
The day I tried to live, yeah
I tried

[Verse 3]
I woke the same as any other day
You know, I should have stayed in bed, yeah
The day I tried to win
I wallowed in the blood and mud
With all the other pigs

[Bridge]
And I learned that I was a liar (One more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (One more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (One more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (One more time around)

[Chorus]
Singing, one more time around (Might do it)
One more time around (Might make it)
One more time around (Might do it)
One more time around (I might make it)
The day I tried to live, yeah
[Outro]
Just like you
Just like you
One more time around
