6 ContributorsWithout Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
How did we let it all come to nothing
Feelin' like I should've been feelin' something
Lately I've been puttin' it off to see if
You'd come back crawling
The floor is falling out

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't you hold me if you don't wanna know me
Don't you play dumb when I see what you run from
So don't you leave me empty when it's only in my eyes

[Chorus]
How do you feel the same without me?
How do you feel the same when I don't sleep?
Somehow found me but you still doubt me
How do you feel the same without me?

[Verse 2]
Call me when you know that you're feelin' lovesick
Or you can call it off when you see that I ain't shit
Lately I been puttin' it off to see you
Don't come back crawling
The floor is falling out

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you hold me if you don't wanna know me
Don't you play dumb

How do you feel the same without me?
How do you feel the same when I don't sleep?
Somehow found me but you still doubt me
How do you feel the same without me?

[Bridge]
So don't you hold me if you don't wanna know me
So don't you leave me empty when it's only in my eyes

[Chorus]
How do you feel the same without me?
How do you feel the same when I don't sleep?
Somehow found me but you still doubt me
How do you feel the same without me?

[Outro]
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
