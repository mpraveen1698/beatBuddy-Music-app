Can I tell you a story
About a boy who broke his own heart?
And he always blamed everybody else
But the truth is that he did it to himself
Made a couple songs and they got big
And thought that he could do whatever he wanted
But it all left him with a hole in his heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Money buys you happiness
But, ooh-ooh-ooh
Doesn't buy you time

[Chorus]
The more that I get older
The less I wanna be sober
And I can't quit, goddamn it
And maybe I'm just broken
And I'll never admit it
But I wish that I was younger
Yeah, twenty-six and rich
How the hell did it come to this?

[Verse 2]
And I wish I could tell you
That everything is perfect, but it's not
I was staring at the ceiling for, like, ten days
But I'm pretty sure that I forgot
What it's like to be a person that doesn't think
That everything he does just sucks
Oh, it's a perfect world until it's not

Money buys you happiness
But, ooh-ooh-ooh
Doesn't buy you time

[Chorus]
The more that I get older
The less I wanna be sober
And I can't quit, goddamn it
And maybe I'm just broken
And I'll never admit it
But I wish that I was younger
Yeah, twenty-six and rich
How the hell did it come to this?

[Outro]
The more that I get older
The less I wanna be sober
Yeah, twenty-six and rich
How the hell did it come to this?1Embed 26 All 4 Nothing Lauv electro
