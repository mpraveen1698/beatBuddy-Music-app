1 ContributorHot Nigga (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: M.A.L.C.]
Niggas Thinking
Everything Is Always So Sweet

Fuck Around And Leave
A Nigga Laying In The Street

If You Think Your Style Sick
You Know I Got That Vaccine

Ma I'll Have Yo Child Hit
Now Tell Em Stop Playing With Me

When I See Her Its On Sight
Tom And Jerry Style

Ima Dog, In That Pussy
Have Her Yelling Hella Loud

Out Her Mouth, Talking Bout
On How I Blew Her Back Out

Telling All Her Bitches
Bout Our Business
Like A Snitching Mouse
You might also likeWoke Up From A Dream
I Was Inside A Rover Swervin

Realizing Everything In My Life
Was Ever So Perfect

Til I Came To Grip And Realized
I’m Really Starving And Hurting

So I Gotta Get That Money
Become Richer Than Birkin

When They Doubt On Me, Telling Me
Nothing In Life Is For Certain

I Tell Em Get The Fuck, Fo I Buck
Really Close Curtains

My Shawdy Don't Like When
I Get Aggressive, She Get Nervous

But She Still Goin Give Me Head
Fo I Jet On Some Sucking Service

Excuse Me, Mind My Manners
I Act Like A Fool On Purpose
Yes I Keep A Sense of Humor
I Am The Truth While She Slurpin'

We Should Keep That Under Wraps Like A
Taliban Turban

Others Say Hustle Better But
I Know They Purpin’

Niggas Thinking Everything
Is Always So Sweet

But They Know
They Ain't Fuckin' Wit' M.A.L.C.,

If A Hoe Start Charging More
Then I'ma Cancel The Subscription

Mind On My Business
I Ain't Worried Bout No Bitches

6ix Copped A Cuban Link
He Tryna Rock It Wit' The Pendant

Bitch You Know We Clean Up Nice
And Fuck A Budget We Big Spending
Ain't No Point In Doing This
If There’s Nothing In What You’re Risking

I Had to Switch My Style Up A Lil Bit
And Just Be Different

I'm A Quintessential Artist, Regardless
I Am The Smartest

Even Though I’m A Bit Heartless
My Passion For This Won't Tarnish

Still I Will Not Hesitate to Leave Someone
Laid on The Carpet

When My Patience Running Thin
Be Aware of The Shit You Starting

Best That I Take Precautions
I'm Facing A Couple Losses

Back When I Fell Apart
People Round Me Had Become Bosses

I Was Always The Loner
The One That They Disregarded
