[Verse 1]
Don't hear, don't deem
Drown in before you dive
Don't care, commit
To your self destruction drive

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I kiss the ground
With love beyond forever
Flip off the sky
With bleeding fingers till I die

[Instrumental Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Enemy, take a one good look at me
Eradicate what you will always be
Your tainted flesh, polluted soul
Through a mirror I behold
Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore
Should I regret or ask myself
Are you dead yet?
You might also like[Verse 3]
Wake up, don't cry
Regenerate to deny
The truth, the fiction
You live in blindfold on your eyes

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 4]
Disclosure, self loathing
This time you've gone too far
Or could it be
My nemesis that you 're me?

[Chorus]
Enemy, take a one good look at me
Eradicate what you will always be
Your tainted flesh, polluted soul
Through a mirror I behold
Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore
Should I regret or ask myself
Are you dead yet?
[Pre-Solo]
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Enemy, take a one good look at me
Eradicate what you will always be
Your tainted flesh, polluted soul
Through a mirror I behold
Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore
Should I regret or ask myself
Are you dead yet?
