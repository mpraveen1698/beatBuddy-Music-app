[Intro: brb.]
One time, yeah
Oh-ooh
You know what about it
Yeah, you got me
Let's talk about your love (uh)

[Verse 1: brb.]
Tell me that you noticed
Got me getting roses
Tryna make it something, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Got me down on Friday
Now I'm up on Sunday
I'm already missing ya (Missing ya)
Girl, you'd be my antidote (Antidote)
Get closer what you're waiting for (Girl, what you're waiting for)
We could do it on the bedroom floor
There's something 'bout your love

[Pre-Chorus: brb.]
Your love, your love, mm yeah, you got me
Your love, your love, mm yeah, you got me
Your love, your love, your love, you got me
Something about your love

Cut me open, I be coming back for more
Copped a Birkin she workin' never keeping score
Body perfect, I'll drink you like a chemical
Something 'bout your love
Ain't no issues, blame it on the alcohol
I been hurting all week but I take the fall
Love the you move and you got me good
There's something 'bout your love (Yeah, yeah, aye)

[Verse 2: Jimmy Brown]
Baby, you got a lot up on your mind (On your mind)
Baby, you know I'll be on your side (Yeah)
쉿 if you give me one sign
바로 날아가 비행기 안
열을식힌다음 휴식을새긴밤 (밤)
Baby, I know what you like
You get a tongue-tied (Tongue-tied)
We in this for life, we in this for life
There's something 'bout your love

[Pre-Chorus: brb., Jimmy Brown, brb., & Jimmy Brown]

Your love, your love babe, your love, you got me
Something 'bout your love
[Chorus: Jimmy Brown]
Got me open 하늘까지 하나둘
Copped a Birkin, she workin' 무리 않해도
Body perfect 자채로 특별해 넌
Something 'bout your love
Ain't no issues, 다음은없지아마도 (Yeah)
