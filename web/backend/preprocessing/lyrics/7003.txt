13 ContributorsNot Enough Lyrics[Chorus]
Sorry that I'm not enough
Sorry that I just give up
When the going gets tough, all I ever do is run
Sorry that I’m not enough
I'm sorry that I just give up
When the going gets tough, all I ever do is run
I'm sorry that I’m not enough
I'm not enough

[Verse]
4 AM in my room and I'm high again
Always treading cautious, society's a lions den
Feelin' pain, I'm just wishin' that the shit would end
No one listens so I'm crying on the internet
Won’t lie, I don’t know where I should go
Got walls and a roof, but this house ain't home
Rollin’ up dope, I've been outta my zone
I'm drownin' in issues, I’m outta control
Tell the reaper to take my life with a scythe quick
Why is pain the only thing my brain can siphon?
I've been on a journey tryna find some enlightment
Why is death the only concept that gets me excited?
Should I stay or go? That's been on my mind
Feel like you'll get bored of me, I'll be a waste of time
And thoughts of you leavin' been keepin me up at night
So, tell me that we're fine and that we'll be alright

Sorry that I'm not enough
Sorry that I just give up
When the going gets tough, all I ever do is run
Sorry that I'm not enough
I'm sorry that I just give up
When the going gets tough, all I ever do is run
I'm sorry that I'm not enough
I'm not enough14Embed Not Enough Not Enough SadBoyProlific sad
