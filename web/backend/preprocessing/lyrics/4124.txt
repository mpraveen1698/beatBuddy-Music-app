Hold on to me
Pretty baby, and you'll see
I can be all you need

I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me
Pretty baby, and you'll see
I can be all you need

I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me
Pretty baby, and you'll see
I can be all you need

I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me
Pretty baby, and you'll see
I can be all you need

I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me
Pretty baby, and you'll see
I can be all you need

I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me
Pretty baby, and you'll see
I can be all you needEmbed Safe Safe itssvd;Shiloh Dynasty chill
