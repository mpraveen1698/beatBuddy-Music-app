11 ContributorsHate Everything Lyrics[Verse 1]
Had a perfect picture in my head
With you in the most beautiful dress
I look happy as ever
How did I let you go again?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in the rain
Like the kinda movies that we used to hate
Wish I could take back the time
But I know, this time, it's real

[Chorus]
Hate that I'm singing this song
I hate that I have to be strong
Hate that you're gone
I hate all my flaws
Hate that you love someone else
Hate everything
Just hate everything
Right now

[Verse 2]
Had my doubts, but I thought we could work
Gave all I had, but you needed more
We both promised forever
But forever don't last too long

[Chorus]
Hate that I'm singing this song
I hate that I have to be strong
Hate that you're gone
I hate all my flaws
Hate that you love someone else
Hate everything
Just hate everything

[Bridge]
Really wish there was a way
To do it all over and erase
Oh, the beautiful memories
Now is just killing me
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
Hate that I'm singing this song
I hate that I have to be strong
Hate that you're gone
I hate all my flaws
Hate that you love someone else
Hate everything
Just hate everything
Right now
Hate everything
Just hate everything
