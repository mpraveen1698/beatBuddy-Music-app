I can fake it and pretend
I don’t wanna see your face again
And I can find me someone new
But all I want is to be with you

[Verse 2]
I can learn how to let you go
And carry on with the one man show
I’ll fade away into the blue
But all I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you

[Verse 3]
I’ll get dressed and hit the town tonight
Meet some faces under neon lights
I dance alone with deja-vu
But all I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you

[Verse 4]
They said I’d hurt you, said I’d run
Just like I always do with everyone
But you were different I was true
And all I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you
