27 ContributorsMa Baker Lyrics[Intro]
Freeze! I'm Ma Baker
Put your hands in the air and give me all your money!
This is the story of Ma Baker
The meanest cat from old Chicago town

[Verse 1]
She was the meanest cat in old Chicago town
She was the meanest cat, she really mowed them down
She had no heart at all — no, no, no heart at all
She was the meanest cat, oh, she was really tough
She left her husband flat, he wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along 'cause they were mean and strong

[Chorus]
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, she taught her four sons
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, to handle their guns
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, she never could cry
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, but she knew how to die

[Verse 2]
They left a trail of crime across the USA
And when one boy was killed she really made them pay
She had no heart at all — no, no, no heart at all

Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, she taught her four sons
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, to handle their guns
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, she never could cry
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, but she knew how to die

[Verse 3]
Then came a man she liked, she thought she'd stay with him
When he informed on them they did away with him
She didn't care at all, just didn't care at all

[Bridge]
"Here is a special bulletin. Ma Baker is the FBI's most wanted woman. Her photo is hanging on every post office wall. If you have any information about this woman, please contact the nearest police station."
Don't anybody move!
The money or your lives!

[Verse 4]
One day they robbed a bank, it was their last foray
The cops appeared too soon, they couldn't get away
And all the loot they had, it made them mighty mad
And so they shot it out, Ma Baker and her sons
They didn't want to hang, they died with blazing guns
And so the story ends of one who left no friends
[Chorus]
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, she taught her four sons
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, to handle their guns
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, she never could cry
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, but she knew how to die
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, she taught her four sons
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, to handle their guns
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, she never could cry
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma
Ma Baker, but she knew how to die5Embed Ma Baker Love For Sale Boney M. disco
