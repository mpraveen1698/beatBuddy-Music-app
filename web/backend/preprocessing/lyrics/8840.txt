18 ContributorsBroke Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been a week from hell, I lost my job at Five Guys
My girl just kicked me out, she says I'm lame (Horns)
Maybe she's got a point, who gets the sack from Five Guys?
She thinks I'm so incapable of change

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can cut down on my sleep
Give you what you need
Take time and make time, girl
I can stop procrastinating, oh
Be a little more prepared
Show you that I care
I love you, I swear, girl, oh
But tell me

[Chorus]
If I wasn't broke, ooh
Would you spend more time with me like you said you'd do? Oh yeah
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
'Cause the only thing I need is to be loved by you

[Verse 2]
I'm starting out my seventh day of sofa surfing
Parading in my Calvin's with no shame (good lord)
I sit and think to myself, I've hit the low
But look around and see no one to blame
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I can cut down on my sleep
Give you what you need
Take time and make time
I can stop procrastinating, woah-woah-woah-woah
Be a little more prepared
Show you that I care
I love you, I swear, girl, oh
But tell me

[Chorus]
If I wasn't broke, ooh
Would you spend more time with me like you said you'd do? Oh yeah
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
'Cause the only thing I need is to be loved by you

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
If I wasn't broke, ooh
Would you spend more time with me like you said you'd do? Yeah
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
'Cause the only thing I need is to be loved by you, oh
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
