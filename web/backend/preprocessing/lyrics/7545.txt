4 ContributorsCan U Dance (To My Beat) Lyrics[Intro]
As we dance to a beat that seems out of time
To the one you feel in the metronome of your mind
Does it offend you that our rhythm looks strange
Or causes your thinking to be rearranged?
Could it be that you would understand this beat to which we dance
More clearly had you been given a chance
So as you struggle to find the feel with your feet?
Ask yourself, can you dance to my beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat?

Dance

[Interlude]
Can you dance to my beat?
With this beat we dance, wе know we've passed thе test
The freedom we feel in our soul
We dance to learn those lessons as our story continues to unfold
Our beats, our words, our melodies, our gifts
From the givers of those gifts
We're merely the terminals through which they have passed
So as you struggle to catch the rhythm with your feet
Ask yourself, can you dance to my beat, beat, beat, beat, beat
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat?
