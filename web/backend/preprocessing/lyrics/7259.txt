1 ContributorAnything You Want (Not That) LyricsTried to deny I had a weakness for you
Tried to hide I did the best I could do
But you weren't to be convinced or fooled
In no time I couldn't get enough of you
We spent some time doing one thing or another
Never really mattered as long as we were together
I was impressed your tricks worked a treat
Realised too late I shouldn't tell you how I feel
Well I feel for you
I went and fell for you
Well I feel for you
I went and fell for you
Forgive the doe eyed relentless attention
If it's on I'm on and there's no more use in pretending
Close to the chase it's clear you've had fun playing
Some liberties well you've surely been taking
Now you blew me away with your quick turn around
Clocked a reaction I was least expecting
Realised too late if I wanted to keep you
I'll have to be good at treating you mean
Well I feel for you
I went and fell for you
Well I feel for you
I went and fell for you
Oh
I can't deny we had something good
Never see it coming when it coming when it turns on you
Before I knew it I was in too deep, what can I say
Something's just ain't meant to be there
This is trouble and ain't going nowhere
Good riddens to you if that's how you play it
It stops right here I'm throwing you back in
This is a story where no one ever wins
Well I feel for you
I went and fell for you
Well I feel for you
I went and fell for you
Well I feel for you
I went and fell for you
Well I feel for you
I went and fell for you
Yes I did
I went and fell for you
Yes I did
I went and fell for youYou might also likeEmbed Anything You Want - Not That The Express Belleruche trip-hop
