18 ContributorsDrown Lyrics[Verse 1]
No matter where you are
I can still hear you when you drown
You've traveled very far
Just to see you I'll come around
When I'm down

[Hook]
All of those yesterdays
Coming down

[Verse 2]
No matter where you are
I can still hear you when you dream
You traveled very far
You traveled far, like a star
And you are

[Hook]
All of those yesterdays
Coming down

[Bridge 1]
Is it something someone said?
Was it something someone said?

[Bridge 2]
Yesterday the sky was you
And I still feel the same
Nothing left for me to do
And I still feel the same

[Outro]
I wish, I wish I could fly
I wish, I wish I could lie
I will, I will try
I will, I will
