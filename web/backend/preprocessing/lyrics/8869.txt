I'm sorry
I can't find the old me
The one you met all those years ago
I'm sorry
I can't be steady
I've been changing after all those nights alone

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could think back
To when we were younger
To when I changed my hair
And changed my posture
Now you keep me around
Just so you don't feel lonely
And if I think freely
I wonder if you're ever really gonna know me
I wonder if you're ever really gonna know me

[Chorus]
Stop trying to hold on forever (Forever)
Stop trying to belong together
Stop thinking you can make it better
Stop thinking, stop thinking you can make it better
Stop thinking, stop thinking you can make me better
Stop thinking, stop thinking you can make me better
Stop thinking, stop thinking you can make me better

[Verse 2]
You said all your life, â€œI told you so"
And you scream into a pillow every time
I never needed you to love me
I just wanted you take me places
Didn't need you to know me
That's on a need-to-know basis

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope in all your times of self-reflection
You never look back
That you don't feel about love
How I felt about that
This song is for you
When you drive in your car
And if you're listening now
I hope you know who you are
I know you know who you are

[Chorus]
Stop trying to hold on forever
Stop trying to belong together
Stop thinking you can make it better
Stop thinking, stop thinking you can make it better
Stop thinking, stop thinking you can make me better
Stop thinking, stop thinking you can make me better
Stop thinking, stop thinking you can make me better

(Stop, when we were younger)
(Stop, when we were younger)
(Stop, when we were younger)
(Stop, when we were younger)
(Stop, when we were younger)
(Stop, when we were younger)

[Outro]
Stop thinking you can make me better
Stop thinking you can make me better
Stop thinking you can make me betterEmbed Stop Thinking (feat. Lights) Stop Thinking (feat. Lights) Seven Lions;Lights dubstep
