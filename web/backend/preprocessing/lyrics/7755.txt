Weight is coming off, soaring high
Pleading you to stay, come alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to

[Chorus]
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it, but
You won't make the call
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Until it's gone?

[Verse 2]
Fading at the light
Softly say
Get it out my mind anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to

Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it, but
You won't make the call
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Until it's gone?
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor
One step back you're leaving it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
'Till it's gone?

[Bridge]
You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go
You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go
(Running out
You can make it, feel it
Running out
You can make it all)

(Running out
You can make it, feel it
Running out
You can make it all)

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to

[Chorus]
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it, but
You won't make the call (say you mean it, seal it up)
One step back, you're leaving it (say you want to try)
Now it's moving on (say you haven't had enough)
Why won't you believe in it (say you want to)
Until it's gone?
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor (say you mean it, seal it up)
One step back you're leaving it (say you want to try)
Jumping at the wall (say you haven't had enough)
Why won't you believe in it (say you want to)
