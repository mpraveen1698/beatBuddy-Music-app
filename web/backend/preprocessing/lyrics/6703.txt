11 Contributors​say goodbye Lyrics[Intro]
Two, three

[Verse 1]
I'm sick of singing 'bout depression
On the same old chord progression
I'd be A-Okay if I could B how you C me
But F it, and
And I can't wait 'til I've ascended
To those pearly gates in Heaven
If they take one look at my punk ass, just forget it
I won't get in, 'cause

[Chorus]
Yeah, I think life has passed me by
You can say goodbye

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh (Two, three)

[Verse 2]
I sleep myself into a coma
On this whiskey scented sofa
Strum away my days instead of trying to go for
My diploma, so
You might also like[Verse 3]
I tell myself that I'm an artist
It's how I wish to be regarded
It's a full-time job being a fucking fraud
And that's where my heart is, 'cause

[Chorus]
My wholе life has passed me by
You can say goodbyе

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
