Go!

[Verse 1]
So one, two, three
Take my hand and come with me
Because you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine
I said, you look so fine

Come on and get your kicks
Now you don't need that money
When you look like that, do ya, honey?

Big black boots, long brown hair
She's so sweet with her get-back stare

Well, I could see you home with me
But you were with another man, yeah
