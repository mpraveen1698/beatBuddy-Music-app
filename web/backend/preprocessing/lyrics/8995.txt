Who gave them the right?
Waltzing back into
Your life, your life, your life?
Now I feel fear
I wish that they'd never come
Here, here, here

[Chorus]
What they're gonna do, what they're gonna say
Taking you away from my life, my life?

[Verse]
Who gave them the right
Turning it back into light
Tonight, tonight
And then I felt fear
I wish that they'd never come
Here, here, here

[Chorus]
What they're gonna do, what they'rะต gonna say
Taking you away from my life, my life?See No Vacation LiveGet tickets as low as $38You might also like1Embed Waltzing Back Waltzing Back No Vacation garage
