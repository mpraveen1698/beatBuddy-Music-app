3 ContributorsForget I Exist Lyrics[Verse 1]
Of course I do
Try not to think about you
But of course I do
Have you tried
Moving on without you
It's impossible to do
You're impossible to lose
Subconsciously thought I wasn't allowed to

I was just waiting for some kind of sign
That there's not a world that's not you and I

[Chorus]
But this is the end
The plot doesn't twist
You'll never love me again like you did
You might always be someone I miss
But it's okay if you forget I exist
Forget I exist
Forget I exist

[Verse 2]
Of course I try
Blaming it on the timing
But at the time life was hard
And you helped me survive it
So I could never hate you
Or lеt someone replacе you
But of course I try
Of course I try
You might also likeWe're no longer lovers and we're no longer friends
Now all that's left is being strangers again

[Chorus]
But this is the end
The plot doesn't twist
You'll never love me again like you did
You might always be someone I miss
But it's okay if you forget I exist
Forget I exist
Forget I exist

[Bridge]
It's okay if you forget
Everything that you promised
It's okay if you forget
All the things that we wanted
If my name is something that
You longer acknowledge
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

[Chorus]
But this is the end
The plot doesn't twist
You'll never love me again like you did
You might always be someone I miss
But it's okay if you forget I exist
Forget I exist
