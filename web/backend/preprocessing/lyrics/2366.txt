If you need a friend
Don't look to a stranger
You know in the end, I'll always be there
But when you're in doubt
And when you're in danger
Take a look all around, and I'll be there

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say (I promise)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be (Promise)
But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me
I promise, I promise you I will

[Verse 2]
When your day is through
And so is your temper
You know what to do
I'm gonna always be there
Sometimes if I shout
It's not what's intended
These words just come out
With no cross to bear

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say (I promise)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be (Promise)
But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me
I promise, I promise you
You might also likeI'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say (I promise)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be (Promise)
And if I had to walk the world, I'd make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise you I will

[Bridge]
I gotta tell you
Need to tell you
Gotta tell you
I've gotta tell you

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say (I promise)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be (Promise)
But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me (I promise)
I promise, I promise you

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say (I promise)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be (Promise)
And if I had to walk the world, I'd make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise you I will
I will
I willâ€¦7Embed The Promise When In Rome When In Rome synth-pop
