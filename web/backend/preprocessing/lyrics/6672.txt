9 Contributorsâ€‹figured u out Lyrics[Verse 1]
I admit I lost focus
You got me all off track
All the signs unnoticed (Ooh yeah, yeah)
Everybody told me fall back
Can I let it be noted?
Yeah, I know I move too fast (Too fast)
Tryna build something that last
Is that too much to ask?
Look what you started up, what you started now
What we got ourselves into (Yeah yeah)
But I'm smarter now, working harder now
I ain't checking up on you
Take a good look what you lost
Just so you know what it cost
Used to be someone I call
Now you mean nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus]
You gon' see, you gon' see one day (One day, one day)
You've been stuck in your ways, your old ways, always
Left me to figure it out (It out)
I figured you out
I'm 'bout my figures, I'm making a killing
I'm thinking in bigger amounts
You might also like[Chorus]
I figured you out, know what you about
Tell me lies, you're always so defensive
Fill my head up with doubts, I won't bail you out
It took time to come to my senses
Think you're clever, I know better
Took some time to figure it out
You ain't clever, I know better (I know better)
Took some time, but I figured you out

[Verse 2]
Actin' like you so complex
I already know what's next
You keep me callin', swear I keep fallin'
Into every trap you set (Oh)
Had to get up out real fast
Left you in the past, that's that
No love when I swerve right past
Cut you off, yeah, it's just like that
Break me down and you don't pick up the pieces (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
But I built myself, never really did need him (Oh yeah yeah yeah)
You can change it all, but you ain't changed at all (You ain't changed at all)
I might take a loss, but you the one that lost

[Pre-Chorus]
You gon' see, you gon' see one day (One day, one day, yeah)
You've been stuck in your ways, your old ways, always
Left me to figure it out (It out)
I figured you out
I'm 'bout my figures, I'm making a killing
I'm thinking in bigger amounts
[Chorus]
I figured you out, know what you about
Tell me lies, you're always so defensive (Always so defensive)
Fill my head up with doubts, I won't bail you out
It took time to come to my senses
Think you're clever, I know better (I know better, baby)
Took some time to figure it out
You ain't clever, I know better (You ain't, I know better)
Took some time, but I figured you out (I figured)1Embed figured u out i hope u see this thuy chill
