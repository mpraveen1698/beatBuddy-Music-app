Da dada.....all i wanted..

[Chorus]

All i wanted was
Rainbow&sunshine(3x)
All around us

I said all i  want is
Rainbow&sunshine(3x)
All around us

[Verse 1]

I said i hate,she hates,she late,fuck faith the anger
She hates me and loves me,feel like i'm loving a stranger
Fake love she wants the hills,but i ain't no ranger
She been stick on me like glue since, I've been dropping banger's
She a changer,i guess even demons can be angels,i can't hold my
Tears,i need a trainer,mixed emotions like teenager, she don't
Really care cause she got them in container,hope you find someone
Like me so

You can feel in danger uh,yah(2x)
You might also likeCause,cause,cause

[Verse 2]

You have gotten diamonds nails you've been leaving scars
Your cars running out of road now you drown in bars
Even i surprised you made so far yeah, used by other man that see as an object not a star...

We could had everything that you wanted,sail the seven seas with no memory forgotted,feel the energy of what it feels to be loved, but..now,you live in agony with the live that u wanted,exhausted at your memory's that will always keep you hunted

[Bridge]

Yeah..,swear u,i really wish well my friend,but in my soul your forgotten

[Chorus]

SUNSHINE
RAINBOW

[Outro]
