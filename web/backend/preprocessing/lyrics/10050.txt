2 ContributorsTraining Day (Part 2) Lyrics23 EXT. CRENSHAW BOULEVARD - DAY 23

ON DEALER wheeling away. He sees Jake, speeds up. Then suddenly darts into a wig shop.

A24 INT. WIG SHOP - DAY A24

The Dealer heads for the back. Where a door leads out to an alley. He reaches for the door handle. Jake tackles him. Gets the Dealer in a compliance hold and cuffs him. Alonzo enters the store, badges the owner.

ALONZO
Love doing that, huh?

Jake searches the Dealer as rows of display heads stare with blind eyes.

ALONZO
Who you work for, shitstain?

DEALER
Can't work. I'm on disability.

ALONZO
Bullshit. You crackin'.

Jake finishes searching.

ALONZO
No rocks?
JAKE
No rocks.

DEALER
(laughing)
Aw, dang. See? Y'all ain't got shit. The man comin' up short again.

Alonzo glares.

ALONZO
I never come up short, fool.
Open your mouth.

The Dealer does. Sensing to not play with Alonzo.

ALONZO
Lift your tongue.

He does.

DEALER
See. I ain't be gottin' shit.

ALONZO
Gimme a pen.
Jake does. Alonzo grabs the Dealer's neck. Forces the pen in his mouth. Down his throat. He gags -- urgh! Vomits.

DEALER
Shit, man!

Jake is stunned. Alonzo inspects the spattered sidewalk. Sees Saran-wrapped rocks.

ALONZO
Lookie those.

DEALER
That's corn.

ALONZO
That's Jimmy crack corn and I
don't care. One, two, three, four, five... six. How'd you swallow that shit without water?

DEALER
This is bullshit! Civil rights
violatin' motherfuckers.

Alonzo slaps him.

ALONZO
Gonna act like a man or a bitch?!
Got you cold. Wanna go to jail? Or go home? Gimme a name.
The Dealer mulls it over.

DEALER
He in County.

ALONZO
Who?

DEALER
Sandman. He's shot callin'.

ALONZO
Unhook him, Hoyt.
(to Dealer)
You on my team now. Be seeing you, homie.

Jake unlocks the cuffs. Alonzo steps over the vomit and crack.

ALONZO
And collect the evidence.

JAKE
Hell no.

ALONZO
You're learning.

24 INT. G-RIDE (WATTS) - MOVING - DAY 24

Jake keeps looking at Alonzo, half impressed, half appalled.

ALONZO
What?

JAKE
You don't give a shit. That stuff
doesn't fly anymore. What if that guy complains?


CUT TO:

ALONZO
To who?

JAKE
Look, I like my badge.

Alonzo gives a reassuring look, dials a cell phone.

ALONZO
Afternoon, Bob. It's Alonzo. Got your gang book?
(beat)
I need a res. Sandman from Mobsters... might be in custody.
(beat)
Okay, shoot.

Alonzo jots the information on a note pad.

ALONZO
Thank you, sir. That's gonna do
it. Have a good one.

Alonzo hangs up. Shows Jake the address with a grin.

JAKE
We go after the Sandman?

ALONZO
We go after the Sandman.

Jake smiles.

25 EXT. SANDMAN'S STREET - DAY 25

Near 13th and Mona Blvd. Graffiti on a wall: "MOBSTERS HOOD -- SANDMAN." The G-Ride glides INTO FRAME and OUT.

ANGLE

The G-Ride parks in front of a house. Alonzo and Jake exit. Alonzo pops the trunk. Inside is a microwave box, toaster, a boom box, a TV.

JAKE
Gonna open a Circuit City?

ALONZO
It's unclaimed shit from property.
I pass it out to informants, victims, witnesses. Help their families out.

Alonzo fishes out an LAPD Windbreaker, "POLICE" across the back. Hands it to Jake.

ALONZO
Wear that. Intel says his wife's
in the residence with two female juveniles and a possible male juvenile.

JAKE
If he's not here, why are we here?
Alonzo pulls a paper out of his pocket, unfolds it.

ALONZO
We gotta serve this search
warrant.

It's the Chinese take-out menu Jake handed him earlier.

JAKE
We can't do that.

ALONZO
Yes we can, supercop. Ding-ding,
that's the school bell.

He slams the trunk. Pulls his gun. They cross to the door.

JAKE
Get a real warrant.

ALONZO
I wanna get shit done.

26 EXT. SANDMAN'S HOUSE - DAY 26

They step onto the porch. Take sides by the front door.

ALONZO
Don't get me killed, new guy.

He knocks on the security screen.

ALONZO
Police! Search warrant!


Silence. Alonzo knocks again. Nods at Jake.

JAKE
L.A.P.D.! Open the door.

Nothing. Then:

SANDMAN'S WIFE (O.S.)
Kevin ain't here. He up at the
Honor Ranch.

ALONZO
L.A.P.D.! Please open the door or
we kick it in! Ma'am?!

CLICKING. The door is unlocked, opened. SANDMAN'S WIFE, an attractive black woman, stands on the other side of the security screen. Alonzo waves the menu.

ALONZO
Search warrant. Unlock the door
and back away.

She does, Alonzo snaps it open, rushes in, Jake follows.

27 INT. SANDMAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 27

Jake and Alonzo swinging guns around the room -- two scared toddlers in a playpen. Sandman's Wife sits on the couch.

JAKE
Stand up, ma'am.

He searches the couch for a weapon.

ALONZO
Anyone else in the house, ma'am?

SANDMAN'S WIFE
My nephew, Dimitri. He in the
bedroom. The boy is ten.

ALONZO
Cover her. Gonna clear the house.

JAKE
You can sit. Please keep your
hands on your knees.

Alonzo exits through a doorway into the kitchen.

ALONZO (O.S.)
Kitchen's clear!

We hear ALONZO moving through the bedrooms.

ALONZO (O.S.)
Bedrooms're clear! Bringing out the kid!

Alonzo marches Dimitri, 10, into the living room. The youngster trembles.

ALONZO
S'okay, son, we're the good guys.
Go sit on the couch with your aunt -- House is code-four. Gonna start my search.

Alonzo exits. Sandman's Wife glares at Jake.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
I wanna read the warrant.
Supposed to give me a copy.

JAKE
(reacts)
My partner has it.

She looks out the window at the empty street.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
Where's your back-up?

JAKE
Ma'am, please be quiet while we
conduct our investigation.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
You got the gun, boss.
(sotto)
Crooked-ass pigs.

The kids stare at Jake like an occupying soldier. He crosses to Dimitri, smiles.

JAKE
Hey, little man. How's it going?

Jake tries to shake. Dimitri crosses his arms, looks away. Sandman's Wife smirks.

O.S., the SOUNDS of Alonzo tearing apart the bedrooms like a hurricane. Making a hell of a mess. Sandman's Wife stands.

JAKE
Ma'am. Stay seated.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
Who you be thinkin'? Comin' in like you pay the rent.

JAKE
Ma'am, sit down.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
Both y'alls stink. Drinkin' all
day. Gotta get liquored up to do business?

Alonzo is suddenly quiet. Jake backs to the doorway, peeks around it. Sees a dresser with a mirror.

IN MIRROR
Alonzo shoves something big down his jacket.

BACK TO SCENE

JAKE
Siddown. Now.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
Gonna shoot me, boss? Kids, don't
look. The drunk policeman gonna shoot me now.

Alonzo enters, excited, grinning.

ALONZO
Didn't find shit. Let's go --
sorry about the inconvenience, ma'am. Thank you for your cooperation.

He and Jake head for the door.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
I wanna see the warrant.

ALONZO
Here.

He hands her the menu as they exit.


CUT TO:

28 EXT. SANDMAN'S STREET - DAY 28

At the end of the block, three big gangsters buy Popsicles from an ice cream truck.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sandman's Wife bursts out of the house, screams at Jake and Alonzo as they climb in the G-Ride.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
Y'all jackers! You ain't no damn police! Get on back here with my
money!

She sees the gangsters.

SANDMAN'S WIFE
Why y'all standin' there lookin'
pretty?! Blast them fools!

The gangsters trade looks. Start running towards --

G-RIDE

Alonzo sees the gangsters. Tries STARTING the CAR. The engine won't catch.

ALONZO
C'mon, baby. Don't do me like
that.

The gangsters getting closer.

ALONZO
You bitch! Start!

Jake sees a Glock pulled from a waistband.

JAKE
Gun! Gun! Gun!

VAROOM! Alonzo SQUEALS from the driveway.

The armed gangster drops to one knee. The G-Ride tear- asses away in Glock's sights.

POP!-POP!-POP!-POP!-POP!

A ROUND SHATTERS a taillight. ANOTHER pierces the trunk--

29 INT. G-RIDE (SANDMAN'S STREET) - DAY 29

-- the back seat -- the front seat -- the six-pack -- and finally the dash. Jake reacting to beer spray.

30 INT./EXT. G-RIDE (FREEWAY) - DAY 30

Alonzo rounds the corner, tosses the wounded cans out the window.

ALONZO
Shit... Let's hit a liquor store.

Jake fingers the hole in the dash.

ALONZO
Gun! Gun! Gun!

Jake startles, Alonzo laughing.

ALONZO
First time you been shot at?

JAKE
(lies)
No.

ALONZO
Yeah, it was. Take the jacket
off.

Jake does, Alonzo takes whatever is in his jacket, wraps it in the raid jacket and sets it at his feet.

JAKE
That wasn't cool. That wasn't
cool at all. Where's the Sandman? What the hell were you doing in there?

ALONZO
Looking for narcotics activity.
Scales. Baggies. Guns. Coke. Bud. Etcetera.

JAKE
Cash...?

ALONZO
Speak on it, son.

JAKE
She was screaming about money.

ALONZO
Bitch was talking shit. Trying to
get us blasted by her homies.

Jake looks at the raid jacket.

JAKE
What?

ALONZO
JAKE
I dunno. I'm just a new guy. A
daisy-fresh boot. You tell me what.

ALONZO
I don't deny my shit stinks. I
will never deny that. So why do I got the best arrest and conviction record in the county. Why? 'Cause I don't handicap myself with bullshit.

JAKE
I thought that bullshit served a
purpose.

ALONZO
You thought wrong. There's some profoundly evil people
walking free on the streets right now who've killed three, four, five people. I know it, they know it, every detective on payroll knows it. Why do these turds still float around? The rules. I take down the duly deserving. I'm not locking up Mr. Nine-to-five, Mr.Family Provider.

Jake shaking his head angrily.

ALONZO
C'mon, communicate. What aren't
you saying? Talk to me.

A beat. Then Jake fixes Alonzo with a stare.

JAKE
I think... I think you're a rogue
cop.

Alonzo laughs his ass off. Wipes his eyes, he laughs so hard. Ahead on the freeway, a Highway Patrol cruiser is on the opposite shoulder.

ALONZO
Hoyt, man. Know what? You're
alright. You are alright.

JAKE
Whatever. I'm gonna be on the six
o'clock news in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs because of you. With the scandals and whatnot, it's open season on misconduct. They'll nail us to the wall.
(worried, repentant)
God, what the hell did I just do?

Alonzo holds up a finger for him to stop and pulls over on the shoulder opposite the cruiser. A highway patrolman helps a distressed female motorist change a tire.

ALONZO
You're in a privileged position to
learn a thing or two if you can keep your mouth shut and your eyes open. If you're serious about doing good in the real world,
this is the place to learn how. Gun! Gun! Gun! If this shit shakes you up, go back to Division and cry to the Watch Commander. He'll find you a nice job lighting flares and measuring wrecks. Decide now if you want to be a wolf or a sheep. If you want on my squad, I'll sign your card.

Alonzo stops the car. Alonzo puts his foot on the dash, reveals his unit's tattoo on his ankle. Jake reacts.

ALONZO
Get your ink.
(re: the patrolman)
Or get out and give him a hand.

Alonzo reaches over and opens Jake's door. Jake looks around, looks at the tattoo. Forget it, he's out. Jake exits the car. Jake stands on the shoulder, squints at the patrolman fighting lugnuts. Jake knows what he wants to do. He gets back in the G-ride. Slams the door and nails Alonzo with a steely look of resolve.

JAKE
I'm in.

Alonzo holds out his hand. Jake shakes, serious. Solemn.

ALONZO
Welcome to Narcotics, Officer
Hoyt.

JAKE
I'm going to do my best.

ALONZO
You do and you'll run the unit
some day.
(a beat)
You hungry? Let's code seven. Alonzo SCREECHES out of there.

OMITTED 31 thru 37

38 INT. G-RIDE (JUNGLE) - MOVING - DAY 38

Jake nervously glances around one of the toughest parts of the city. A strong point adorned with wrought iron and concertina wire. Alonzo looks around cautiously, puts his gun in his lap, wary.

JAKE
What are you doing? We'll be
killed coming in here.

ALONZO
Oh, you've heard about this neck
of the woods?

JAKE
This is the Jungle. They said
never come in here with anything less than a platoon.

39 EXT. G-RIDE (CUL-DE-SAC) - MOVING - DAY 39

Alonzo enters a cul-de-sac of run-down houses and apartments. Formidable fences line the entire block. A fortress.

ALONZO
This is the heart right here. The
headquarters. A lot of murder investigations lead here. One way in, no way out. Strictly heavy hitters. Damus don't play.

Jake is really uncomfortable.

JAKE
I thought we were going to eat.

A little kid runs out of the corner house. He eyes Alonzo, then hops on his bike and rides OUT OF VIEW into the cul-de-sac. A beat. The little kid returns. Waves Alonzo into the cul-de-sac. Alonzo turns onto the dangerous dead-end, driving around a poorly-parked van.

ALONZO
Lots of eyes on us right now.
Never come up in here without me. For your safety. I'm serious.

JAKE
Okay. Why do you have a golden
pass?

The little kid gives Jake an unsettling maddog stare.

ALONZO
Because I'm square with 'em. But
they know if the line is crossed, I'm leading the platoon in here.

Two solid, early teen gangsters lean against a fence. One claps sharply. Alonzo gestures for Jake to look up through the windshield.

JAKE'S POV
A dozen pigeons dive from the sky, right at the G-ride.

BACK TO SCENE

Jake reacts. The gangster claps his hands again and the pigeons pull out of their dive and arc back into the sky. The gangster smiles at Alonzo.

JAKE
What the hell was that?

ALONZO
They're flipping pigeons to let
folks know I'm here.

Jake looking at Alonzo, lost. Alonzo grins.

At the far end of a driveway, more gangsters work out and drink. One of them is benching over 300 pounds.

Alonzo parks at the end of the cul-de-sac. Jake and Alonzo get out. Cross to a gate where two more GANGSTERS kick it. They look at Jake.

GANGSTER
'Sup, Lonz. Thanks for helping
my cousin.

ALONZO
I got your back, dog.
(re: Jake)
He's my people.

Alonzo pushes open the gate. The gangsters regard him coldly as he passes.

NEW ANGLE

Behind Alonzo's back, the gangsters' disposition becomes disdain.

GANGSTER
Sick'a that pig actin' like king-
shit.

40 EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - DAY 40

Kids play in the bare dirt yard. A huge pit bull is chained to a tree.

JAKE
(re: the gangsters)
And those guys?

ALONZO
Punk ass fools. I got all these
busters under my thumb.

An old woman sweeps her doorstep and glares at Jake.

ALONZO
Buenas tardes, Dona Lucila.

The old woman smiles, nods. Jake and Alonzo cross to some stairs, climb the steps. A 15-year-old girl exits with a laundry basket. Alonzo leers.

ALONZO
Gonna throw her dad in jail.
Raise her up myself. Like veal.

Jake reacts, unsure if Alonzo is joking.

41 EXT. SARA'S APARTMENT - DAY 41 Alonzo knocks on a door.

JAKE
What's here?

ALONZO
A loving touch.

WOMAN (O.S.)
Quien...?

ALONZO
Policia, senorita.

The door opens, there stands SARA, a ravishing Salvadoran in a housedress. She hugs Alonzo, plants a big kiss on him.

SARA
Hi, papi.

She notices Jake and backs off.

ALONZO
He's just my new guy.

She holds out her hand. They shake.

SARA
Hi. How are you?

JAKE
Good, thank you.

SARA
Come in, come in. Welcome to my
house.

Alonzo enters, Jake follows.

42 INT. SARA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 42

The living room is filled with Salvadoran kitsch. It's bright, airy, a refuge. A 2-year-old boy on the couch watches cartoons. Alonzo motions for Jake to sit.

ALONZO
You had a rough morning. Relax
and let her hook you up.

He disappears into the bedroom. Sara hands Jake the remote.

SARA
Here. Take this. I have cable.
You watch what you want. This is your house. Don't be shy.

She crosses to the kitchen. Sounds of POTS, DISHES. Jake is about to change the channel. The kid gives him a look. He puts away the remote.
Sara returns with a massive tray of food, chicken stew, beans, rice, salad, tortillas, the works. She sets the mouth-watering spread before Jake.

SARA
This is El Salvador food. I hope
you like it.

CUT TO:

JAKE
Thank you. This is great. I'm
starving.

She hangs a beat, embarrassed.

SARA
I'm sorry. I have to...

Jake knows. She runs off.

43 INT. SARA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY (LATER) 43

Jake dozes, his plate wiped clean, an arm around the little kid, still watching cartoons. Alonzo enters, invigorated, he kicks Jake's foot.

ALONZO
Let's go. We're rollin'. Gotta
meeting in fifteen.

Jake stirs, stretches. Stands. Alonzo shows him the door.

ALONZO
Go to the car.

JAKE
I'd like to thank her for the
food. It was great.

ALONZO
I'll tell her, don't worry.
Jake tussles the kid's hair.

JAKE
See you later, little man.

Jake exits. Alonzo picks up his son. Hugs him tight.

ALONZO (subtitled)
Hey. Como esta, mijo? Te portas bien? Esta creciendo, papasito. (How are you, son? You're getting big.)

Sara watches from the bedroom doorway. Seeing Alonzo like this rips her apart.

CUT TO:

44 INT. G-RIDE (6TH STREET) - MOVING - DAY 44

Heading east on 6th Street. The buildings of downtown loom ahead. The noon sun high and bright.

JAKE
What about your queen?

ALONZO
Sara's my princess.

JAKE
I like her. She's a really cool
lady.

ALONZO
So are her two sisters. They look
damn good and they party. How'd you like to be in the middle of a bitch sandwich? Come to Vegas with us.

JAKE
No, thanks. I get mine at home.

ALONZO
You're missing out. I should
know.

JAKE
Her kid looks just like you. He's
number five?

ALONZO
Number six.

JAKE
Six kids. That's all? Or you
holding royal court in a few more houses?

ALONZO
I'm only aware of six.

JAKE
It's easy to make a baby --

ALONZO
-- and hard to take care of one.
Fuck you, okay? No one's going hungry. Everyone gets plenty of what they need: toys, shoes, clothes.

JAKE
Love?

Alonzo shoots a look at Jake.

ALONZO
Let's not talk about my family.

CUT TO:

45 INT./EXT. G-RIDE/PACIFIC DINING CAR - DAY 45

The G-Ride pulls up to the downtown L.A. landmark. Alonzo's CELL RINGS.

ALONZO
Get out.

Jake does. Alonzo talks on his cell a heated beat. Jake overhears:

ALONZO
You'll get the damn money.

Alonzo hangs up, exits the car uncharacteristically shaken. He and Jake cross to the entrance. Alonzo slips an old man polishing shoes a twenty. Alonzo, the raid jacket tucked underarm, hands Jake some eyedrops.

ALONZO
Use it.

Jake does. Alonzo opens the door.

JAKE
Who's here?

ALONZO
Don't speak unless spoken to.Embed Fresh New Kicks Fresh New Kicks Dimitri K hardcore
