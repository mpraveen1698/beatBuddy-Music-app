1 ContributorTherapie Taxi - Hit Sale ft. Romeo Elvis (English translation) Lyrics[Verse 1: Adélaïde]
There's the sentences you say, the sentences of easy guys
The sentences I forget, drunk in the night
And your body that twists
But you know, me, I bite your imaginary dreams

[Bridge: Adélaïde and Raphaël]
There's bugs in my head
Imaginary dreams
There's bugs in my head
When I stub out my cigarette

[Refrain : Adélaïde and Raphaël]
Here, everybody's losing their mind (everybody's losing their mind)
You're a hundred times too, a hundred timеs too fine
You bugged our guts(bugged our guts)
You'rе a thousand times too, a thousand times too sex
You keep dancing on dirty hits
If you were mine, you'd be my snack
You keep dancing on dirty hits
If you were mine, you'd be my snack

[Verse 2 : Roméo Elvis]
I lack practical application like GSMs
You fixed the wrong that I had left
You're a thousand times too fine for me to be angry
But now, you're controlling me and that, you know it
You keep dancing on dirty hits, you put on a XL sweater, we can still see your boobies
I could be your hottie, I could do you some wrong 'cause
You light up all the flames and I'm docile like a loser
You might also like[Refrain : Adélaïde and Raphaël]
Here, everybody's losing their mind (everybody's losing their mind)
You're a hundred times too, a hundred times too fine
You bugged our guts(bugged our guts)
You're a thousand times too, a thousand times too sex
You keep dancing on dirty hits
If you were mine, you'd be my snack
You keep dancing on dirty hits
If you were mine, you'd be my snack

[Verse 3 : Adélaïde]
There's hundreds of warriors
Ready to risk it all for me
To bleed for the glory
Of seeing my body sitting down
Next to them
A visceral thought that ends up driving them nuts
My scent like an altar, the others are blasphemy
Here, everybody's losing their mind
I'm a hundred times too, a hundred times too fine

[Refrain : Adélaïde and Raphaël]
Here, everybody's losing their mind (everybody's losing their mind)
You're a hundred times too, a hundred times too fine
You bugged our guts (bugged our guts)
You're a thousand times too, a thousand times too sex
You keep dancing on dirty hits
If you were mine, you'd be my snack
You keep dancing on dirty hits
If you were mine, you'd be my snack
[Outro : Adélaïde, Roméo Elvis and Raphaël]
You keep dancing on dirty hits
(Here, everybody, everybody's losing their mind)
You keep dancing on dirty hits
(You're a thousand times too, a thousand times too sex)
You keep dancing on dirty hits,you put on a XL sweater, we can still see your boobies
I could be your hottie, I could do you some wrong 'cause
You light up all the flames and I'm docile like a loserEmbed Hit Sale (feat. Roméo Elvis) Hit Sale Therapie TAXI;Roméo Elvis french
