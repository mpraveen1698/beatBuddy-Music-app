5 ContributorsMercy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fuck who you came with (Fuck 'em)
All these guns be blazin' (Blazin')
I told 'em this is war now
Remember all your trainin' (Word)
My chamber waitin', no time for patience
Front-line slaughter, lines be cravin'
True marauder, I get to raidin'
I want the blood, slice with the blade
Marks on my face, fight for the days
They run away, keep up the chase
Do not behave, I am enraged
This my last hope, drawn' all measures (Word)
Crash course, leave your treasure (Word)
Mad dog, keep your head up
Fight night, now or never (Ayy)

[Chorus]
I told 'em I'd fight for this, I told 'em I'd die for this
This that wrong or right, but I like that righteousness
Through all the tiredness, throw me into that firepit
Flames rise in the times I get lost in my environment

[Build]
RIP, I'm 'bout to go
God have mercy on my soul

[Verse 2]
From the top of the sky, parachutin', I'm pullin' the line
Overseein' that battlefield, I'm the general, my war cry
Louder than ever, I'm 'bout to endeavor
I got my troops, we lighter than feathers
Movin' through trenches, breakin' defenses
Bullets flyin', we sendin' a message (Message)
No Morse code needed, we fightin', we bleedin' (Bleedin')
Through all the seasons, they tried to break me like we talkin' treason (Yes sir)
We on a rush 'cause we don't miss and that's a must
'Cause if we miss, then we turn to dust
Throwin' fists, we take the punch, mm (Ayy)

[Chorus]
I told 'em I'd fight for this, I told 'em I'd die for this
This that wrong or right, but I like that righteousness
Through all the tiredness, throw me into that firepit
Flames rise in the times I get lost in my environment

[Build]
RIP, I'm 'bout to go
God have mercy on my soul
