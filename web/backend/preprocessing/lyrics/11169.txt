1 ContributorComing Up Roses LyricsFrom the Album: All the Things I Meant to Be (1992)
I once had a dream, or should I say a dream once had me
Now, whenever I breathe it breaks like a window, a white light I can't see
And everything's coming up roses
And everything's coming up roses
And I feel sometimes, you wake me up and
The ground around me is growing roses
And I feel sometimes, you shake me up and
Each word you whisper's growing roses
I once had a need, and just like a flower, it still grows inside me
Now I feel so alive, it hurts just a little, but the hurt sets your mind free
And everything's coming up roses
And everything's coming up roses
And I feel sometimes, you wake me up and
This broken ground is growing roses
And I feel sometimes , you shake me up and
Each word you whisper's growing roses
Rose, love. My love's a rose, love, a red red rose love. My love's a rose
Rose, love. My love's a rose, love, a red red rose love. My love's a rose
And everything's coming up roses
And everything's coming up roses
Rose, love. My love's a rose, love, a red red rose love. My love's a rose
Rose, love. My love's a rose, love, a red red rose love. My love's a roseYou might also likeEmbed Wake Me Up Wake Me Up Roses & Frey acoustic
