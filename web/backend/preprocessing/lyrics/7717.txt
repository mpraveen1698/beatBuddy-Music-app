39 ContributorsBad Girls Club Lyrics[Intro]
Hahaha
Oh my god, that'd be amazing
Bad girls club

[Verse 1]
I met a girl, and I really thought she liked me
I truly thought that I had met the one
It was a fail, to no avail
I'm just another victim of the bad girls club
She's like a witch, casting spells, hypnotizing
She made me drink a potion just to fall in love
She got me drunk, tipsy off her love
I'm just another victim of the bad girls club

[Verse 2]
She's always blowing up my phone
I really wish that she'd leave me alone
I gotta change my number, hard for me to slumber
When she's outside my home
She called the cops
And made it seem like I was mean
She's not your average lady, she is fucking crazy
Spelled C-U-N-T (Bitch!)

[Pre-Chorus]
And after all the rise and fall
You're not worth my time
See Falling in Reverse LiveGet tickets as low as $99You might also like[Chorus]
I'm ca-ca-calling it quits, right now, this time
You're playing games, and all we do is fight, it's getting lame
So olly olly olly oxen free
All the bad girls, come cheer with me
Your love's a drug, you got me on the run
I’m just another victim of the bad girls club

[Verse 3]
I'm always paranoid (Yeah I’m paranoid, hahaha)
That she's somehow watching me
Follows me on Twitter, asking if I miss her
Hashtag: set me free
She Googles my name
Just to keep some tabs on me
She's not your average lady, she is fucking crazy
Someone, help me, please (Someone help me please)

[Pre-Chorus]
And after all the rise and fall
You're not worth my time

[Chorus]
I'm ca-ca-calling it quits, right now, this time
You're playing games, and all we do is fight, it's getting lame
So olly olly olly oxen free
All the bad girls, come cheer with me
Your love's a drug, you got me on the run
I’m just another victim of the bad girls club
[Bridge]
Alright, alright, alright, settle down, settle down
I need all my bad girls in the house tonight to help me do a cheer
It goes: one, two, three, four
Hey, sexy boy, I got you wrapped around my finger
L-O-V-E really doesn't mean much
Your love is like a drug, but it is not enough
Give me a B-A-D, we're the bad girls club
Hey, sexy boy, I got you wrapped around my finger
L-O-V-E really doesn't mean much
Your love is like a drug, but it is not enough
Give me a B-A-D, we're the bad girls club

[Chorus]
I'm ca-ca-calling it quits, right now, this time
You're playing games, and all we do is fight, it's getting lame
So olly olly olly oxen free
All the bad girls, come cheer with me
Your love's a drug, you got me on the run
I’m just another victim of the bad girls club
I'm just another victim of the bad girls club
I'm just another victim of the bad girls club
