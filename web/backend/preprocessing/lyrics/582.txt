The hard days are nearly over
And we've been hangin' on
It feels like we're getting closer
To dawn

[Pre-Chorus]
We took the long way up to heaven
And got blinded by the lights
But as long as we're together
I know it will be alright

[Chorus]
I see a better day
I see a better day for you, for you and me, a-ayy
I see a better day
Yeah, everything is gonna change for you and me

[Rise]

[Drop]
(A better day)

[Verse 2]
I knew we were gonna make it
I never had a doubt
Soon we'll be feeling weightless
Like clouds
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
We took the long way up to heaven
And got blinded by the lights
But as long as we're together
I know it will be alright

[Chorus]
I see a better day
I see a better day for you, for you and me, a-ayy
I see a better day
Yeah, everything is gonna change for you and me

[Rise]

[Drop]
