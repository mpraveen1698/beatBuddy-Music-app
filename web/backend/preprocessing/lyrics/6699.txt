7 ContributorsCinnamon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Evergreens and a dream of an island town
Draw a line in the sand and we'll smooth it down
Will your side win? Get to the middle
Count them off one at a time
And we'll try to guess right

[Chorus]
Waking in the white sun, lights out
Wading through the days in, nights out
It’s a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell is pulling me under

Rowing in a wooded hollow
Showing me the moves to follow
It’s a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell is pulling me under

[Verse 2]
It's a hand on the ground that's around for an hour of hope
It disappears as the sea takes it in and swallows it whole
And just as it leaves, just as it's sinking
The morning will save our souls
From too cold, to keep low

[Chorus]
Waking in the white sun, lights out
Wading through the days in, nights out
It’s a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell is pulling me under

[Bridge]
Waking in the white sun, lights out
Wading through the days in, nights out
It’s a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell is pulling me under

[Chorus]
Waking in the white sun, lights out
Wading through the days in, nights out
It’s a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell is pulling me under

Rowing in a wooded hollow
Showing me the moves to follow
It’s a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell is pulling me under5Embed Cinnamon Tunnels Jome folk
