25 ContributorsGROWING UP IS _____ Lyrics[Verse 1]
Heard you moved out of town on the weekend
Understand, but I'm sad that you’re leavin'
Are you up makin' friends with the ceilin’?
Yeah, I know the feelin'
I wasn't tryin' to let you down
I was just workin' my shit out
I'm sorry I didn't know how much I led you on

[Chorus]
Growin' up is weird
Sleep with friends, break a heart
Question everything you thought
Split a pill, smoke a dart
Growin’ up is weird
Fall in love for a year
And then I disappear
Wish that you were here
Growin’ up is strange
Get too close, push away
Thinkin' you would do the same
New regrets, new mistakes
Growin’ up is strange
When the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror
Wish that you were here
Growin' up is—

Get emotional at two in the mornin’
It's a habit, no, I shouldn't be callin'
Then you let me in, is that what you wanted?
Is this what we wanted?
Now you're back in town, no, I can't come around
Are we better without the what-ifs and doubts?
Is this it?
Are we both too far gone to forget and try again?

[Chorus]
Growin' up is weird
Sleep with friends, break a heart
Question everything you thought
Split a pill, smoke a dart
Growin' up is weird
Fall in love for a year
And then I disappear
Wish that you were here
Growin' up is strange
Get too close, push away
Thinkin' you would do the same
New regrets, new mistakes
Growin' up is strange
When the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror
Wish that you were here
Growin' up is—
[Bridge]
Wish that you were here (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But I'll just disappear
Wish that you were here

[Chorus]
Growin' up is weird
Sleep with friends, break a heart
Question everything you thought
Split a pill, smoke a dart
Growin' up is weird
Fall in love for a year
And then I disappear
Wish that you were here
Growin' up is strange
Get too close, push away
Thinkin' you would do the same
New regrets, new mistakes
Growin' up is strange
When the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror
Wish that you were here
Growin' up is weird

[Outro]
Oh, but I'll just disappear
Oh, yeah, I just disappeared
Wish that you were here
Growin' up is—10Embed GROWING UP IS _____ GROWING UP IS _____ Ruel alternative
