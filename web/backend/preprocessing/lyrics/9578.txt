38 ContributorsSay Hello 2 Heaven Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Please, mother mercy, take me from this place
And the long-winded curses I hear in my head
The words never listen, and teachers, oh, they never learn
My warmth from the candle, though I feel too cold to burn
He came from an island, then he died from the street
And he hurt so bad like a soul breakin', but he never said nothin' to me, yeah

[Chorus]
A-say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven
Say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven, yeah

[Verse 2]
New like a baby, and lost like a prayer
The sky was your playground, but the cold ground was your bed
Ooh, I said, poor Stargazer, she's got no tears in her eyes
But fool like a whisper, she knows that love heals all wounds with time
Now it seem like too much love is never enough
Yeah, you better seek out another road, 'cause this one has ended abrupt, oh!

[Chorus]
A-say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven
A-say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven
A-say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven, ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
I, I never wanted to write these words down for you
With the pages of phrases of all the things we'll never do
Hey, so I blow out, out the candle, and I put you to bed
Since you can't say to me now how the dog broke your bone, there's just one thing left to be said!

[Chorus]
A-say hello to heaven, to heaven, yeah
A-say hello to heaven, to heaven, yeah
A-say hello to heaven! To heaven! Yeah!
A-say hello to heaven! To heaven! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Outro]
Oh-oh
