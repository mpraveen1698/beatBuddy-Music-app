Maybe I've been wasting time, my state of mind's
Been a little hazy lately, but I stay alive
Come take a dive, inside my head
Feeling down but never out, I'm hanging by a thread
I'm wasting time, my state of mind's
Been a little hazy lately, but I stay alive
Come take a dive, inside my head
Feeling down but never out, I'm hanging by a thread

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I'm dying, sometimes I feel already dead
I got an obsession, perceptions kinda messing with my head
I wake up in a daze, don't even keep track of days
I got a problem with myself, but I know I'll be okay
I got a lot of pressure built, hope I don't crack the foundation
I think it's maybe time for me to change the location
I don't know what I'm doing, usually I'm just pacing
And wondering if everything I want is worth chasing

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn, 3AM and I'm wide awake
Nothing changes pack it up, and just drive away
Sick and tired of this every day hideaway
This every day hideaway

[Chorus]
Maybe I've been wasting time, my state of mind's
Been a little hazy lately, but I stay alive
Come take a dive, inside my head

I'm wasting time, my state of mind's
Been a little hazy lately, but I stay alive
Come take a dive, inside my head
Feeling down but never out, I'm hanging by a thread

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm hanging by a thread, pulled it from my pockets
I know I say it all the time, but I don't ever plan on stopping
No matter the circumstance, I'm battered it's worth a chance
I bet I'll be better tomorrow, I'm done with the sorrows
Damn, wasting all this time stressed about what's out of my control
Life is a journey the best thing you can do it, is ride it slow
The highs and lows will come and go you better buckle up
Been a minute in the slumber, I finally toughened up but
[Pre-Chorus]
Damn, 3AM and I'm wide awake
Nothing changes pack it up, and just drive away
Sick and tired of this every day hideaway
This every day hideaway

Been a little hazy lately, but I stay alive
Come take a dive, inside my head
Feeling down but never out, I'm hanging by a thread12Embed Stay Solace iamjakehill sad
