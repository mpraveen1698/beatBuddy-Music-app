2 ContributorsEmotionless Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know I should put down my phone
But I'm not used to being alone
I'll be drunk in an hour or so
'Cause that's how I cope
I think that I'm feeling too much
Every thought leads back to us
Can only hate someone you love
And now that we're done

[Chorus]
I wanna be emotionless
I wanna feel emotions less
You're out of my bed
So get out of my head
I-I-I-I-I
I wanna be, wanna be… fine

[Verse 2]
I think that I'm losing myself
And drowning in feelings I've held
On for too long and it's hell
Can somebody help me?
I'm checking my pulse, tryna slow down my breath
It's been a few weeks now and I'm still a mess
Being stuck on somebody who doеsn't even want me
Baby, sеt me free
I wanna be, wanna be

Emotionless
I wanna feel emotions less
You're out of my bed
So get out of my head
I-I-I-I-I
I wanna be, wanna be

[Outro]
Emotionless, I wanna feel emotions less
Emotionless, I wanna feel emotions less
Emotionless, I wanna feel emotions less
Emotionless, I-I-I-I-I
I wanna be, wanna be… fineEmbed Emotionless Emotionless Ashley Kutcher songwriter
