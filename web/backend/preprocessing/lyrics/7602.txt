28 ContributorsBrand New Numb Lyrics[Intro]
("I'm tryna fuckin' record this")
("Sorry")

[Verse 1]
I've got a shotgun tongue
And tick like a time bomb
All black everything
I've got a switchblade wit
That cuts like a bitch
And I think you two should meet (Oh, hello)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna break free from my humanity
I wanna release the animal in me
B-b-b-break free your curiosity
You're gonna give me what I need

[Chorus]
I've got blood on my hands, no guilt on my conscience
The war in your path, the sex in your violence
All of my flaws, I wear 'em with honor
A purple heartbreak for all we've suffered

[Post-Chorus]
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
(Here to save the day)
I'll be the enemy
E-e-e-enemy
I'll be the enemy
Enemy, enemy

[Verse 2]
I'm in your blind spot
God while I get your rocks off
Worship to the beat
I wanna thank you, come again
That was great, do you need a receipt?

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna break free from my humanity
I wanna release the darker side of me
B-b-b-break free your curiosity
You're gonna give me what I need

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've still got blood on my hands, no guilt on my conscience
The war in your path, the sex in your violence
All of my flaws, I wear 'em with honor
A purple heartbreak for all we've suffered

[Post-Chorus]
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
Here to save the day
I'll be the enemy
E-e-e-enemy
I'll be the enemy
Enemy, enemy
[Refrain]
I got a brand new
I got a brand new
I got a brand new
Brand new numb
I got a brand new
I got a brand new
I got a brand new
Brand new numb

[Bridge]
Give me liberty or death
Charge me more and pay me less
I said give me liberty or death
Ah, fuck it, just give me death
Let's go!
Yeah!
This one's for the underdogs

[Chorus]
I've got blood on my hands, no guilt on my conscience
The war in your path, your mind is the target
All of my flaws, I wear 'em with honor
A purple heartbreak for all we've suffered

[Post-Chorus]
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
(Brand new numb)
I'll be the enemy
E-e-e-enemy
I'll be the enemy
