I'm hungry like a wolf
I bleed like a wolf

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm lost and I'm lonely
I hunger for you only
Don't leave me now, don't break the spell
In heaven, lost my taste for hell

[Chorus]
Taste for hell
Taste for hell
Mm, mm

[Verse 2]
I'm hunted like a wolf
I feed, I feed like a wolf

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm lost and I'm lonely
I hunger for you only
Don't leave me now, don't break the spell
In heaven, lost my taste for hell

[Chorus]
Taste for hell
Taste for hell
Oh, oh
