Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Gotta lotta half-finished novels on my nightstand
Wanna see the world, but I don't plan
Head up in the clouds and I can't land
Running out of minutes on my left hand
Gotta lot of friends that I don't see
Say a lot of things that I don't mean
No, I'm not one to lie
Pushing my ego aside

[Chorus]
What if I'm tryna better myself?
Feeling kinda unwell
How much will I lose
Before I learn to
Before I learn to
Break the habits I know?
Before I end up alone
How much will I lose
Before I learn to
Before I learn to follow through?

I've been tryna get some rest, but I don't sleep
Digging through the couch for my car keys
Looking for the door, but I can't leave (Can't leave)
Could someone pull me out of this daydream?
I know every moment is a new chance
To find somebody real enough to slow dance 'til the morning
If that's what we
That's what we do
Then I'll do my best to follow through

[Interlude]
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
What if I'm tryna better myself?
Feeling kinda unwell
How much will I lose
Before I learn to
Before I learn to
Break the habits I know?
Before I end up alone
How much will I lose
Before I learn to
Before I learn to follow through?
