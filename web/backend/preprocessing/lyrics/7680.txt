Well, if you want to sing out, sing out
And if you want to be free, be free
'Cause there's a million things to be
You know that there are

[Verse 2]
And if you want to live high, live high
And if you want to live low, live low
'Cause there's a million ways to go
You know that there are

[Chorus]
You can do what you want, the opportunity's on
And if you find a new way, you can do it today
You can make it all true and you can make it undo
You see, it's easy, you only need to know

[Verse 3]
Well, if you want to say yes, say yes
And if you want to say no, say no
'Cause there's a million ways to go
You know that there are

[Verse 4]
And if you want to be me, be me
And if you want to be you, be you
'Cause there's a million things to do
You know that there are

You can do what you want, the opportunity's on
And if you find a new way, you can do it today

[Verse 1]
Well, if you want to sing out, sing out
And if you want to be free, be free
'Cause there's a million things to be
You know that there are

[Outro]
You know that there are
You know that there are
You know that there are
You know that there are
You know that there are2Embed If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out Tea For The Tillerman (Super Deluxe) Yusuf / Cat Stevens british
