This is a certified hood classic
Kill myself
My life is goin' nowhere
I want everyone to know that I—

[Chorus]
I used to wanna kill myself
Came up, still wanna kill myself
My life is goin' nowhere
I want everyone to know that I don't care
I used to wanna kill myself
Came up, still wanna kill myself
My life is goin' nowhere
I want everyone to know that I don't care

[Refrain]
Baby girl, you got nothing on her
You're the only one that could ever compare
I can't hear what you're tryin' to say
Club lights shining on the side of your face

[Verse]
Cocaine love, it goes straight to your brain
Why the fuck is everybody the same?
Fuck my life, tell that bitch I'm insane
Lil Peep shawty, let me silence your pain
You might also like[Chorus]
I used to wanna kill myself
Came up, still wanna kill myself
My life is goin' nowhere
I want everyone to know that I don't care
I used to wanna kill myself
Came up, still wanna kill myself
My life is goin' nowhere
I want everyone to know that I don't care

[Refrain]
Baby girl, you got nothing on her
You're the only one that could ever compare
I can't hear what you're tryin' to say
Club lights shining on the side of your face72Embed OMFG HELLBOY Lil Peep emo
