20 ContributorsAngel Lyrics[Verse 1]
I’m in love with an angel, heaven forbid
Made me a believer with the touch of her skin
I’d go to hell and back with you
Stay lost in what we found
Worlds apart we were the same
Until we hit the ground

[Chorus]
Maybe I’m crazy, maybe I’m weak
Maybe I’m blinded by what I see
You wanted a soldier but it wasn't me
Cause I could never set you free
So fly on your own
It’s time I let you go
Go go

[Verse 2]
I’m in love with an angel who’s afraid of the light
Her halo is broken but there's fight in her eyes

[Bridge]
Walls are built to keep us safe
Until they’re crashing down
Worlds apart we were the same
Until you hit the ground

Maybe I’m crazy, maybe I’m weak
Maybe I’m blinded by what I see
You wanted a soldier but it wasn't me
Cause I could never set you free
So fly on your own
It’s time I let you go
Go go

[Bridge]
Walls are built to keep us safe
Until they’re crashing down
Worlds apart we were the same
Until you hit the ground

[Chorus]
Maybe I’m crazy, maybe I’m weak
Maybe I’m blinded by what I see
You wanted a soldier but it wasn't me
Cause I could never set you free
So fly on your own
It’s time I let you go
So fly on your own
It’s time I let you go
Go go12Embed Angel Savages Theory of a Deadman grunge
