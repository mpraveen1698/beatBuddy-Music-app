Never was a leader
Never had a thing for fairytales
Not really a believer
No, no
Small voice in the choir
Guess I never dared to know myself
Kept my heart beat quiet, no

[Pre-Chorus]
But then there was you (But then there was you)
Yeah, then there was you, pull me out of the crowd
You were telling the truth (You were telling the truth)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I got something to say now
'Cause you tell me that there's no way I couldn't go
Nothing I couldn't do
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I want to get louder
I got to get louder
We're 'bout to go up, baby, up we go
We're 'bout to go up, baby, up we go
We're blowing up speakers
Our heart a little clearer
We're 'bout to go up, baby, up we go
We're 'bout to go up, baby, up we go
For worse or for better
Gonna give it to you
In capital letters

We put a crack in the shadows (Oh)
And you tell me it's okay to be the light
And not to swim in the shallows
No, no
And I wanna get drunk with you
When we lie so still, but you're taking me places
Holding me onto you
And we don't care who's watching us, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Then there was you (But then there was you)
Yeah, then there was you, pull me out of the crowd
You were telling the truth (You were telling the truth)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I got something to say now
'Cause you tell me that there's no way I couldn't go
Nothing I couldn't do (No, no)
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I want to get louder
I got to get louder
We're 'bout to go up, baby, up we go
We're 'bout to go up, baby, up we go
We're blowing up speakers
Our heart a little clearer
We're 'bout to go up, baby, up we go
We're 'bout to go up, baby, up we go
For worse or for better
Gonna give it to you (Oh)
In capital letters
[Bridge]
Ooh, oh
In capital letters
In capital
Gonna give it to you, gonna give it to you, gonna give it to you

[Chorus]
I want to get louder
I got to get louder
We 'bout to go up baby, up we go
We 'bout to go up baby, up we go
We're blowing up speakers
Our heart a little clearer
We 'bout to go up baby, up we go
We 'bout to go up baby, up we go
I want to get louder
I got to get louder
We're 'bout to go up, baby, up we go
We're 'bout to go up, baby, up we go
We're blowing up speakers
Our heart a little clearer
We're 'bout to go up, baby, up we go
We're 'bout to go up, baby, up we go
For worse or for better
Gonna give it to you
