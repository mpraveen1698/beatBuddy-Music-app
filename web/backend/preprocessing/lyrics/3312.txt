Can't stay at home, can't stay in school
Old folks say, "You poor little fool"
Down the street, I'm the girl next door
I'm the fox you've been waiting for

[Chorus]
Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch, cherry bomb
Hello, world, I'm your wild girl
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch, cherry bomb

[Verse 2]
Stone Age love and strange sounds too
Come on, baby, let me get to you
Bad nights causin' teenage blues
Get down, ladies, you got nothin' to lose

[Chorus]
Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch, cherry bomb
Hello, world, I'm your wild girl
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch, cherry bomb

[Guitar Solo]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh!

Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch, cherry bomb
Hello, world, I'm your wild girl
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch, cherry bomb
Oh-ah

[Verse 3]
Hey, street boy, want some style?
Your dead-end dreams don't make you smile
I'll give you somethin' to live for
Have you and grab you 'til you're sore

[Chorus]
Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch, cherry bomb
Hello, world, I'm your wild girl
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch, cherry bomb
