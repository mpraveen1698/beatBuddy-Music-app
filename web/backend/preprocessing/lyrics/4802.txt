11 ContributorsHotel Lyrics[Verse 1]
I keep a lot of secrets to myself
My parents think I'm honest, not like everyone else
Like they could catch me in a lie, they say they're able to tell
But I'm partying with my friends at some random hotel

[Pre-Chorus]
And sneaking out the window on a Sunday night
I'd do it on a Friday, but that's obvious, I
Don't wanna lose my trust, but I do it so well
'Cause I'm partying with my friends at some random hotel

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's a little fun, stupid, and like really dumb
Pop six pieces of gum before I get home
'Cause we do it so well, yeah, no, they'll never tell
And we're driving a little fast, P.C.H. wasted my gas
Eating pasta in the back, spilling our minds out
Wish our secrets farewell, they stay in this random hotel

[Verse 2]
Screaming out songs like there's nobody there
We're 17 and idiots who play truth or dare
One day I'll write a story that'll sit on a shelf
About me partying with my friends at some random hotel

And sneaking out the window on a Sunday night
I'd do it on a Friday, but that's obvious, I
Don't wanna lose my trust, but I do it so well
'Cause I'm partying with my friends at some random hotel

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's a little fun, stupid, and like really dumb
Pop six pieces of gum before I get home
'Cause we do it so well, yeah, no, they'll never tell
And we're driving a little fast, P.C.H. wasted my gas
Eating pasta in the back, spilling our minds out
Wish our secrets farewell, they stay in this random hotel

[Outro]
'Cause we do it so well, yeah, no, they'll never tell
Wish our secrets farewell, they stay in this random hotel3Embed Hotel 6 Of A Billion Claire Rosinkranz indie-pop
