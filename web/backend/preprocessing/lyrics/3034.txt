Mmm, mmm-mmm

[Verse 1: Noah Cyrus, PJ Harding]
Slowly, why's the morning come so slowly
When I got no one to hold me through the dark?
Patient, they tell me that love is patient
But it never wants to wait on my drunk heart

[Pre-Chorus: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus]
So I'll take all of my, all of my, all of my wasted love
And turn it into wine, into wine, into wine in my cup, woah

[Chorus: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus, PJ Harding]
Dear August, tell me that there's light
At the end of all this starless night
Dear August, please don't let me fall
'Cause I don't know where this road is headed anymore

[Verse 2: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus]
Fading, now the summer heat is fading
I spend every evening praying for the dawn
Save me, looking for someone to save me
Give me everything you gave me, but your scorn

[Pre-Chorus: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus]
So I'll take all of my, all of my, all of my wasted love
And turn it into wine, into wine, into wine in my cup, woah

[Bridge: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus, PJ Harding]
Oh, dear August (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, August
Oh, no, no, no, dear August (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, August
Ah

[Chorus: PJ Harding & Noah Cyrus]
Dear August, tell me that there's light
At the end of all this starless night
Dear August, please don't let me fall
'Cause I don't know where this road is headed anymore2Embed Dear August Dear August PJ Harding;Noah Cyrus singer-songwriter
