Take me down the highway
Back to Dallas, Dallas

Wake me up in Rio
Baby we’ve got so much left
To see oh, see oh

When we wake up, don’t stop dreaming
Keep your faith, don’t stop believing
All our sins will be forgiven
Baby wake me up in heaven

Baby wake me up in

Wake me up in Paris
Take me down the highway
Back to Dallas, Dallas

Wake me up in Rio
Baby we’ve got so much left
To see oh, see oh

When we wake up, don’t stop dreaming
Keep your faith, don’t stop believing
All our sins will be forgiven
