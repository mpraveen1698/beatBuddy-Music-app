6 Contributorsâ€‹could you love me while i hate myself LyricsCould you love me while I hate myself?
Could you love me though I don't deserve it?
Could you love me like there's no one else
Even though you know I can't return it?

Could you love me when the water's rough
Or when I leave you in a desert?
Could you love me though I speak with knives
Knowing all too well that you'll get hurt?

If you can't answer yes, just go, I'm
More trouble than I'm worth

Could you love me while I hate myself?
Because I don't know how this works
I never learned how this worksYou might also likeEmbed could you love me while i hate myself scared of everything Zeph singer-songwriter
