When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold
Lost my hold to the shadows of the night

[Chorus]
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark

[Verse 2]
Do your demons
Do they ever let you go?
When you try do they hide deep inside?
Is it someone that you know?
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie
You and I we're words without a rhyme
You might also like[Chorus]
There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeah

[Verse 3]
When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear
And you'll hear it calling you, beware
Look out!

[Outro]
There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
Like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah, yeah
You're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark
