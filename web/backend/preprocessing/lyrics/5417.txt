Look how she lights up the sky
Ma belle Evangeline
So far above me, yet I
Know her heart belongs to only me

J'tadore, J'taime, Evangeline
You're my queen of the night
So still, so bright

To someone as beautiful as she
Who loves someone like me
Love always finds a way, it's true
And I love you, Evangeline
Oooh, yeah!

Love is beautiful, love is wonderful
Love is everything, do you agree?
Mais oui!

Look how she lights up the sky
I love you, EvangelineYou might also like1Embed Ma Belle Evangeline The Princess and the Frog (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Jim Cummings;Terence Blanchard children
