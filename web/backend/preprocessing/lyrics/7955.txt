Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay

[Verse 1]
At the starting line, a never-ending race
What I've got inside isn't commonplace
I've been dreaming 'bout hope for better days
Time for dreaming's done, time to face the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
(Flying high above the world)
It's a new life, it's a new mind
And I will never fall

[Chorus]
(The time is now)
I can't contain myself, I've never felt so alive
(The time is now)
I'm past the breaking point, I set my soul on fire
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
(The time is now)
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
(The time is now)

I cannot stop, see another way
Am I looking for another cheap escape?
I've been pushing forward, crushing everything
It's a push-and-pull, it's a give-and-take

[Pre-Chorus]
(Flying high above)
And it's a new life, it's a new mind
And I will never fall

[Chorus]
(The time is now)
I can't contain myself, I've never felt so alive
(The time is now)
I'm past the breaking point, I set my soul on fire
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
(The time is now)
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
(The time is now)

[Breakdown]
Now (Hey, hey)
Now (Hey, hey)
Now (Hey, hey)
Now (Hey, hey)
[Refrain]
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay

[Chorus]
(The time is now)
I can't contain myself, I've never felt so alive

I'm past the breaking point, I've set my soul on fire
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
(The time is now)
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
