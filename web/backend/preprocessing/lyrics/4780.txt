Is it just me? (Ooh)
Is it just me?

[Verse 1: Sasha Sloan & Charlie Puth]
I hate holdin' babies
And people tryna save me
Think religion is a business
Where you pay for God's forgiveness
Modern art is boring
Politicians are annoying
I don't think love lasts forever
And old music was better

[Pre-Chorus: Sasha Sloan & Charlie Puth]
Am I just high
Or am I kinda right?

[Chorus: Sasha Sloan, Sasha Sloan & Charlie Puth]
Is it just me
Or does anybody
Feel the way that I feel?
They're just not bein' real
Tell me, is it just me
Or is anybody
Thinkin' all the same shit?
They're just not sayin' it
Or is it just me?

[Verse 2: Sasha Sloan & Charlie Puth]
Weddings are outdated
Thе show Friends was overrated
I think rich kids havе it easy
And PDA is creepy
The internet's obnoxious
People my age make me nauseous
I think marijuana's classy
And doing coke is trashy

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth, Sasha Sloan & Charlie Puth, Sasha Sloan]
Am I just high
Or am I kinda right? (I'm kinda right)

[Chorus: Sasha Sloan & Charlie Puth, Sasha Sloan & Charlie Puth]
Is it just me
Or does anybody
Feel the way that I feel?
They're just not bein' real
Tell me, is it just me
Or is anybody
Thinkin' all the same shit? (All the same shit)
They're just not sayin' it (Just not sayin' it)
Or is it just me?
[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth, Sasha Sloan]
(Is it just me?)
Is it just me?
(Is it just me?)

[Outro: Sasha Sloan & Charlie Puth, Sasha Sloan]
I should probably bite my tongue, but
I can't be the only one, yeah
I should probably bite my tongue, but
I can't be the only one2Embed Is It Just Me? (feat. Charlie Puth) Is It Just Me? (feat. Charlie Puth) Sasha Alex Sloan;Charlie Puth electro
