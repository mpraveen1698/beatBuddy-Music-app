The party's nearly over
We sat there on the sofa
Kinda close but getting closer
I know that you gotta go, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna say goodbye
It's been so long since I
Stayed up late at night
With someone that I like

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be smiling all the way back home
Smiling all the way back home
I'm gonna be smiling all the way, smiling all the way
Smiling all the way back home

[Verse 2]
We're on the street now, we're stalling
Uber driver keeps calling
You say to me, "Just ignore him"
4:45 AM in the morning

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna say goodbye
It's been so long since I
Stayed up late at night
With someone that I like

Stayed up late at night
With someone that I like
