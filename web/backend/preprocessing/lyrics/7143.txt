3 Contributors2 Die 4 (Jax Jones Midnight Snacks Remix) Lyrics[Chorus]
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights and making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world go less blue, let's do it over again
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights and making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world go lеss blue, let's do it over again

Look alivе and come with me, you're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights and making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world go less blue, let's do it over again
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights and making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world go less blue, let's do it over again

[Outro]
Look alive and come with me
Look alive and come with me
Look alive and come with me
Look alive and come with meYou might also likeEmbed 2 Die 4 (Jax Jones Midnight Snacks Remix) 2 Die 4 (Jax Jones Midnight Snacks Remix) Tove Lo;Jax Jones swedish
