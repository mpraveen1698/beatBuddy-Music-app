I love you too much
To live without you loving me back
I love you too much
Heaven's my witness and this is a fact

[Chorus]
I know I belong
When I sing this song
There's love above love and it's ours
'Cause I love you too much

[Verse 2]
I live for your touch
I whisper your name night after night
I love you too much
There's only one feeling and I know its right

[Chorus]
I know I belong
When I sing this song
There's love above love and it's ours
'Cause I love you too much

[Bridge]
Heaven knows your name, I've been praying
To have you come here by my side
Without you a part of me is missing
Just to make you my whole I will fight
You might also like[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know I belong
When I sing this song
There's love above love and it's ours
Cause I love you too much

[Verse 3]
I love you too much
I love you too much
Heaven's my witness and this is a fact
You live in my soul
Your heart is my goal

[Outro]
There's love above love and its mine 'cause I love you
There's love above love and it's yours 'cause I love you
There's love above love and it's ours if you love me as much3Embed I Love You Too Much The Book of Life (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Gustavo Santaolalla;Diego Luna ambient
