Long ago, just like the Hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you
Burning on, just like a match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know

[Pre-Chorus]
And what's the worst to take (Worst to take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

[Chorus]
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So love your good night

[Verse 2]
Came a time when every star fall brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold

[Pre-Chorus]
And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long, and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So love your good night

[Bridge]
Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend to leave, and then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide?

[Chorus]
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long, and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So love your good night100Embed Helena Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge My Chemical Romance punk
