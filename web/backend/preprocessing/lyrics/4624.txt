[Verso 1: Sebastián Yatra & Isabela Moner]
I remember when I met you
I didn't want to fall
I felt my hands were shaking 'cause you looked so beautiful
I remember when you kissed me
I knew you were the one
And oh my hands were shaking when you played my favorite song

[Pre-Coro: Sebastián Yatra & Isabela Moner, Sebastián Yatra]
I don't know why, but every time I look into your eyes
I see a thousand falling shooting stars and yes I love you
I can't believe that every night you're by my side

[Coro: Sebastián Yatra & Isabela Moner]
Promise I'll stay here 'til the morning
And pick you up when you're falling
When the rain gets rough, when you've had enough
I'll just sweep you off your feet and fix you with my love
My only one
My only one

[Verso 2: Sebastián Yatra & Isabela Moner]
Tell me how you do it
I can barely breathe with the smile you get
You get the best of me and all I really want is to give you all of me
Tell me how you do it
How you bring me back
You bring me back to life then make my heartbeat stop, I can't take it

I don't know why, but every time I look into your eyes
I see a thousand falling shooting stars and yes I love you
I can't believe that every night you're by my side

[Coro: Sebastián Yatra & Isabela Moner, Isabela Moner & Sebastián Yatra]
Voy a cuidarte por las noches
Voy a amarte sin reproches
Te voy a extrañar en la tempestad
Y aunque existan mil razones para renunciar
Promise I'll stay here 'til the morning
And pick you up when you're falling
When the rain gets rough, when you've had enough
I'll just sweep you off your feet and fix you with my love
My only one, there's no one else
My only one, there's no one else
You are my only one
It's just there's no one else, ouh, uoh
My only one
