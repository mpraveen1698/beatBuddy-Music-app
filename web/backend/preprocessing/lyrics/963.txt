75 ContributorsMonster Lyrics[Verse 1]
The secret side of me
I never let you see
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
So stay away from me
The beast is ugly
I feel the rage, and I just can't hold it
It's scratching on the walls
In the closet, in the halls
It comes awake, and I can't control it
Hiding under the bed
In my body, in my head
Why won't somebody come and save me from this?
Make it end!

[Chorus]
I feel it deep within!
It's just beneath the skin!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I hate what I've become!
The nightmare's just begun!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!

[Verse 2]
My secret side I keep
Hid under lock and key
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out
He'll tear me up, break me down
Why won't somebody come and save me from this?
Make it end!

I, I feel like a monster!

[Bridge]
It's hiding in the dark!
Its teeth are razor-sharp!
There's no escape for me, it wants my soul, it wants my heart
No one can hear me scream
Maybe it's just a dream
Maybe it's inside of me
Stop this monster!
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster

[Chorus]
I hate what I've become!
The nightmare's just begun!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I feel it deep within!
It's just beneath the skin!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I’m gonna lose control!
It’s something radical!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!71Embed Monster Awake Skillet rock
