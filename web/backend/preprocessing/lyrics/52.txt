Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need (Ooh-ooh)
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives (Ooh-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?

[Chorus]
I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

[Verse 2]
Playin' with a stick of dynamitе
There was nevеr gray in black and white
There was never wrong 'til there was right (Ooh-ooh)
Feelin' like a boulder hurtlin'
Seein' all the vultures circlin'
Burnin' in the flames, I'm workin' in
Turnin' in a bed, that's darkenin'

'Cause there's magic in my bones

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause there's magic in my bones

[Bridge]
Look in the mirror of my mind
Turnin' the pages of my life
Walkin' the path so many paced a million times
Drown out the voices in the air
Leavin' the ones that never cared
Pickin' the pieces up and buildin' to the sky

[Pre-Chorus]

I-I-I got this feeling in my soul (Soul)
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

[Outro]
There goes my mind, (I-I-I) don't mind
There goes my mind (There it goes, there it goes)
There goes my mind, (I-I-I) don't mind
There goes my mind (There it goes)
