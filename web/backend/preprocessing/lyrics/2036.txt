60 ContributorsJackie Chan Lyrics[Chorus: Post Malone]
She say she's too young, don't want no man
So she gon' call her friends, now that's a plan
I just ordered sushi from Japan
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan

[Verse 1: Preme]
Drop top, how we rollin' down on Collins South Beach (Yeah)
Look like Kelly Rowland, this might be my destiny (Yeah)
She want me to eat it, I guess dinner's on me (I got you, babe)
Know I got the sauce like a fuckin' recipe (Ohh)
She just wanna do it for the 'Gram (You know, you know)
She just want this money in my hand (I know, you know)
I'ma give it to her when she dance, dance, dance (Ayy)
She gon' catch an Uber out to Calabasas

[Chorus: Post Malone]
She say she's too young, don't want no man
So she gon' call her friends, now that's a plan
I just ordered sushi from Japan
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan
She say she's too young, don't want no man
So she gon' call her friends, now that's a plan
I just ordered sushi from Japan
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan
Now your bitch wanna kick it, Jackie Chan

I think you got the wrong impression 'bout me, baby ('Bout me, baby)
Just 'cause they heard what hood I’m from they think I'm crazy (They think I'm crazy)
Okay, well maybe just a little crazy (Just a little)
'Cause I admit I'm crazy 'bout that lady, yeah (Oh)
Finger to the world, it's fuck you, pay me (I been slavin')
Run the pussy 'cause I'm runnin' out of patience
No more waitin' no, no (Ayy)
Bouncin' like a yo-yo (Ayy)
Livin' life on fast forward but we fuck in slow mo', yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
She say she's too young, don't want no man
So she gon' call her friends, now that's a plan
I just ordered sushi from Japan

She say she's too young, don't want no man
So she gon' call her friends, now that's a plan

[Bridge: Post Malone]
I can't wait for the show, oh, oh
Got that good, yeah, I know, oh, oh
You should not be alone, oh, oh
All this drink got me throwed, oh, oh
Club got me right
And I feel so alive (Ayy)
She don't want a thing
She don't wanna be no wife (Ayy)
She just wanna stay all night
She just wanna sniff the white (Ayy)
Can't tell her nothing, no
Can't tell her nothing, no

She say she's too young, don't want no man
So she gon' call her friends, now that's a plan
I just ordered sushi from Japan
