7 ContributorsEase Off Lyrics[Intro]
Woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Fucking model hoes
Wearin' thousand dollar clothes
Sleepin' in my bed with bitches that I barely know
I got these problems of my own
Habits set in stone
Said I'll see you in the morning then she wake up and I'm gone

[Chorus]
And I'm just east side, pushing a whip fast and feeling it
She called, told me these love songs are remedy
Ease off, baby, just ease off, you're killing me
Ease off, baby, just ease off, you're killing me

[Verse]
Girl, you're killing me
Girl, you're really killing me
I been here for seven days and nights and that shit get to me
This ain't how it meant to be
Girl, you drain my energy
Stumbling around, it's got me askin' if we meant to be
I'm off one, baby, I'm off one
Tell me, is this love or does this lead to a coffin?
Sippin' straight off the rocks
So I said pour me a shot
Said I been livin' with this feeling that I'm breakin' your heart
'Cause I been

Habits set in stone

[Chorus]
And I'm just east side, pushing a whip fast and feeling it
She called, told me these love songs are remedy
Ease off, baby, just ease off, you're killing me
Ease off, baby, just ease off, you're killing me

[Interlude]
I just really wish you could understand how this makes me feel
Ever since you moved you've become a completely different person and I hate it
I, I just, I don't get you
Are you even listening to me?
(Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Fucking model hoes
Wearin' thousand dollar clothes
Sleepin' in my bed with bitches that I barely know
I got these problems of my own
Habits set in stone
Said I'll see you in the morning then she wake up and I'm gone
[Chorus]
And I'm just east side, pushing a whip fast and feeling it
She called, told me these love songs are remedy
Ease off, baby, just ease off, you're killing me
Ease off, baby, just ease off, you're killing me2Embed Ease Off Ease Off YNG Martyr sad
