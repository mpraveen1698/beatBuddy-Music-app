Uh!

I'm gonna get free
I'm gonna get free

Ride into the sun
She never loved me
She never loved me
She never loved me
Why should anyone?

(Come here, come here, come here)
I'll take your photo for ya

Drive you around the corner

You know you really oughta
(Come here, come here, come here)
Move outta California
