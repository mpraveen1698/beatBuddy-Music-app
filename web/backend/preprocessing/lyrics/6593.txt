The demon queen of high school has decreed it:
She says Monday, 8 a.m., I will be deleted
They'll hunt me down in study hall
Stuff and mount me on the wall
Thirty hours to live—
How shall I spend them?

I don't have to stay and die like cattle
I could change my name and ride up to Seattle
But I don't own a motorbike
Wait—here's an option that I like:
Spend these thirty hours gettin' freakay!
Yeah!

I need it hard
I'm a dead girl walkin'
I'm in your yard
I'm a dead girl walkin'
Before they punch my clock
I'm snappin' off your window lock
Got no time to knock
I'm a dead girl walking

[J.D., spoken]
Veronica? What are you doing in my room?

Shh...

Sorry, but I really had to wake you
See, I decided I must ride you till I break you
'Cause Heather says I gots to go
You're my last meal on death row
Shut your mouth and lose them tighty-whities!
Come on! Tonight I'm yours
I'm your dead girl walkin'
Get on all fours
Kiss this dead girl walkin'
Let's go, you know the drill
I'm hot and pissed and on the pill
Bow down to the will of a dead girl walking!
And you know, you know, you know
It's 'cause you're beautiful
You say you're numb inside
But I can't agree
So the world's unfair
Keep it locked out there
In here it's beautiful
Let's make this beautiful!
[J.D.]
That works for me! Whoop-
[Instrumental/Guitar Lead]

[VERONICA]
Yeah!
Full steam ahead!
Take this dead girl walkin'

[J.D.]
How'd you find my address?

[VERONICA]
Let's break the bed
Rock this dead girl walkin'!

[J.D.]
I think you tore my mattress!

[Veronica]
No sleep tonight for you
Better chug that Mountain Dew

[J.D.]
Okay, okay
[VERONICA]
Get your ass in gear
Make this whole town disappear!

[J.D.]
Okay, okay!
[VERONICA]
Slap me! Pull my hair!
Touch me

[VERONICA & J.D.]
There and there and there!

[Veronica]
And no more talkin'

[J.D.]
No-oh-oh-oh!

[Veronica]
Love this dead girl walkin'

[J.D.]
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! Yeah, yeah!

[VERONICA with J.D.]
Love this dead girl walking

[J.D.]
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! Wait, wait!

[VERONICA & J.D.]
Love this dead girl
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

[J.D.]
Ow!
