21 ContributorsDon’t Look Back Into the Sun LyricsYeah!
Don’t look back into the sun
Now you know that the time is come
And they said it would never come for you oh oh oh oh
Oh my friend you haven’t changed
You're looking rough and living strange
And I know you got a taste for it too oh oh oh
They'll never forgive you but they won't let you go (oh no)
She'll never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no!

Don't look back into the sun
You've cast your pearls but you're on the run
And all the lies you said, who did you save?

And then they played that song at the Death Disco
It started fast but it ends so slow
And all the time just reminded me of you

They'll never forgive you but they won't let you go (let me go!)
She'll never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no!

They'll never forgive you but they won't let you go (let me go!)
She'll never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no!See The Libertines LiveGet tickets as low as $75You might also like2Embed Don't Look Back into the Sun Don't Look Back into the Sun The Libertines garage
