45 ContributorsSports Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you feel lonely
I could be lonely with you
Tell me, baby
Why do you seem so blue?

[Pre-Chorus]
Why are we so complicated?
Maybe love is overrated

[Chorus]
I'm tired of waitin'
I was never good at sports
Save the games for the girls on the tennis court
Say you need me
But lately, you feel unsure
Come on to me, come on to me
I need more
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
If you feel broken
Promise I won't break your heart
If you shatter
I won't let you fall apart
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Why are we so complicated?
Love's a word I've always hated

[Chorus]
I'm tired of waitin'
I was never good at sports
Save the games for the girls on the tennis court
Say you need me
But lately, you feel unsure
Come on to me, come on to me
I need more

[Outro]
It always feels like
I need more
Jesus Christ, you're so confusing
If we keep score
Bet my money that I'm losing22Embed Sports Sports Beach Bunny indie-pop
