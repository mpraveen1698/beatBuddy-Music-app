5 ContributorsBlue Spirits Lyrics[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I got a rush in my head right now
I've been fiending with my friends around
We're just running from a lonely town, oh
This new girl's face gave me a lot of faith, it's true
If you could hear my doubts, they got a soul to save
Wonder if my heart gave out 'cause I can't live without

[Chorus]
Wasted nights
Falling again so you can take me high
I'm happy with all of my friends
We're slowly burning like cigarettes
One more time
Remind me just how it feels to feel alive
We sleep in and stay up all night
And talk about dying

[Verse 2]
If I die because I lost my drive
At least it was a prеtty ride
Falling for you every timе (I'll fall)
'Cause no one knows
Checking my wrist if the time run low
Money's well gone, but my ex still calls
Head to my heart and ten of my toes
Fall in love, let her watch me burn out
Call my bluff and I'm losing her now
All I really want is
You might also like[Chorus]
Wasted nights
Falling again so you can take me high
I'm happy with all of my friends
We're slowly burning like cigarettes
One more time
Remind me just how it feels to feel alive
We sleep in and stay up all night
And talk about dying

[Bridge]
I played my parts
Heartbreak had good intentions
Drown it out
With loud bass and your attention
All I need, all I need

[Chorus]
Wasted nights
Falling again so you can take me high
I'm happy with all of my friends
We're slowly burning like cigarettesEmbed Blue Spirits Blue Spirits DWLLRS chill
