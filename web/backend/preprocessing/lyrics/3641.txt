Ha-ah, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ah, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1]
Oh, don't I look nice batting my eyes?
Isn't it pure perfection?
Cute, think I'm polite, stereotype
Got your full attention
Think that you can play with me, you better watch your back
The last thing that you'll hear will be my laugh (Haha, yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, dolls kill
Don't provoke us or we will
Push you downhill
Might be pretty, but we're still
Bitter as much as we're sweet
Knife hidden under the sheets
Baby, dolls kill
Don't provoke us or we will (Go)

[Post-Chorus]
-voke us or we'll
Pretty, but we're (Still)

Heels, made out of steel, how does it feel
To bе walked all over?
Nails leaving a trail, got 'еm pigtails
Blood drips down your shoulder
Baby, there's power in numbers
Better warn all of your friends
You're down to less than an hour
We all know how this ends

[Chorus]
Dolls kill
Don't provoke us or we will
Push you downhill
Might be pretty, but we're still
Bitter as much as we're sweet
Knife hidden under the sheets
Baby, dolls kill
Don't provoke us or we will (Go)

[Post-Chorus]
-voke us or we'll
Pretty, but we're (Still)

[Bridge]
Sugar and spice and everything nice
No, that's not what we're made of
Venom and ice, tequila that bites
Go ahead and pray 'cause (Hahaha)
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, dolls kill
Don't provoke us or we will
Push you downhill
Might be pretty, but we're still
Bitter as much as we're sweet
Knife hidden under the sheets
Baby, dolls kill
Don't provoke us or we will4Embed Dolls Dolls Bella Poarch alternative
