22 ContributorsCollide Lyrics[Verse 1]
The dawn is breaking
A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you, yeah

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Verse 2]
But I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

[Chorus]
Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find you and I collide

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

I'm quiet, you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know
I'm always on your mind

[Chorus]
Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find you and I collide

[Bridge]
Don't stop here
I lost my place
I'm close behind

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Chorus]
Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find you and I collide
[Outro]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
You finally find you and I collide
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
You finally find you and I collide
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo20Embed Collide Stop All The World Now Howie Day acoustic
