10 ContributorsTorn to Pieces Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here I sit all alone like an airplane
On the edge of a sky full of solid gray
Staring at the ceiling
Tell me that I’m dreaming
Oh, I wish you were here today
All these days that I know I’ll never get back
All the words that I always wish you would’ve said
All these dreams that we had now fade to black
Try to wash it away

[Hook]
I’m torn to pieces, I’m broken down
I still see your face when you’re not around
I sit here in misery wondering if I’ll ever be
Half the man you wanted me to be

[Verse 2]
Here I float through the air like a waterfall
Then I sink to the bottom like a cannonball
Having trouble breathing, suddenly I’m screaming
"Why wasn’t I good enough?"
Even though I know you’re not gonna come back
I can’t wash it away

[Hook]x2

It’s tearing me to pieces
Tearing me to pieces
It’s tearing me to pieces
Tearing me to pieces

Even though I know you’re not coming back
I can’t wash it away

[Hook]

[Outro/Chorus]
I’m torn to pieces, I’m broken down
(I’m torn to pieces)
I still see your face when you’re not around
(I’m torn to pieces)
I sit here in misery wondering if I’ll ever be
Half the man you wanted me to be3Embed Torn to Pieces Onyx (Deluxe Edition) Pop Evil grunge
