14 ContributorsWar Eternal Lyrics[Verse 1]
Friend or foe? there's no way to know
Through the battlefield of life it's kill or be killed
So many times it's a matter of degree
From being up on your luck to down on your knees

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal

[Chorus]
They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They'd like to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are

[Verse 2]
It's times like these when lines are drawn
Which side of the fence are you standing on?
There will come a day not so far away
When the hunter becomes the prey
(And you will pay)

[Chorus]
They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They'd like to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are

[Bridge]
This is fucking war!

[Chorus]
They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They'd like to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are!2Embed War Eternal War Eternal Arch Enemy death-metal
