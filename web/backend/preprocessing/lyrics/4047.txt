It's hard for me to say the things I want to say sometimes
There's no one here but you and me and that broken old street light
Lock the doors, we'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you are these five words tonight

[Chorus]
Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes when I couldn't see
For parting my lips when I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me

[Verse 2]
I never knew I had a dream until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes, the sky's a different blue
Cross my heart, I wear no disguise
If I tried, you'd make believe that you believed my lies

[Chorus]
Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes when I couldn't see
For parting my lips when I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me

[Bridge]
You pick me up when I fall down
You ring the bell before they count me out
If I was drowning, you would part the sea
And risk your own life to rescue me, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Lock the doors, we'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you are these five words tonight

[Chorus]
Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes when I couldn't see
For parting my lips when I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
When I couldn't fly, oh, you gave me wings
You parted my lips when I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me

[Outro]
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me
