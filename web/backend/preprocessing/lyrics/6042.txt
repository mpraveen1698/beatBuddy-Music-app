Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh, what's becoming of me?

[Verse 2]
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what I mean?

[Refrain 1]
Gotta get away
Holy Diver
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you
Look out

[Verse 4]
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'til you see the light
Oh, we will pray it's all right

[Bridge]
Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel
The vision never dies
Life's a never ending wheel, yeah

[Verse 5]
Holy Diver
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid

[Verse 6]
Jump, jump
Jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen, yeah

[Verse 1]
Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh, what's becoming of me?
No! Yeah!
[Verse 2]
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what I mean?

[Refrain 3]
Gotta get away, get away (Get away)
Gotta get away, get away

[Outro]
Holy Diver, sole survivor
Your heart is clean
