17 ContributorsBrand New Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel like new sunglasses
Like a brand new pair of jeans
I feel like taking chances
I feel a lot like seventeen
I feel like windows rolled down
New city, streets, and cabs
I feel like anything can happen
Laughing, you take me right back
To when we were kids
Never thought I'd feel like this

[Chorus]
Like when I close my eyes
And don't even care if anyone sees me dancing
Like I can fly
And I don't even think I'm touching the ground
Like a heartbeat skip
Like an open page
Like a one-way trip on an aeroplane
It's the way that I feel when I'm with you
Brand new
Brand new

[Verse 2]
I feel like a young John Cusack
Like making big mistakes
I feel like for the first time in a long time I am not afraid
I feel like a kid
Never thought it'd feel like this

Like when I close my eyes
And don't even care if anyone sees me dancing
Like I can fly
And I don't even think I'm touching the ground
Like a heartbeat skip
Like an open page
Like a one-way trip on an aeroplane
It's the way that I feel when I'm with you
Brand new

[Bridge]
Time will always try to make us old
(Time will always try to make us old)
You remind me what I used to know
(Mmm)

[Chorus]
Like when I close my eyes
And don't even care if anyone sees me dancing
Like I can fly
And I don't even think I'm touching the ground (yeah)
Like a heartbeat skip
Like an open page
Like a one-way trip on an aeroplane
It's the way that I feel when I'm with you
Brand new
[Outro]
Brand new
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I feel, and I feel
And I feel brand new
I feel brand new
(It's the way that I feel when I'm with you)
I feel, I feel
