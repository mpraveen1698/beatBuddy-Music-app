4 ContributorsQueen Of Hearts Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your love's so mysterious
Sealed with a kiss
My words so delirious
From the venom on your lips

[Pre-Chorus]
You're begging me to stay
I should just walk away
Take this sword from my heart
Got me bleeding out
I'm not a player in your game

[Chorus]
I'm the Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts, my baby
Don't you change the cards
You change the cards, my baby
'Cause I tried and tried, but I'm moving on
And I love you and I love you, though you did me wrong
'Cause I'm the Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts, my baby

[Verse 2]
Never felt more and more alive
Now that you're gone
I was the best that you ever had
You're asking where it all went wrong
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You're begging me to stay
I should just walk away
Take this sword from my heart
Got me bleeding out
I'm not a player in your game

[Chorus]
I'm the Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts, my baby
Don't you change the cards
You change the cards, my baby
'Cause I tried and tried, but I'm moving on
And I love you and I love you, though you did me wrong
'Cause I'm the Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts, my baby

[Bridge]
You're begging me to stay
I should just walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
You're begging me to stay
I should just walk away
Take this sword from my heart
Got me bleeding out
I'm not a player in your game
[Chorus]
I'm the Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts, my baby
Don't you change the cards
You change the cards, my baby
'Cause I tried and tried, but I'm moving on
And I love you and I love you, though you did me wrong
'Cause I'm the Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts, my babyEmbed Queen of Hearts Queen of Hearts Starla Edney indie
