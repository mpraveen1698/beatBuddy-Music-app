I kn-kn-know a girl, she gets what she wants all the time
'Cause she's fine
But for an angel, she's a hot, hot mess
Make you so blind, but you don't mind

[Refrain]
'Cause she's an uptown, get-around, anything-goes girl, girl
She's a hardcore, candy-store, gimme-some-more girl, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
She'll make you take her to the club, but then she leaves with her friends
She likes to stay late at the party 'cause the fun never ends
And all her clothes are on the floor and all your records are scratched
She's like a one-way ticket 'cause you can't come back

[Chorus]
Saying, yeah, you want her, but she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)
Yeah, you want her, but she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)

[Verse 2]
You kn-kn-know that if you don't shut your mouth, she'll freak out (Oh)
You better get your shit together 'cause she's bringing you down now
Yeah, boy, you better, you better

'Cause she's an uptown, get-around, anything-goes girl, girl
She's a hardcore, candy-store, gimme-some-more girl, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
She's got a wicked sense of humor, can't believe what she says
She drinks Bacardi in the morning 'til it goes to her head
And all you want is just to hold her, but she don't go for that
She has a hard time coming when she can't hit back

[Chorus]
Saying, yeah, you want her, but she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)
Yeah, you want her, but she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)

[Bridge]
Every now and then, she makes you just a little bit crazy (Crazy)
She'll turn a knife into your back and then she's calling you "baby," crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
She'll make you take her to the club, but then she leaves with her friends
She likes to stay late at the party 'cause the fun never ends
And all her clothes are on the floor and all your records are scratched
She's like a one-way ticket 'cause you can't come back
[Chorus]
Saying, yeah, you want her, but she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)
Yeah, you want her, but she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)

[Outro]
(Yeah, you want her)
Yeah, man, I know how you want her (How you want her)
(Yeah, you want her)
Yeah, man, I know how you want her (How you want her)
Yeah, man, I know how you want her, but she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)4Embed She's so Mean North (Deluxe Edition) Matchbox Twenty grunge
