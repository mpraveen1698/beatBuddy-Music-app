Go!

[Verse 1]
Stapled shut, inside an outside world, and I'm
Sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
I'm claustrophobic, closing in
And I'm catastrophic, not again
I'm smeared across the page and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain, yet I'm the one who's obscene
Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
I've got no time to lose, I'm just caught up in all the cattle

[Pre-Chorus]
Fray the strings
Throw the shapes
Hold your breath
Listen!

[Chorus]
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!

I'm ripped across the ditch
And settled in the dirt and I
Wear you like a stitch
Yet I'm the one who's hurt
Pay attention to your
Twisted little indiscretions
I've got no right to win
I'm just caught up in all the battles

[Pre-Chorus]
Locked in clutch
Pushed in place
Hold your breath
Listen!

[Chorus]
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
[Bridge]
My end, it justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
The end of the road
And my end, it justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
The end of the road!

[Chorus]
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh!
