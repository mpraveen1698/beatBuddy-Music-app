1 ContributorDear Angie (Mono Mix) [2010 - Remaster] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dear Angie
Just these lines to confirm
Something you may know
Dear Angie
Please excuse the writing
It's my nerves you know

[Bridge 1]
When you caught your train today
You took my heart and soul away
I can't wait till Friday night
To see you, touch you, hold you tight

[Verse 2]
Dear Angie
How's your folks and relatives?
I hope they're well
Dear Angie
I'm spending my vacation
At that same hotel

[Bridge 2]
I've known you now for one whole year
There's something I've not told you, dear
Turned a blind eye for too long
This letter proves that I've been wrong

[Bridge 3]
I've known you now for one whole year
There's something I've not told you, dear
Turned a blind eye for too long
This letter proves that I've been wrong

[Verse 4]
Dear Angie
I've beat about the bush
It's time I spoke my mind
Dear Angie
It's been a long time comin
Guess I've been unkind

[Outro]
Dear Angie
The writing's on the wall
Dear Angie
I love you, you're my all
Guess that's allEmbed Dear Angie - Remastered 2010 Magic Christian Music (Remastered 2010 / Deluxe Edition) Badfinger psych-rock
