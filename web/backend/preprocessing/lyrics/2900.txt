26 ContributorsDirty Work Lyrics[Verse 1]
Times are hard, you're afraid to pay the fee
So you find yourself somebody
Who can do the job for free
When you need a bit of lovin'
'Cause your man is out of town
That's the time you get me runnin'
And you know I'll be around

[Chorus]
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Light the candle, put the lock upon the door
You have sent the maid home early
Like a thousand times before
Like the castle in its corner in a medieval game
I foresee terrible trouble
And I stay here just the same

[Chorus]
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more3Embed Dirty Work Can't Buy A Thrill Steely Dan psych-rock
