El amor es puro
El amor entiende lo que nadie puede entender

[Chorus:]
You never see it coming
Then the next thing you know...
Unconditional love...
Unconditional love
She ain't looking for no diamonds
Ain't digging for no gold
Just somebody to love...
Unconditional love
Woaaah

[Verse 1:]
1st of January
Said you starting over
Your heart's been in remission
Making a new beginning (yeah)
And it's been six months since you got sober
Taking a new position
To make a better decision
Then you head to the corner store
And forget what you went for
Just as soon as he says hello... hello
You might also like[Chorus:]
You never see it coming
Then the next thing you know...
Unconditional love...
Unconditional love
She ain't looking for no diamonds
Ain't digging for no gold
Just somebody to love...
Unconditional love
Woaaah


[Spoken Bridge]
No necesito nada ni a nadie si te tengo aquí
Te amo para siempre, te amo eternalmente
Tú me ensenaste como amar y por eso te agradezco
Te amo papi, te amo mi amor

[Chorus:]
You never see it coming
Then the next thing you know...
Unconditional love...
Unconditional love
She ain't looking for no diamonds
Ain't digging for no gold
Just somebody to love...
Unconditional love
Woaaah

[Verse 2:]
The fourteenth of February
Got a cold shoulder
From someone so unexpected
You left your heart unprotected (yeah)
Then you built the China Wall
Guard it like a soldier
People would call your phone
You act like nobody's home

[Phyllisia:]
And I went to the corner store
And I forgot what I went for
Just as soon as you said hello...
Helllooo

[Chorus]
I never saw it coming
Then the next thing I know...
Unconditional love...
Unconditional love
I ain't looking for no diamonds
Ain't digging for no gold
Just somebody to love...
Unconditional love
Woaaah
You never see it coming
Then the next thing you know...
Unconditional love...
Unconditional love
I ain't looking for no diamonds
Ain't digging for no gold
Just somebody to love...
Unconditional love
Woaaah
