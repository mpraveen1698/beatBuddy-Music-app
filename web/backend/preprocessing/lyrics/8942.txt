2 ContributorsOld Downtown Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know they said never look back
But we keep driving to where it's at
Whatever way we go
We gotta dig our way out of the snow

[Chorus]
Give me a roll through your old downtown, oh
Not gonna fuss, wanna turn around, oh
Give me a roll through your old downtown babe
Give me a roll through your old downtown, oh
Not gonna fuss, wanna turn around, oh
Give me a roll through your old downtown babe

Oh babe

[Verse 2]
Gotta figure this out somehow
You made another move and now we're heading back south

[Chorus]
Give me a roll through your old downtown, oh
Not gonna fuss, gonna turn around, oh
Give me a roll through your old downtown babe
Give me a roll through your old downtown, oh
Not gonna fuss, wanna turn around, oh
Give me a roll through your old downtown babe
