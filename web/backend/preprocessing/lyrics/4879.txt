Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather

[Verse 1]
Rose-colored boy
I hear you makin' all that noise about the world you want to see
And, oh, I'm so annoyed
'Cause I just killed off what was left of the optimist in me

[Pre-Chorus]
And, ooh, hearts are breakin' and wars are ragin' on
And I have taken, uh, my glasses off
You got me nervous, I'm right at the end of my rope
A half-empty girl, don't make me laugh, I'll choke

[Chorus]
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

[Post-Chorus]
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather

And I want you to stop insisting that I'm not
A lost cause 'cause I been through a lot
And, really, all I've got is just to stay pissed off
If it's alright by you

[Pre-Chorus]
But hearts are breakin' and wars are ragin' on
And I have taken, uh, my glasses off
You got me nervous when you're turnin' it into a joke
A half-empty girl, don't make me laugh, I'll—

[Chorus]
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

[Bridge]
Hmm, ooh
Leave me here a little bit longer
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seein' me cry now
You say we gotta look on the bright side
I say, "Well, maybe if you wanna go blind"
You say my eyes are gettin' too dark now
But, boy, you ain't ever seen my mind
[Chorus]
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
I know we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

[Outro]
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather48Embed Rose-Colored Boy After Laughter Paramore emo
