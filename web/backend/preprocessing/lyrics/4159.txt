25 ContributorsHeat Above Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sorrows of the Earth
May our tears of rain wash down to bathe you
This is what life is worth
When the fires still burn and rage all around

[Refrain]
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Fire still burning on the ground

[Verse 2]
Follow the fearsome sound
As they march to battle, hear the drums pound
We do not fight for war
But to save the lives of those who do so

[Refrain]
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Fire still burning on the ground

[Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
Rising with the heat above
Life's the story of
Ascending to the stars as one

Marching across the land
Is a peaceful army joining the band
Walking hand in hand
To an anthem loudly sung where they stand

[Refrain]
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Fire still burning on the ground

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
Rising with the heat above
Life's the story of
Ascending to the stars as one
