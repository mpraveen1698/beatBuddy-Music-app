3 ContributorsPhysical (Remastered 2021) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm sayin’ all the things that I know you'll like
Makin' good conversation
I gotta handle you just right
You know what I mean?
I took you to an intimate restaurant
Then to a suggestive movie
There’s nothin' left to talk about
'Less it's horizontally

[Chorus]
Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk
Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk

[Verse 2]
I’ve been patient and I’ve been good
Tried to keep my hands on the tablе
It's gettin’ hard, this holdin' back
You know what I mean?
I'm sure you'll undеrstand my point of view
We know each other mentally
You gotta know that you’re bringin' out
The animal in me
You might also like[Chorus]
Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk
Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk, ah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk
Let's get animal, animal
I wanna get animal, let's get into animal
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk, ah-ah

[Outro]
Let me hear your body talk (Your body talk)
