Push your care, push your burdens aside
Erase everything inside and leave
Just one thing on your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
You only live once, so just go fucking nuts!
Muah... go!

[Chorus]
Live life hard
Live life hard

[Post-Chorus]
You only get one shot, so shoot!

[Verse 2]
With every breath you take, you're dying
With every step we take, we're falling apart
If we only had one chance, we'd breathe
So let's take the chance right now and scream
[Pre-Chorus]
You only live one life, for a very short time
So make every second divine
You might also like[Chorus]
Go! Live life hard
Live life hard

[Verse 3]
Are you still breathing?
It's your heart that's beating inside that keeps us alive
And for the very first time, we're pushing aside
To surrender everything that I see in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Except for the one thing on my mind
That I am alive! For the very first time!

[Refrain]
For the first time, pushing worry aside
For the first time, pushing worry aside

[Bridge]
Erase everything inside
Erase everything inside
Erase everything inside
And leave just one thing!
You only get one shot!

[Pre-Chorus]
You only live once, so just go fucking nuts!
You only live once, so just go fucking nuts!
You only live once, go fucking nuts!
You only live once, so just go fucking nuts!
[Outro]
