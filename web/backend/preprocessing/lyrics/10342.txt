9 ContributorsLife’s a Bitch Lyrics[Intro]
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Working the streets till way after dark
Drives her beat up Chevy back to the trailer park
Runs the shower to wash off the men
Tomorrow night she'll do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
But later on at the bar and grill
She's drinking with her friends till she gets her fill
'Cause nothings gonna break her will

[Chorus]
Life's a bitch
I don't know why
There's no shelter, no alibi
Life's a bitch
No easy way
No lucky number, no holiday

[Verse 2]
Single dad, he works two jobs
He's cooking meals while he cleans the house
He's got no love life, the rent's overdue
The kids need braces, glasses and shoes

And even though his life is Hell
When he looks at the pictures up on the shelf
He just smiles to himself

[Chorus]
Life's a bitch
I don't know why
There's no shelter, no alibi
Life's a bitch
No easy way
No lucky number, no holiday

[Bridge]
(Hell yeah)
It's gonna be alright
(Hell yeah)
Just keep rocking on through the night
Life's a bitch

(Hell yeah)
It's gonna be alright
(Hell yeah)
Keep on rocking through the night

[Chorus]
I don't know why
There's no shelter, no alibi
Life's a bitch
So they say
No champagne and no Crème brûlée
Life's a bitch
[Outro]
Life's a bitch
And then you die
Then it's over, just say goodbyeEmbed Life's a Bitch Life's a Bitch Accept heavy-metal
