Darling, I'd wait for you
Even if you didn't ask me to
Tie a lasso 'round the Moon
And bring it on down to you
I'd bottle the feeling you give me
And shelve that stuff for years to come
'Cause, baby, when your arms are around me
I'd swear that I'm holding the Sun

[Chorus]
I'd give you the Sun if you asked me
You could have all of the time
You could have the stars and the trees
When dividing up the Universe
You could have mine
You could have mine

[Verse 2]
Darling, I'd wish that you
Could give me some more time
To herd thе whole sky in my arms
And releasе it when you're mine
I'd tell you, "I thought I loved you, too"
I just didn’t have the words to say
That I'd put the beach in your backyard
In hopes to be enough for you to stay
You might also like[Chorus]
I'd give you the Sun if you asked me
You could have all of the time
You could have the stars and the trees
When dividing up the Universe
You could have mine
You could have mine

[Bridge]
(I'd give you the Sun)
(I'd give you the Sun)

[Outro]
(I'd give you the Sun)
I'd give you the Sun if you asked me
You could have all of the time
(I'd give you the Sun)
You could have the stars and the trees
When dividing up the Universe
You could have mine
You could have mine
You could have mine4Embed j's lullaby (darlin' i'd wait for you) j's lullaby (darlin' i'd wait for you) Delaney Bailey indie-pop
