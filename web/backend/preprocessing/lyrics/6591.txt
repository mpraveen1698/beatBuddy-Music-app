86 ContributorsYou Will Be Found Lyrics[EVAN]
Have you ever felt like nobody was there?
Have you ever felt forgotten in the middle of nowhere?
Have you ever felt like you could disappear?
Like you could fall, and no one would hear?
(spoken)
But see, see the thing is when I looked up Connor was there
That was the gift he gave me, to show me that I wasn't alone
To show me that I mattered. Everybody does
That's the gift that he gave all of us. I just wish, I wish I could have given that to him...

(sung)
Well, let that lonely feeling wash away
Maybe there’s a reason to believe you’ll be okay
‘Cause when you don’t feel strong enough to stand
You can reach, reach out your hand

And oh, someone will come running
And I know, they’ll take you home

Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
And when you’re broken on the ground
You will be found
You might also likeSo let the sun come streaming in
'Cause you’ll reach up and you’ll rise again
Lift your head and look around
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found

[ALANA, spoken]
Have you seen this? Someone put a video of your speech online.​

[EVAN, spoken]
My speech?

[ALANA, spoken]
People started sharing it, I guess, and now, I mean—Connor is everywhere.​

[JARED, spoken]
Your speech is everywhere. This morning The Connor Project page, it only had 56 people following it.​

[EVAN, spoken]
Well, how many does it have now?

[JARED, spoken]
Four ​thousand, five hundred, eighty-two
[CYNTHIA, spoken]
Sixteen thousand, two hundred and thirty-nine

[EVAN, spoken]
I don't understand, what happened?

[CYNTHIA, spoken]
You did!

[ALANA]
There’s a place where we don’t have to feel unknown

[COMMUNITY VOICES, spoken]
Oh my god.​
Everybody needs to see this.​

[ALANA]
And every time that you call out
You’re a little less alone

[COMMUNITY VOICES, spoken]
I can't stop watching this video
Seventeen years old

[JARED]
If you only say the word
[COMMUNITY VOICES, spoken]
Take five minutes.​
This will make your day

[JARED & ALANA]
From across the silence
Your voice is heard

[COMPANY & COMMUNITY VOICES, spoken]

A beautiful tribute— Favorite
(Ah)
I know someone who really needed to hear this today
So thank you Evan Hansen, for doing what you're doing
(Ah ah)
I never met you Connor, but coming on here, reading everyone's posts...
(Someone will come running)
It's so easy to feel alone
(Ah ah)
But Evan is exactly right—we're not alone, none of us
We're not alone, none of us
None of us
None of us are alone
Like. Forward

Like. Share. Repost. Forward
Thank you Evan Hansen
For giving us a space to remember Connor

Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
When you’re broken on the ground
You will be found
So let the sun come streaming in
'Cause you’ll reach up and you’ll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found (You will be found)
You will be found (You will be found)
You will be found

Out of the shadows
The morning is breaking
And all is new, all is new
It's filling up the empty
And suddenly I see that
All is new, all is new
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone (You are not alone)
You are not alone (You are not alone)
You are not
You are not alone (You are not alone)
