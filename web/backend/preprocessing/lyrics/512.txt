Down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sung it in the wind, and sung to the thunder, rollin' over and over
We're down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sung it in the wind, and sung to the thunder, rollin' over and over
We're down

[Verse 1]
We're getting on fire
We're raisin' up higher
The bottle is up, we're over the top, it's time to get wild
The timе of our life
Is happenin' now
We'rе out of control, together we are rollin' over and over

[Chorus]
We're down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sung it in the wind, and sung to the thunder, rollin' over and over
We're down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sung it in the wind, and sung to the thunder, rollin' over and over
We're down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sung it in the wind, and sung to the thunder, rollin' over and over
We're down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sung it in the wind, and sung to the thunder

[Verse 2]
We gotta rock, rock, party 'til the last shot
Fill that jug, and raise your cup up
We gotta chug, chug, better take it non-stop
Hey! Come drink until the last drop
So please just let us, burnin' down this place
And we will end up in the hall of fame
Let's get ready for a drinking game
So come and sip until the last drop
Over and over

[Chorus]
We're down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sung it in the wind, and sung to the thunder, rollin' over and over
We're down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sung it in the wind, and sung to the thunder, rollin' over and over
We're down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sung it in the wind, and sung to the thunder, rollin' over and over
We're down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sung it in the wind, and sung to the thunder
