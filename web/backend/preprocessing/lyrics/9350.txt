Tired, oh I'm tired
I try to keep it out of my head
But I keep tripping on wires
Running, keep running
I‘ll never let them catch me
But damn that evil never stops coming

For what I am

[Chorus]
Hunted
They want to own me and take control
Hunted
I’ll keep fighting to save my soul

[Verse 2]
A villain, oh a villain
Taking every shot that I get
They make me feel like I'm stealing
Running, keep running
One step ahead of the world
And I will never stop trying

[Chorus]
Hunted
They want to own me and take control
Hunted
I'll keep fighting to save my soul

I am hunted
I am hunted

[Chorus]
I am hunted
They want to own mе and take control
Hunted
I’ll keep fighting to save my soulEmbed Hunted Hunted Egypt Central grunge
