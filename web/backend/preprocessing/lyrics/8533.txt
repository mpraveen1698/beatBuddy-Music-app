23 ContributorsCome Lyrics[Verse 1]
Black burn, I feel so alone
Without you boy
Now I'm here
Hanging out in the street
Thinking about reactions over actions
Walking on the sky of my dreams

[Chorus]
Come, come, my baby come
I will show you the world
Come, come, my baby come
I will cover your nightmares
Come, come, my baby come
I will love you forever
Come, come, my baby come
I will not let you go

[Verse 2]
My love, I just feel so lost
Without you boy
I am yours even if time has passed
Take me away
From this impetuous world
Leaving this jail of my mind

[Bridge]
My soul, my soul is in Africa, with you boy

[Chorus]

I will show you the world

I will cover your nightmares

I will love you forever

My soul, is in Africa with you boy
Looking at the stars
On this diamond sky
Giving you my smile
So you can keep it on your mind
Floating on your blazing eyes

Come, come, my baby come
I will show you the world
Come, come, my baby come
I will cover your nightmares
Come, come, my baby come
