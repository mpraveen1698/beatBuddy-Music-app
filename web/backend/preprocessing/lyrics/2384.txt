18 ContributorsShouldnâ€™t Be Lyrics[Intro]
I can't stop feeling like none of this matters at

[Verse 1]
Fool around, tell me words
That you don't mean
I'm already numb to it
I'm already numb to it
Feed me lies, tear me up, break me down
I don't wanna be playin' these games

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm already used to them
I'm already used to you being this cold

[Chorus]
But keepin' you close shouldn't be hard
If you were honest when you said you missed me
You've played with my pride
Making me feel like we had something real

[Verse 2]
I know we've been over this, it's nothin' new
You're still gonna be leaving me here
It's easier hatin' you than missing you
But I don't wanna be feelin' this way
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm already through with it
I'm already tired of thinking at all

[Chorus]
'Cause keepin' you close shouldn't be hard
If you were honest when you said you missed me
You've played with my pride
Making me feel like we had something real
And making you stay shouldn't feel wrong
This is the last time I'll ask you to listen
I've played all my cards
Would you feel a thing if you saw me right now?

[Bridge]
No matter what I say to you, you're gone
I've been tryin' in vain to hold on
No matter what I say

[Chorus]
Keepin' you close shouldn't be hard
If you were honest when you said you've missed me
You've played with my pride
Making me feel like we had something real
And making you stay shouldn't feel wrong
This is the last time I'll ask you to listen
I've played all my cards
Would you feel a thing if you saw me right now?3Embed Shouldn't Be Shouldn't Be Luke Chiang chill
