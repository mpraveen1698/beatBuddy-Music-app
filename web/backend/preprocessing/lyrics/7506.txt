2 ContributorsNeed You LyricsI don’t wanna go, but I feel this way
Cause there’s something that we need to change
But we’ve been here like a thousand times
And, I still need you, need you in my life

Oooh, Ooh

Over the water
Right by the sunset
I see you, see you, see you
I need you, need you, need you

Over the border
Right now i’m helpless
I need you, need you, need you
I hope you need me too, Ooh

Oooh, Ooh

I don’t wanna show all my feelings, right
Cos there’s some things that I need to hide
But we’ve been here like a million times
And, I still need you, need you in my life

Over the water
Right by the sunset
I see you, see you, see you
I need you, need you, need you

Right now i’m helpless
I need you, need you, need you
I hopе you need me too, Ooh

Oooh, Ooh

I don’t wanna show all my feelings, right
Cos there’s some things that I need to hide
But we’ve been here like a million times
And, I still need you, need you in my lifeEmbed Need You Need You Horizon Blue;S3da;Coulson french
