Look into my face, then look again
We are not the same, we're different
To tell your tales and fables
You couldn't wait
You need a new clean slate without the dents
A place to put your pain, your consequence
When you look into the mirror
Are you even there?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know all your secrets 'cause I'll tell
It's hard enough being alone with myself
I don't know how long I'll be holding on
I know you tried your hardest, I know that you meant it well
But you pushed me to the edge and I slipped and then I fell
I don't know how long I'll be holding on

[Verse 2]
So write a brand-new page, then write again
I know your act is staged, yet you pretend
All while you're turnin' tables
With missing legs
I think you've overstayed your welcome in
So go the fuck away, don't come again
I'll see your face in the fire
And burn it out

I don't wanna know all your secrets 'cause I'll tell
It's hard enough being alone with myself
I don't know how long I'll be holding on
I know you tried your hardest, I know that you meant it well
But you pushed me to the edge and I slipped and then I fell
I don't know how long I'll be holding on

[Bridge]
Like a villain, I couldn't be
I didn't need it, it needed me
Like a villain, I couldn't be
I didn't need it, it needed me

[Breakdown]
I didn't need it, it needed me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know all your secrets 'cause I'll tell
It's hard enough being alone with myself
I don't know how long I'll be holding on
I know you tried your hardest, I know that you meant it well
But you pushed me to the edge and I slipped and then I fell
I don't know how long I'll be holding on
