46 ContributorsLust for Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs and the flesh machine
He's gonna do another striptease
Hey man, where'd you get that lotion?
I been hurting since I bought the gimmick
About something called love
Yeah, something called love
Well, that's like hypnotizing chickens

[Chorus]
Well, I'm just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cause I've a  lust for life
'Cause I've a lust for life

[Verse 2]
I'm worth a million in prizes
With my torture film, drive a GTO
Wear a uniform all on a government loan
I'm worth a million in prizes
Yeah, I'm through with sleeping on the sidewalk
No more beating my brains
No more beating my brains
With the liquor and drugs
With the liquor and drugs
See Iggy Pop LiveGet tickets as low as $280You might also like[Chorus]
Well, I am just a modern guy
Of course, I've had it in the ear before
'Cause I've a lust for life (lust for life)
'Cause I've a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Got a lust for life
Oh a lust for life
Oh a lust for life
A lust for life
I got a lust for life
I got a lust for life

Well, I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
Well I've a lust for life
'Cause I've a lust for life

[Verse 3]
Well, here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs, and the flesh machine
I know he's gonna do another striptease
Hey man, where'd you get that lotion?
Your skin starts itching once you buy the gimmick
About something called love
Oh, love, love, love
Well, that's like hypnotizing chickens
[Chorus]
Well, I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
And I've a lust for life
(Lust for life)
'Cause I've a lust for life
(Lust for life)
Got a lust for life
Yeah a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Oh a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Yeah a lust for life
I got a lust for life
A lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life
A lust for life
