2 ContributorsShortcut to Heaven Lyrics[Intro]
Alright, what if it is?

[Verse 1]
Been a long day, been a long year
Runnin' in circles
Jumpin' the hurdles
Til' you walked in my life
Everything changed and I swear
I couldn't have planned it
You were the answer
I never thought I would find (Oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
They say love can come so soon (So soon, yeah)
You're my living proof

[Chorus]
Oh my God, what a blessing
Out of ten, you're eleven
I waited so long, I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven
Never the same since I knew ya
One touch and I say Hallеlujah
I waited so long, I'll never movе on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Your love is a shortcut to heaven

[Verse 2]
I think I struck gold and I found home
All at the same time
My high and my baseline
You’re my holiest ground (Mm-mm, yeah)
So good it hurts
You make it worth
All of the waiting
Somebody patient
Somebody kind

[Pre-Chorus]
They say love can come so soon
You're my living proof

[Chorus]
Oh my God, what a blessing
Out of ten, you're eleven
I waited so long, I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven
Never the same since I knew ya
One touch and I say Hallelujah
I waited so long, I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven
[Post-Chorus]
Your love is a shortcut to heaven

[Bridge]
They say love can come so soon
Thank God that I found you

[Chorus]
Oh my God, what a blessing (Oh my God)
Out of ten, you're eleven
I waited so long, I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven (Your love is a shortcut to heaven)
Never the same since I knew ya
One touch and I say Hallelujah
I waited so long, I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut to heaven

[Outro]

Now that I found ya
Your love is a shortcut to heaven
Now that I found ya
Now that I found ya
Now that I found ya
