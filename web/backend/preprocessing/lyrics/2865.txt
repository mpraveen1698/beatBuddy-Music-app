18 ContributorsLED Lyrics[Verse 1]
In 2016, everything changed when I fuckin' Dropped Dead (Dropped Dead)
In 2017, 25 city tour back to back, ain't stoppin' (Nah)
2018 to infinity, droppin' like a bomb, I'm atomic (Atomic)
Bitch, it's OmenXIII, I'ma keep it 01000111, bitch

[Chorus]
I don't really fuck with nobody
Now they all mad they can't stop me, give a fuck if you got me
Bitch, I still know they all watchin'
Bitch, we all know they still watchin', we can see it in the comments
I don't really fuck with you, shawty
Now I know she mad she can't cop me, give a fuck, bitch, I got it
Everybody know that I got it
Everybody know that I'm solid, you can see it in my wallet
Runnin' through bands on the daily
Runnin' through racks bi-weekly, we be
Gunnin' through plans like we crazy
Why the fuck is yo mans tryna see me? They be
Plottin' on me and that's shady
Last year the same dude hate me, but see
Got it on me, bands lately
Everybody wanna be famous, not me

[Verse 2]
OmenXIII, black shirt, black jeans
Black nails, everything all black on me
Floatin' out the room like a mothafuckin' ghost
With my new jean chains and my XL Tee
Everybody know me when they see me nowadays
I'm amazed, I just say now that's how life be
Fuck the ones that hated, we ain't never gonna stop
We keep headed to the top, and that's on me
You might also like[Chorus]
Fuck the ones that say you can't make it
Everybody know they just hatin' (Hatin')
Fuck these internet fake killas
Everybody know which ones fakin' (Fakin')
Fuck a nine-to-five, bitch, I did it
Everybody know I ain't kiddin' (Ain't kiddin')
And fuck all the rules, I'm a misfit
Everybody know I ain't listening, real shit
Fuck the ones that say you can't make it
Everybody know they just hatin' (Hatin')
Fuck these internet fake killas
Everybody know which ones fakin' (Fakin')
Fuck a nine-to-five, bitch, I did it
Everybody know I ain't kiddin' (Ain't kiddin')
And fuck all the rules, I'm a misfit
Everybody know I ain't  listening, real shit2Embed LED Corrupted OmenXIII emo
