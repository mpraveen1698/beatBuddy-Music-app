Oh hey, I wasn't listening
I was watching Syria
Blinded by the sunshine strip
And you, you were in the kitchen
Oh your mariner's mouth
The wounded with the wounder's whip

[Bridge]
And that's how summer passed:
The great dividing range, the green, green grass
And oh, maybe it was peace at last
Who knew

[Chorus]
Then, hello love
My invincible friend
Oh, hello love
The thistle and the burr
Oh, hello love
For you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were, no

[Verse 2]
Oh hey, I wasn't listening
I was stung by all of us
The blind leading out the bored
And as per usual
You were skipping and laughing
Eyes at the bedroom door
"Don't take it so seriously, no
Only time is ours, the rest we'll just wait and see!"
Maybe you're right, babe
Maybe

Then, hello love
My invincible friend
Oh, hello love
The thistle and the burr
Oh, hello love
For you I have so many words

I, I forget where we were, no
I forget where we were
I forget where we were
