I don't wanna smoke, I don't need a drink
Just tell me how you feel, tell me what you think
'Cause I've been on my own for a fuckin' while
And I don't need a girl, I just wanna smile
Gettin' my mind right
I'll wait 'til the time's right
I'm meanin' to tell you
Why it's hard to sleep at night
There's nothin' to fear now
Girl, we should be here now
So why don't you hear me out?
I'm sayin'

[Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
Talk is overrated, let's just vibe
And love is overrated in my mind
Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe
Just for tonight

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be yours if you want me to
I'll be yours if you want me to

[Verse 2: Jeremy Zucker]
I've been hella stressed, I would rather chill
I know you looked at me, wonder how I deal
But look inside my soul, I don't mean to front
'Cause really I don't know what the fuck I want
I remember when we were more than friends
I would just pretend, that was cold
After all this shit, I could not let you in
Summer went, saved up all the money
That I would've spent
On you, girl
You might also like[Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
Talk is overrated, let's just vibe
And love is overrated in my mind
Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe
Just for tonight

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be yours if you want me to
I'll be yours if you want me to

[Verse 3: blackbear]
Yeah, let's talk it out
Girl, time out
I know that you're only with me for the clout, sit down
You had too much to drink
Maybe it's my fault
I remember you would pull up, pour up Hennessy askin' to smoke
No, no, there you go again
Mixin' blow with downers
Brand new hoes around ya
And when the night is done, you'll be hittin' my line
Tell me your phone at one per cent
3:00 A.M., you wanna vibe

[Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
Talk is overrated, let's just vibe
And love is overrated in my mind
Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe
Just for tonight
[Post-Chorus]
I'll be yours if you want me to
I'll be yours if you want me to46Embed talk is overrated idle Jeremy Zucker;blackbear electro
