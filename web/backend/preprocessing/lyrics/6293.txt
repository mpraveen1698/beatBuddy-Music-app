15 ContributorsShot in the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's a hard run
Loving like we do
Takes way too long to get over you
And remember the line we drew
But call me over and I'm coming through

[Chorus]
We're searching for the night together
Where we don't fall apart
Might be now and it might be never
It's just another shot in the dark
It's just another shot in the dark

[Verse 2]
And I wonder what it all means
Strange conversation with you in my dreams
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I've loved seven other women and thеy all were you

[Chorus]
We had a run of bad romancеs
They always missed the mark
So close your eyes now and take your chances
It's just another shot in the dark
It's just another shot in the dark
You might also like[Bridge]
I want you in the worst way
Is the gate code still your birthday

[Chorus]
If you thought you met your Casanova
And he left you with a broken heart
Remember when it's done and over
It was only just a shot in the dark
It was only just a shot in the dark
It's just another shot in the dark
It's just another shot in the dark1Embed Shot in the Dark Sob Rock John Mayer songwriter
