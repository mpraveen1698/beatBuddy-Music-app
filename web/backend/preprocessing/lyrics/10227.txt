8 ContributorsSMILE Lyrics[Intro]
Duh-duh-duh
Yeah, yeah
Duh-duh-duh-duh
Duh-duh-duh (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I find it so unfair
Why can't I be happy everywhere?
Oh, I saw the signs, they said, "Beware"
But I just pass on by 'cause I'm not scared

[Chorus]
I swear I been walking for miles
If it was real life, I'd be freezing
I said if I'ma give up, I'ma do it in style
But so far, I haven't found a reason
And I've been looking, but nobody wanna help me
Don't deserve it, maybe I've been cold, but
I'll just keep on forcing a smile
And it's working, yeah, I think they're sold

[Verse 1]
They been working 24/7 tryna keep me down
I hate to say it, I ain't going away
I really hope when I'm in Heaven
I'm someone they wanna keep around
Gotta make sure I keep my head on straight
But if I don't leave my apartment
How the fuck will I get started?
I got plenty planes to catch
And I think they all just departed
Got ideas in my head
And, yeah, they might not be the smartest
But at least I put in work and try to get 'em done regardless
You might also like[Bridge]
It's been me against the world and somebody gotta win soon
I think it's absurd all the stuff that we done been through
And I been laying low and that's something I'm not into
I got a lot to show, they said, "Pull it from within you"

[Pre-Chorus]
I find it so unfair
Why can't I be happy everywhere?

[Chorus]
I swear I been walking for miles
If it was real life, I'd be freezing
I said if I'ma give up, I'ma do it in style
But so far, I haven't found a reason
And I've been looking, but nobody wanna help me
Don't deserve it, maybe I've been cold, but
I'll just keep on forcing a smile
And it's working, yeah, I think they're sold

[Outro]
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
