11 ContributorsSalt Lyrics[Verse 1: Jeremy DePoyster]
I can never process
What I'm feeling in my bones
Like a sickness
That I can't diagnose

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
Some days I think I'm afraid of my shadow
I show up to fight at all the wrong battles
And I don't think my mind will be right 'til I

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
Pour the salt into the wound
Let the rain wash over you
If everything I said was true
Then why am I paralyzed?

[Verse 2: Jeremy DePoyster, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
Watch the grass blow in the wind for the hell of it
And sometimes I get so caught up that I forget
(How could I forget?)

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
That all of our words only mean what's behind them
You can't throw gasoline on a fire
And say you tried to put it out
You might also like[Chorus: Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
Pour the salt into the wound
Let the rain wash over you
If everything I said was true
Then why am I
Hiding from the blinding lights?
I never had an alibi
If everything I said was true
Then why am I, why am I still paralyzed?

[Bridge: Jeremy DePoyster]
(Why am I still paralyzed?)
Step back as the ashes rise
Embers up toward the sky
With all the things that I can't find

[Chorus: Jeremy DePoyster, Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
Pour the salt into the wound
Let the rain wash over you
If everything I said was true
Then why am I
Hiding from the blinding lights?
I never had an alibi
If everything I said was true
Then why am I, why am I still paralyzed?
[Outro: Jeremy DePoyster]
