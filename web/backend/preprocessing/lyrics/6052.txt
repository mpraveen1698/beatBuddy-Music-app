You're a mess, tangled with your confidence
You think you haven't sinned
Well, you're unstoppable
Your walls are impassible, oh

[Verse 2]
Oh, I think you're better off looking alone
'Cause the boys that chase your hips can just go find their way home
And at the end of the day you think to yourself
"My body is a product being sold on a shelf"

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I can change, tell me I can change

[Chorus]
Well, I know you lay in bed
Contemplating your own death
Well, just look at what you've done
Don't you dare forget the sun, love

[Post-Chorus]
Don't forget!

[Verse 3]
Cold, white walls keep you from your pad and pen
You just wanna stab again
I can't believe it's half this hard
You never knew your mind was dark, no
You might also like[Verse 4]
I think you're better off looking alone
'Cause the boys that chase your hips can just go find their way home
You can dig so deep for scars
You never knew your mind was dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on and breathe with me, oh
Breathe with me, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Well, I know you lay in bed
Contemplating your own death
Well, just look at what you've done
Don't you dare forget the sun, love

You look down on, me so casually
In everything I know
You look down on me, but not right at me
Did I wreck this broken home?

[Bridge]
Dear diary
Life is trying me
Can I get a sign?
Or a two of mind, a piece of mind?
Can I get a sign? (A sign)
Can I get a sign? (I know)
[Chorus]
Well, I know you lay in bed (in bed)
Contemplating your own death
Well, just look at what you've done
Don't you dare forget the sun, love!

You look down on me, so casually
In everything I know
You look down on me, but not right at me
Is it plain to see that life is trying me?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, life is trying me!
Life is trying

[Outro]
Can I think of something?
Gotta think of something!21Embed Don't You Dare Forget the Sun Built for Blame, Laced With Shame - Spotify Exclusive Get Scared metalcore
