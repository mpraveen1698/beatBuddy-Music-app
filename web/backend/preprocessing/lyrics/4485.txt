Don't talk, not yet
I know what you're about to say
Don't avoid my eyes
Please, don't do that

[Verse 1: eAeon]
Our home is here, it's us
We've been through worse
This can't be the end of us
So many things left undone

[Chorus: eAeon]
Don't leave
So much would collapse
Don't destroy us
It'll break you too
Don't, don't leave
Don't throw away everything
Please, don't

[Verse 2: RM]
What color are waves
White as snow when they break
Did you survive the drift ok
Still as a pebble, could you stay
Turn on the moon
In my small chimney, could you stay
Don’t take that name away, the one only you know
I don't need magic
I hate being just any wildflower
Don't be new
Just be here
Stay here, don't go
You might also like[Chorus: eAeon]
Don't leave
There's no place like home
Don't destroy us
Don't break a heart into two
Don't, don't leave
Don't abandon everything
Please, don't

[Bridge: eAeon]
Don't you still love
I know it's not over yet
Don't say things you don't mean
I know you want me to hold you too
Stay here, don't go

[Chorus: Both]
Don't leave
There's no place like home
Don't destroy us
Don't break a heart into two
Don't, don't leave
Don't abandon everything
Please, don't

[Outro: Both]
Don't leave
So much would collapse
Don't destroy us
It'll break you too
Don't, don't leave
Don't abandon everything
Please, don't7Embed Don't (feat. RM) Fragile eAeon;RM electro
