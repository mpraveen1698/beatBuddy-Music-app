4 ContributorsTalk It Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ooh, oh, ooh
When the lights go out (Go out, go out)
And you're blacking out
You wanna walk on me like I'm nobody
You wanna talk to me
You wanna talk it out
I'm tired out just like I've always been since we met for the first time (You were mine)
And I've been high on my luck waiting for the next good thing to come by (Nevermind)

[Refrain]
Then you walked me out (Go out, go out)
And you wandered out on your own way
You stayed there 'till this day
And if you come back now
There's no backing out
So I'll do the best I can
I hope you understand
We can talk it out

[Verse 2]
I'm tired out just like I've always been since we met for the first time (You were mine)
And if you change your mind and leave me to myself once more, I won't cry (It's fine)
I know you thought I'd stay tongue-tied
Hide my pain and swallow my pride ('Cause it never works out your way, 'cause the best was never enough then)
I knew you had your doubts and never thought I'd want to say goodbye (It's time)
You might also like[Refrain]
Then you walked me out (Go out, go out)
And you wandered out on your own way
You stayed there 'till this day
And if you come back now
There's no backing out
So I'll do the best I can
I hope you understand
We can talk it out1Embed Talk It Out Talk It Out dwsdmusic sad
