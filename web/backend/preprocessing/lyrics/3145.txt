I go through your iPad looking for
Something that I used to have
Guess I finally lost my mind (Lost my mind)
I wish that I could take my number back
Go back to the place we met
Start this up a second time (A second time)
You're living in a past life, twenty-five
All your friends are verified
Acting like they're first in line
I'm looking at your life through cellophane
Hoping things would stay the same
I was always by your side

[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it strange
How we're strangers again?
Isn't it strange
How we're strangers again?

[Chorus]
And now we're strangеrs again
And now we're strangers again

[Post-Chorus]
You wеre just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like seventeen
Hurt me 'til I feel alive

I wonder who your friends are
Where you go, who you know now?
You play the same card
Swear to God, do you call him?

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't it strange
How we're strangers again?

[Chorus]
And now we're strangers again
And now we're strangers again
(Now we're strangers, now we're strangers)
(Now we're strangers, now we're strangers)

[Post-Chorus]
You were just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like seventeen
Hurt me 'til I feel alive

[Verse 3]
Isn't it strange how we're strangers again?
Now both of us know we were better as friends
When it all, yeah, when it all falls apart
Sometimes you let go, just to know where to start
[Bridge]
(I go through your iPad looking for, and now we're)
Something that I used to have
(I go through your iPad looking for, and now we're)
Something that I used to have
(I go through your iPad looking for, and now we're)
Something that I used to have
(I go through your iPad looking for)

[Chorus]
And now we're strangers again
Something that I used to have
(Oh-woah)

[Post-Chorus]
You were just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like seventeen
