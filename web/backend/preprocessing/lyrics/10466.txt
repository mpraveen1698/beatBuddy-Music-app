You put all your faith in my dreams
You gave me the world that I wanted
What did I do to deserve you?
I follow your steps with my feet
I walk on the road that you started
I need you to know that I heard you, every word

[Pre-Chorus]
I've waited way too long to say
Everything you mean to me

[Chorus]
In case you don’t live forever, let me tell you now
I love you more than you'll ever wrap your head around
In case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth
I’m everything that I am because of you

[Verse 2]
I, I've carried this song in my mind
Listen, it's echoing in me
But I haven't helped you to hear it
We, we've only got so much time
I'm pretty sure it would kill me
If you didn't know the pieces of me are pieces of you

[Chorus]
In case you don’t live forever, let me tell you now
I love you more than you’ll ever wrap your head around
In case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth

[Bridge]
I have a hero whenever I need one
I just look up to you and I see one
I'm a man 'cause you taught me to be one

[Chorus]
In case you don't live forever, let me tell you now
I love you more than you’ll ever wrap your head around
In case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth
I'm everything that I am

In case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth
