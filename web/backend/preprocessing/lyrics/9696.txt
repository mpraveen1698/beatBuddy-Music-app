12 ContributorsMay 1st Lyrics[Verse 1]
The world is half asleep
And you’re just hanging on
To the friends that you keep

[Verse 2]
Out here on the road
Watch the land unfolding under my
Shadow

[Chorus]
Sun goes down
Time rolls on
(Ha, ha, ha, haa)

[Verse 3]
You went out with the wind
Dreary as you can be
You know you’re right in the end

[Verse 4]
Wherever you’ve been
I know that you can make it on your own
My friend

[Chorus]
Sun goes down
Time rolls on
