7 ContributorsCage The Beast Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see it in your eyes
You're feeling paranoid
You know just what I've done
You know what I've become
I feel it deep inside
With all the pain and lies
I know just what I want
I am an animal

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's time I let you know
I could just end it all

[Chorus]
You can't cage the beast
There's no breaking me
You can't cage the beast inside of me
I feel the rage
And all the the pain
You can't cage the beast inside of me
Inside of me

[Verse 2]
I feel it in your vibe
You are a parasite
Who knows just what I've done
I think your time has come
You try to turn the tide
I think you've lost your mind
Afraid of what I want
This is what I've become

[Chorus]
You can't cage the beast
There's no breaking me
You can't cage the beast inside of me
I feel the rage
And all the the pain
You can't cage the beast inside of me
Inside of me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
You can't cage the beast
There's no breaking me
You can't cage the beast inside of me
I feel the rage
And all the the pain
You can't cage the beast inside of me
