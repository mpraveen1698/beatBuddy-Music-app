I heard glass shatter on the wall
In the apartment above mine
At first, I thought that I was dreamin'
But then I heard the voice of a girl
And it sounded like she’d been cryin'
Now I'm too worried to be sleepin’

[Pre-Chorus]
So I took the elevator to the second floor
Walked down the hall and then I knocked upon her door
She opened up, and I asked about the things I've been hearing

[Chorus]
She said, "I think your ears are playing tricks on you"
Sweater zipped up to her chin
"Thanks for caring, sir, that's nice of you
But I have to go back in
Wish I could tell you about the noise
But I didn't hear a thing"
She said, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"
She said, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"

[Verse 2]
So I was layin' on the floor of my room
Cold concrete on my back
No, I just couldn't shake the feeling
I didn't want to intrude 'cause I knew
That I didn’t have all the facts
But I couldn’t bear the thought of leavin' her

Wish I could tell you about the noise
But I didn't hear a thing"
She said, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"
She said, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"

[Bridge]
Aim my boombox at the roof, I'm playing "Lean On Me"
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me
And when she hears the words, I hope she knows she’ll be okay
Aim my boombox at the roof, I'm playing "Lean On Me"
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me
And when she hears the words, I know exactly what I'll say
[Chorus]
"Promise I'm not playing tricks on you
You're always welcome to come in
You could stay here for an hour or two
If you ever need a friend"
"We can talk about the noise when you're ready, but 'til then"
I'll say, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"
I'll say, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"21Embed Must Have Been The Wind These Two Windows Alec Benjamin electro
