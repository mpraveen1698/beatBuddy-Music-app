28 ContributorsTake a Picture Lyrics[Verse 1]
Awake on my airplane, awake on my airplane
My skin is bare, my skin is theirs
Awake on my airplane, awake on my airplane
My skin is bare, my skin is theirs

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like a newborn
And I feel like a newborn
Awake on my airplane, awake on my airplane
I feel so real

[Chorus]
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember, yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in, I don't believe in
Your sanctity, your privacy
I don't believe in, I don't believe in
Sanctity, a hypocrisy
Could everyone agree that
No one should be left alone?
Could everyone agree that
They should not be left alone? Yeah

Could you take my picture?
