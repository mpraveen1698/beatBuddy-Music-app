Bless this house, bless my pillow
Bless your pillow

Desire, where you want to be?
Lovingly
You'll have to send a strong goddamn wind
To get rid of me, every single piece

Sandpaper and gum, leaning and propped
Our arch undone, our arch undone

Desire, where you want to be?
Lovingly
You'll have to send a strong goddamn wind
To get rid of me, every single piece

Desire, where you want to be? [2x]
You'll have to send a strong goddamn wind
To get rid of me, every single piece

Sandpaper and gum, leaning and propped
Our arch undone, our arch undone

Desire, where you want to be? [3x]
Desire
You might also likeDesire, where you want to be?
Lovingly
You'll have to send a strong goddamn wind
To get rid of me, every single piece

Desire, my long way
The wrong way
