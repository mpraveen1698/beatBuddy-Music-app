Don't you think about me enough?
I've been burning my heart out
I've got to face, need to tell you
I won't run because I'm reticent

[Chorus]
You will know you're reborn tonight
Must be ragged, but I stay by your side
Even if my body's bleached to the bones
I don't want to go through that ever again

[Outro]
So cry no more, oh my beloved
Go ahead, be proud and fight it out
You are the ONE, our rising star
You guide us far to home yet girtYou might also like4Embed Call of Silence TV Anime "Attack on Titan Season 2" (Original Soundtrack) Hiroyuki Sawano anime
