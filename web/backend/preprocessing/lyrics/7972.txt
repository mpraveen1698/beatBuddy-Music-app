Don't try, don't try, don't try, don't try, don't try, don't try...

[Verse 1]
Mystic creature, come to me
Tell me what you know
Whisper, scream, I'm listening
There's nowhere I will go

[Refrain]
Hm-hm-hmm, hm-hm-hmm, hmm
(Don't try, don't try)

[Verse 2]
Look out to the horizon, to infinity
There is nothing to be done
So, do not try to speak

[Refrain]
Hm-hm-hmm, hm-hm-hmm, hmm
(Don't try, don't try)
Hm-hm-hmm, hmmm, hmm, hmm

[Break]

[Verse 3]
Honesty can only be if there is a lie
Tell me what you believe, don't try to hide
You might also like[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
(Don't try, don't try)
Oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh, ooh-oh

[Bridge]
Are you ready
To let me in?
Feeling it growing
Under your skin
Tattooed like ink in flesh
I don't mind the pain it's in
I've been trying to believe
What I said is what I need

[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
(Don't try, don't try)
Oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh, ooh-oh

[Outro]
(Don't try, don't try)
