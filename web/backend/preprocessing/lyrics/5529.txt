Yeah
Come on, man
Yeah
Listen

[Chorus]
Look, I'm a London scammer (Yeah)
I see it, I want it, I click it
Nights in the bando, Pyrex whippin' (Whip)
Next day, man started clickin' (Hmm)
Nobu, I’m waitress tippin' (Tip)
Bad B come and take this dicki n (Dick)
Codeine, that’s what I’m sippin' (Sip)
Money, that’s what I’m missin'
Look, I'm a London scammer (Yeah)
I see it, I want it, I click it
Nights in the bando, Pyrex whippin' (Whip)
Next day, man started clickin'
Nobu, I’m waitress tippin'
Bad B come and take this dick in
Codeine, that’s what I’m sippin'
Money, that’s what I’m missin'

[Verse 1]
Swing me your Monzo or your dozens
Either way, we’re makin' thousands (A minute)
I make so much money, I might have to get an accountant
Mainstreams fuck up the holders credit
I said, "Do you really wanna take that risk?" (Take that risk)
Look, I make more money than trappers and shit
I bought a fulls off the dark web
But I got bumped, that shit was dead (Dead)
Didn’t wanna take that L so I took out credit instead
Click eighty packages from Next, of course the address got blacklisted (No more)
So I sent it to my girl's instead

[Verse 2]
Look, I was chasin' the bag (Chasin')
More time, now I’m chasin' the suitcase
Best respect my clickin' like Blueface
Court case, got that shit on the 7th
BR gang really on drills like 7th
I’m fully gassed up, no 7/11
Look, niggas mad that I'm makin' more than their parents
In my Jordan 1s, I'm takin' your missus
Run outta luck 'cause she likin' my pictures
These opp boys just chat like bitches
These opp boys just move like girls (Yeah)
It was me and K1, we was up in the T with scales
It was me and K1 in that T with scales
