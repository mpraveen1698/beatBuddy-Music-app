24 ContributorsI Stand Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've told you this once before:
Can't control me
If you try to take me down
You're gonna break
I feel your every nothing
That you're doin' for me
I'm thinking you oughta
Make your own way

[Chorus]
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
Stand alone, stand alone...

[Verse 2]
You're always hiding behind
Your so-called goddess
So, what? You don't think
That we can see your face?
Resurrected back before
The final falling
I'll never rest until
I can make my own way

I'm not afraid of fading...

[Chorus]
I stand alone
Feeling your sting down inside me
I'm not dying for it
I stand alone
Everything that I believe is fading
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone

[Bridge]
And now it's my time (Now it's my time)
It's my time to dream (It's my time to dream)
Dream of the skies (Dream of the skies)
Make me believe that this place
Isn't plagued by the poison in me
And help me decide if my fire will burn out
Before you can breathe
Breathe into me

[Chorus]
I stand alone inside
I stand alone
I stand alone
Feeling your sting down inside me
I'm not dying for it
I stand alone
Everything that I believe is fading
I stand alone inside
I stand alone inside
I stand alone inside
I stand alone inside7Embed I Stand Alone Faceless Godsmack metal
