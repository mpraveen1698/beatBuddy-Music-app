8 ContributorsOne Night in Tokyo Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dangerous attraction
Femme fatale in action
The most beautiful mistake of my life
She's a neon flower
Pure seduction power

[Chorus]
One night in Tokyo
One night worth all my love

[Verse 2]
Willfully blindfolded
Mesmerized on this bed
When you touch me, I am where love is born
Feverish desire
Getting high on each other

[Chorus]
One night in Tokyo
One night worth all my love

[Post-Chorus]
My love

[Chorus]
One night in Tokyo
One night worth all my love
One night in Tokyo
One night worth all my love
