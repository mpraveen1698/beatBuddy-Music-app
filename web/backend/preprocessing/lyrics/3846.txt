53 ContributorsTalking Body Lyrics[Intro]
Hey
Hey

[Verse 1]
Bed, stay in bed
The feeling of your skin locked in my head
Smoke, smoke me broke
I don't care, I'm down for what you want

[Pre-Chorus]
Day drunk into the night, wanna keep you here
'Cause you dry my tears, yeah
Summer lovin' and fights, how it is for us
And it's all because

[Chorus]
Now if we're talking body (Hey)
You got a perfect one, so put it on me (Hey)
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right, we fuck for life
On and on and on
Now if we're talking body (Hey)
You got a perfect one, so put it on me (Hey)
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right, we fuck for life
On and on and on

Anything you want, I'll give it up
Lips, lips I kiss
Bite me while I taste your fingertips

[Pre-Chorus]
Day drunk into the night, wanna keep you here
'Cause you dry my tears, yeah
Summer lovin' and fights, how it is for us
And it's all because
