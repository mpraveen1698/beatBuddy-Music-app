3 Contributors​About You Lyrics[Intro]
Everyone keeps asking me
About you, about you
How do I explain to them
That we didn't make sense
I'm numb

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone keeps asking me
About you, about you
How do I explain to them
That we do not make sense? (Yeah)
'Cause everyone keeps asking me
About you, about you
How do I explain to them
That we didn't make sense?

[Verse 1]
Girl, I hate thinking about you
I always dream about you
I know I'm not the same
Fuck, I can't be me without you
It's fucked up, just fake love
You played me, you played us
You caved in, I gave up
You played games then straight front
You straight lied to my face
But it's alright, mess with my mind
So long as I stay, this girl is insane
I left but couldn't escape
I saw through your twisted ways
I ran fast, didn't look back
But tell the world I'm to blame, now
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause everyone keeps asking me
About you, about you
How do I explain to them
That we do not make sense? (Yeah)
'Cause everyone keeps asking me
About you, about you
How do I explain to them
That we didn't make sense?

[Verse 2]
I didn't want to let you go
Knew you'd come back again
Saw you losing control
Don't act like you don't know
When you manifested this
'Cause I said, "Don’t play games"
You're gonna see, let a stranger
In your house but he wasn't me
I finally figured out, I was deceived
Now I'm laying low
Trying not to grieve when

[Bridge]
Everyone keeps asking me
About you, about you
How do I explain to them
That we didn't make sense?
How do I explain?
[Chorus]
'Cause everyone keeps asking me
About you, about you
How do I explain to them
That we do not make sense?
Yeah, everyone keeps asking me (Everyone)
About you, about you
How do I explain to them
That we didn't make sense?

[Outro]
Everyone keeps asking me
About you, about you
How do I explain to them
That we didn't make sense?
