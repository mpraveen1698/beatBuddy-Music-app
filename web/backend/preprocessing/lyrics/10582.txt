'Bout time, I'm coming, we fall, rock bottom
Been the same

[Chorus]
Not enough, pour it up, move to the side
Runner-up, fuck around, never let me by
Promise that I will stay out of reach
Far gone, 'cause the shit still bothers me
Not enough, pour it up, move to the side
Runner-up, fuck around, never let me by
Promise that I will stay out of reach
Far gone, 'cause the shit still bothers me

[Verse 1]
If I had life, if I ain't budge
What a bad time, for this anxious
For this mudslide, for my father
And my poor taste, what'd it cost me?
Is she archived (You), that casa
How you drown outside water?
Go home now, sayonara
Go home now, sayonara (You)
You wasted, I'm faceless (You)
Yubaba (You), no patience
And we work it out at night, that's the grave shift
If we took another shot, would you chase it?
You might also like[Chorus]
Not enough, pour it up, move to the side
Runner-up, fuck around, never let me by
Promise that I will stay out of reach
Far gone, 'cause the shit still bothers me
Not enough, pour it up, move to the side
Runner-up, fuck around, never let me by
Promise that I will stay out of reach
Far gone, 'cause the shit still bothers me

[Refrain]
And the shit still bothers me, and the shit still bothers me

[Verse 2]
In December, runny nose, cold shoulder
Not enough, gonna need that dose up
(Dollar, dollar), need that dose up
Seen it all and I swear that show sucks
Gimme call if you need that torture
Dollar, dollar, rewind
Dollar, dollar, rewind
Dollar, dollar, rewind
Dollar, dollar, rewind
Dollar, dollar, rewind

[Chorus]
Not enough, pour it up, move to the side
Runner-up, fuck around, never let me by
Promise that I will stay out of reach
Far gone, 'cause the shit still bothers me
Not enough, pour it up, move to the side
Runner-up, fuck around, never let me by
Promise that I will stay out of reach
Far gone, 'cause the shit still bothers me33Embed SAYONARA WELCOME HOME Aries sad
