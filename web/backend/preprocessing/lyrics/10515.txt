"I'll be back, I'll be back"
That's what you said when you left me
I wish I could stay, I wish I could stay
But I need some space and you're in the way

[Chorus]
Can you see me? I'm dancing on my own
Can you hear me? I'm crying out for help
Is it ignorance or selfishness?
You said stay here but I'm running out of air
I hope you know, as I wait I suffocate

[Verse 2]
I hope you know, I hope you know
The air gets cold when you don't hold me
The sky turns grey, the sky turns grey
The flowers fade and blow away

[Chorus]
Can you see me? I'm dancing on my own
Can you hear me? I'm crying out for help
Is it ignorance or selfishness?
You said stay here but I'm running out of air
I hope you know, as I wait I suffocate
You might also like[Bridge]
Should I chase you down or should I keep waiting?
Should I move on or should I keep waiting?

[Chorus]
(Should I chase you down) Can you see me?
(Or should I keep waiting?) I'm dancing on my own
(Should I move on) Can you hear me?
(Or should I keep waiting?) I'm crying out for help
(Should I chase you down) Is it ignorance or selfishness?
(Or should I keep waiting?) You said stay here but I'm running out of air
(Should I move on?) I hope you know, as I wait I suffocate1Embed Suffocate Suffocate Hayd songwriter
