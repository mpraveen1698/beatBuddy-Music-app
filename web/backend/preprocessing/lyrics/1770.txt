Color me your color, baby
Color me your car
Color me your color, darling
I know who you are
Come up off your color chart
I know where you are coming from

You can call me any day or night

Cover me with kisses, baby
Cover me with love
Roll me in designer sheets
I'll never get enough
Emotions come, I don't know why
Cover up love's alibi
