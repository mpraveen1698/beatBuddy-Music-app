When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Bridge]
I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh

[Chorus]
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Outro]
And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing51Embed The Only Exception Brand New Eyes Paramore emo
