Have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir
Three bags full
One for my master
And one for my dame
And one for the little boy
Who lives down the lane
Baa, baa, black sheep
Have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir
Three bags full

Baa, baa, white sheep
Have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir
Three bags full
One for my master
And one for my dame
And one for the little girl
Who lives down the lane
Baa, baa, white sheep
Have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir
