22 ContributorsMaria Lyrics[Verse 1]
She moves like she don't care
Smooth as silk, cool as air
Ooh, it makes you wanna cry
She doesn't know your name
And your heart beats like a subway train
Ooh, it makes you wanna die

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, don't you wanna take her?
You wanna make her all your own?

[Chorus]
Maria
You've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina
Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights

[Verse 2]
I've seen this thing before
In my best friend and the boy next door
Fool for love and fool on fire

Won't come in from the rain
She's oceans running down the drain
Blue as ice and desire

[Bridge]
She walks like she don't care
You want to take her everywhere
Ooh, it makes you wanna cry
She's like a millionaire
Walking on imported air
Ooh, it makes you wanna die
