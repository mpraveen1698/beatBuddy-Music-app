24 ContributorsDance with the Devil Lyrics[Intro]
Here I stand
Helpless and left for dead

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes
So many days go by
Easy to find what's wrong
Harder to find what's right

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe in you
I can show you that
I can see right through
All your empty lies
I won't stay long
In this world so wrong

[Chorus]
Say goodbye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the Devil tonight

[Verse 2]
Trembling
Crawling across my skin
Feeling your cold, dead eyes
Stealing the life of mine

I believe in you
I can show you that
I can see right through
All your empty lies
I won't last long
In this world so wrong

[Chorus]
Say goodbye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Hold on
Hold on (Oh)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Say goodbye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Hold on
Hold on
[Outro]
(Ooh)
