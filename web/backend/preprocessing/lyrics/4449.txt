1 ContributorPablo LyricsVerse 1: Yh Sipping vodka , tell that girl relax tho
Homie seprentolavis
Shoot my shot ,Negredo.none of y’all man dan know. Why you talk Wells Fargo? Fantasy Land bitch . I’m Escobar Da Pablo
Keeping on barely we repping the bando
Partially part of me like Othello
Tell them my story, I’m better and better
Tell me you love me, go suck on antenna
Nobody loves you when shit go South. You heard you a faker but not from my mouth
Easy to see and harder to doubt 
Fam I’m Pablo,King of the Racks

Bridge: Life is a dream I’m working it out (working it out)
What do you think is happening now( in Fantasy Land)?
Money and bitches these are addictions . I don’t realize,better don’t give me advice
Vvs and the Lamborghini on the line

Verse 2: Top of the building
Push off the victim
Do for the milli
Everybody got a bad side, but a few are the realest
Pablo in  panama
Imma need help but I’m back to the caravan
Where are all my squad we dy gather now
Fresh boys but we actually gangsters
Richy K , Rex  Dave, Dollar
Rap clouds we holy Medina

Verse 2: Just got a call from my homie that's Lifestyle
Once we talked I know that the track we'll be a death
Rivers state red liquid flowing
Forbiden fruit stock on my teeth that is why I smile
I know that's crunch time
Comparison sounding like a human and God prime
We are not alike and my nigga yeah that's right
Straight from Believes mind
There ain't ice on my neck yeah yeah
That ain't mean am not cold like berges yeah yeah
Your shot on target miss and regret yeah yeah
Riichy owner all you'll are pets yeah yeah, yeah!

(Lifestyle Szn)
Verse 3:Fiends love crack and take no precautions
I’m really so anxious 
Shit getting real as time goes by as my homie dies, just tears no caption
His love for weed as he grazed , he owned a pasture
His pastor spoke to him , ‘turn a new leaf’ but my fam damn so stubborn
Condolences can’t condole all these rappers
Where were you when an activist first was popping actavis?
I’m pablo picasso, man of Valour
Building a Castle and buried my brothers
A childish dream is a fucking nightmare
I be repping blocks,head for the climax , nigga oh my God
(Riichy K)
How do you compare with a whole divine click
Am Riichy 10 you'll whacky races
My enemies all have stupid faces
I made the race never tie(d) don't suit me
You loosing race ooh damn am a racist
I fuck the game so they tag me rapist
Been built from base while you'll bath in basins
My brain so sharp, I stand, weapons raising
Now am half amazing like Nas did raise me
Never have to brag about what I don't have
Like 2face talking new hair
My own style is like ghost flair
The only man that makes ghost fear
