Huh!

[Verse 1]
I'm outta luck, outta love
Gotta photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one I wanna touch

[Verse 2]
I see your face every time I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild and free, so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh-oh, look what you've done

[Chorus]
(Photograph)
I don't want your (Photograph)
I don't need your (Photograph)
All I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough

Put your hurt on me, if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child, oh

You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild and free, so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

All I've got is a photograph
You've gone straight to my head
