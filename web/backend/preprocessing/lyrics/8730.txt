Please bring me back to life
I'm stuck too deep inside
Please take my hand
I wanna make you mhm, mmm

[Chorus]
Try to look fresher
Try to live better
I gotta get out of bed
I need a good kick, kick in the head
Try to lose pressure
Try to move faster
I gotta get out of bed
I need a good kick, kick in the head (Uh)

[Verse 1]
I know you're tired, tired of fightin' the world
I know you had it, it slipped out from under you, girl
I can't be honest, honest isn't kind
This ain't the hardest, you'll keep on fallin' behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Please bring me back to lifе
I'm stuck too deep inside
Please takе my hand
I wanna make you everything I got
It's easier to sleep
Than let go of my dreams
Please take my hand
I wanna make ya mhm, mmm

My motivation's smilin' from the heart
My inspiration, it always sets foot in the dark
And I can't change it, the spiral in my mind
You are my favorite, for you, I'll pretend like I'm fine

[Pre-Chorus]
Please bring me back to life
I'm stuck too deep inside
Please take my hand
I wanna make you everything I got
It's easier to sleep
