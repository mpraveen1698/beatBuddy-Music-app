9 Contributors​in my bag Lyrics[Intro]
Dial it back (Ayy)
Flashback (Ayy)
To the time when you didn't show me love back (No love)
Fall back, it's all bad (All bad)
I don't got no time to talk for small bags (I need big bags!)

[Verse 1]
Who knew I would be the one, yeah
I knew, I knew, I knew (Ooh)
Talented, but they don't work as hard as I do, I do
Running on E, talk big game can't run it on me
Upping that fee, leveled up baby I'm outta ya reach (Your reach, your reach)
Yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Passed on me, but I’m taking all the shots now (Shots)
If they try to bring me down, they getting boxed out (Boxed out)
Thought you had it all together, you look lost now

[Chorus]
It's time to get in my bag, run up a check, pick up thе slack
Yeah, yeah
Front me thе bag, I'm good with that, I'll get it back
Yeah, yeah
Looking for me, I've been right here (Right here)
But you too busy switching sides, yeah
It's time to get in my bag, run up a check, pick up the slack
Yeah, yeah
Front me the bag, I'm good with that, I'll get it back
Yeah, yeah
Looking for me, I've been right here (Ayy)
But you too busy switching sides, yeah

Left my ego at the door, I’m seeing better days
I dot my I's, I put the work in, check my resume
They ain't checked on me before, but now they asking, "Where you at?" (Where you at?)
No I can’t hear you, I’m too deep inside this bag
Did you wrong, ain't a loss, cut ‘em off, that'll get you right (Ooh, yeah)
Had to coast, through the lows, took a while tryna find my light
Look at all that we got, who'd a thought we could live this life (Live it)
Run it up, live it up, do the most, yeah I just might

[Chorus]
It's time to get in my bag, run up a check, pick up the slack
Yeah, yeah
Front me the bag, I'm good with that, I'll get it back
Yeah, yeah
Looking for me, I've been right here (Right here)
But you too busy switching sides, yeah
It's time to get in my bag, run up a check, pick up the slack
Yeah, yeah
Front me the bag, I'm good with that, I'll get it back
Yeah, yeah
Looking for me, I've been right here (Ayy)
But you too busy switching sides, yeah
