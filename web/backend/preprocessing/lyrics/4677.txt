1 ContributorFade Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you remember when
We were only friends?
We walked an open road together
And, oh, ten years flew by
And you're still on my mind
Feels like the road goes on forever

[Refrain]
People in places, they're drifting away
Hope they don't get caught in the pouring rain
Maybe we'll meet up again someday
So I raise my glass to you

[Pre-Chorus]
You could be a hundred miles away
Lost in the Milky Way
Not gonna let you fade away
Are you out on the Golden Coast?
Hey, only Heavens knows
Not gonna let you fade away

[Chorus]
Let you fade away
Let you fade away
I won't let you fade away
You might be far away
You might also like[Drop]
I won't let you fade away
I won't let you fade away

[Verse 2]
I've been writing stories
And holding on to the glory
And to the words I never used
So I keep writing songs
And hope the day will come
My words will find their way to you

[Refrain]
People in places, they're drifting away
Hope they don't get caught in the pouring rain
Maybe we'll meet up again someday
So I raise my glass to you

[Pre-Chorus]
You could be a hundred miles away
Lost in the Milky Way
Not gonna let you fade away
Are you out on the Golden Coast?
Hey, only Heavens knows
Not gonna let you fade away
[Chorus]
Let you fade away
Let you fade away
I won't let you fade away
You might be far away

[Drop]
I won't let you fade away
I won't let you fade away
Let you fade away
I won't let you fade away
You might be far away
I won't let you fade awayEmbed Fade Away Fade Away Morgan Page;VIVID house
