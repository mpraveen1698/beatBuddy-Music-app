[Verse 1: Brad Petering]
Are you sick of me?
Would you like to be?
I'm tryin' to tell you somethin'
Somethin' that I already said
You like a pretty boy
With a pretty voice
Who is tryin' to sell you somethin'
Somethin' that you already have

[Chorus: Brad Petering, Brad Petering & Faith Harding]
But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right
She might let you stay, but just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along
She might want a kiss before the end of the song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothin'
And leave you with nothin'

[Verse 2: Brad Petering]
While the others talked
We were listenin' to Lover's Rock
In her bedroom
In her bedroom
And if you start to kiss
And the record skips
Flip it over
And sit a little closer

But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right
She might let you stay, but just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along
She might want a kiss before the end of the song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothin'
And leave you with nothin'
[Dialogue: Lafitte & Constance]
Now, how many men have you kissed?
Very few. 
But you offered me a kiss. Why?
Such a foolish reason, I'm afraid. I just wanted to kiss you. 

[Bridge: Brad Petering]
Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du

[Outro: Brad Petering, Faith Harding, Brad Petering & Faith Harding]
Because love can burn like a cigarette (Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)
(Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)
And leave you with nothin' (Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)
And leave you with nothin' (Du)21Embed Lovers Rock French Exit TV Girl indie
