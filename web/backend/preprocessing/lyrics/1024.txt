Early in the mornin' I still get a little bit nervous
Fightin' my anxiety constantly, I try to control it
Even when I know it's been forever, I can still feel the spin
Hurts when I remember, and I never wanna feel it again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know if you get it 'cause I can't express how thankful I am
That you were always with me when it hurts, I know that you'd understand

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose control
Nothin' I can do anymore
Tryin' every day when I hold my breath
Spinnin' out in space pressin' on my chest
I don't wanna lose control

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I still think it's comin', but I know it's not
Tryin' to breathe in and then out, but the air gets caught
'Cause even though I'm older now and I know how to shake off the past
I wouldn't have made it if I didn't have you holdin' my hand

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose control
Nothin' I can do anymore
Tryin' every day when I hold my breath
Spinnin' out in space pressin' on my chest
I don't wanna lose control

I need you to know I would never be this strong without you
You've seen how I grow, you took all my doubts
'Cause you were home

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose control
There's nothin' I can do anymore
I don't wanna lose control (Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
Nothin' I can do anymore (Anymore), anymore
Tryin' every day when I hold my breath
Spinnin' out in space pressin' on my chest (Pressin' on my chest)
I don't wanna lose control27Embed Control Control Zoe Wees german
