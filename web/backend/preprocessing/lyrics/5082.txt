11 ContributorsAfterLife Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've heard the rumors that the rumors all were true
They may be looking for me (They may be looking for me)
But they're coming for you (But they're coming for you)
I'll paint a picture you can better understand
They promise diamonds (They promise diamonds)
But they pay in sand

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes on and on and on and on and on
It's an old, broken record stuck on the same song
It goes on and on and on and on and on
You all know it's wrong, but you're singing along

[Chorus]
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for heaven to change me
I don't wanna have to wait for the fall
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for heaven to change things
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for hеaven to change this
I don't wanna have to fall on thе knife
(I don't wanna wait)
Forever after, this disaster
Bring the AfterLife

You'd cut your nose off just to spite your fuckin' face
That's who you are (That's who you are)
You know your place (You know your place)
You let them lead you by the throat with broken hands
So how's the view beneath their shoe (and what's your plan?)

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes on and on and on and on and on
It's an old, broken record stuck on the same song
It goes on and on and on and on and on
We all know it's wrong, but we're singing along

[Chorus]
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for heaven to change me
I don't wanna have to wait for the fall
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for heaven to change things
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for heaven to change this
I don't wanna have to fall on the knife
(I don't wanna wait)
Forever after, this disaster
Bring the AfterLife
[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I don't wanna wait for heaven to change me
I don't wanna wait (I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for heaven (heaven)
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait for heaven to save us
I don't wanna wait (I don't wanna wait)
I don't wait for heaven to save us
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait

[Chorus]
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for heaven to change me
I don't wanna have to wait for the fall
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for heaven to change things
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for heaven to change this
I don't wanna have to fall on the knife
(I don't wanna wait)
Forever after, this disaster
