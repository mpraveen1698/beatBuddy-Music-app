Hold me close and hold me fast
This magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose
When you kiss me heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

[Verse 2]
When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom
And when you speak
Angels sing from above
Everyday words seem
To turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be la vie en rose

[Verse 3]
And when you speak
Angels sing from above
Everyday words seem
To turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be la vie en roseYou might also like3Embed La Vie En Rose La Vie En Rose Daniela Andrade folk
