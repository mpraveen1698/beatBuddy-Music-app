5 Contributors​serotonin highs (feat. Allen Haley) Lyrics[Chorus: Arden Jones]
I wrote a song about you last night
And I can't lie
It's still in my head
I remember the hook was about our lives
Serotonin highs
That haven't happen yet

[Part 1: Arden Jones]
I'm nothing but a boy from the 415
She ain't nothing but a girl who got hope in her eyes
I ain't saying I got everything you need but
I'll be on your team, by your side when you sleep at night
Wait up, you're being serious?
Are you for real?
I guess I forgot exactly how it feels
I rest my head slowly go to bed
But as soon as I'm up, I run to you
You got me skipping meals
I been falling under
Your disguise nothing like I've ever seen
I don't wanna wondеr (wanna wonder)

[Chorus: Arden Jones]
I wrote a song about you last night
And I can't lie
It's still in my hеad
I remember the hook was about our lives
Serotonin highs
That haven't happen yet
And It goes like

Serotonin highs All up in my body
She just call me daddy
Oh she's acting kinda naughty
I'm a player most the time
But now I love it when she call me
Tell me all about her day
And tell em' what I'd be feeling If I were singing
La La La
In my car on my way to you
Play that song think of us
And what we can do
Life can feel like a trip
But we're me and you
We can make It work
I know me and you quite the special two
I been falling under
Your disguise nothing like I've ever seen
I don't wanna wonder
You decide If you wanna stick with me
Say I been falling under
Your disguise nothing like I've ever seen
I don't wanna wonder (wanna wonder)

[Chorus: Arden Jones]
I wrote a song about you last night
And I can't lie
It's still in my head
I remember the hook was about our lives
Serotonin highs
That haven't happen yet
And It goes like
