1 ContributorStranger Lyrics[Intro]
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger

[Verse 1]
I can feel your body, yeah
It's in your eyes I see you want it
You crave it, you need this, yeah
So come get it, I've got it, yeah

[Chorus]
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger

'Cause I'vе been waiting all night
I don't need something right
And I feel I'm pulling you in
You don't need another one
I'll bе everything you ever want
Ever want

Don't need a heart tonight
Just wanna a body moving side to side
Don't think about it, boy, just move for me
Move for me, move for me

[Chorus]
(Kiss me like a stranger)
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger

Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger
Kiss me like a stranger
Come and taste my flavour
You don't need no chaser
Just vibe on my danger)
