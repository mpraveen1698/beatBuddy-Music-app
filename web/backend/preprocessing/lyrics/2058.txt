27 ContributorsLasting Lover Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know why I can't quite
Get you out my sight
You're always just behind
Each thought across my mind
Keep crawling back to where we last
Left our love on hold
I'm always out for more
So what you waiting for?

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait, before you burn me to the ground
Please stay till the beat of our heart runs out

[Chorus]
I don't wanna let go, let go
'Cause I've been tryna hold on for so long
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away
She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover"
Save me, save me
From every single heartache, heartache
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away
She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover"

She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover"

[Verse 2]
One by one and two by twice
I've watched all my loves
Move on to something more
Up and out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
Caught in-between every passing hour
Oh, please stay until the taste of your love turns sour

[Chorus]
I don't wanna let go, let go
'Cause I've been tryna hold on for so long
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away
She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover"
Save me, save me
From every single heartache, heartache
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away
She said, "I've been looking for a lover"

[Bridge]
So let me know, did we ever mean anything at all?
So let me know, did we ever mean anything at all?
[Chorus]
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away
She said, "Didn't hurt me"
Ooh, I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away
She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover"

[Outro]
I've been looking for a lasting lover
Oh, I've been looking for a lasting lover1Embed Lasting Lover Lasting Lover Sigala;James Arthur house
