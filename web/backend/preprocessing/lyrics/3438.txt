[Verse 1]
Forty days and forty nights
I waited for a girl like you to come and save my life
Recall the days I waited for you
You know the ones who said I'd never find someone like you

[Chorus]
'Cause you were out of my league
All the things I believed
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you were more than just a dream
You were out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die, don't wake me
'Cause you are more than just a dream

[Bridge]

From time to time I pinch myself
Because I think my girl mistakes me for somebody else
And every time she takes my hand
All the wonders that remain become a simple fact

[Chorus]
'Cause you were out of my league
All the things I believed
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you were more than just a dream
You were out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die, don't wake me
'Cause you are more than just a dream

[Chorus]
'Cause you were out of my league
All the things I believed
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you were more than just a dream
You were out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die, don't wake me
'Cause you are more than just a dream

[Post-Chorus]
(More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more)
More than just a dream
(More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more)
More than just a dream

More than just a dream
(More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more)
More than just a dream
