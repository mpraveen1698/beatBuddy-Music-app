You said your favorite kinda weather is a rainy day
And it's rainin' in LA
You said, "Let's drive, I wanna take you to my favorite place
And it's not that far away"

[Verse 1: Jake Scott]
I know you're afraid of jumping in too fast
Because your heart is still healing
It'd be a shame to waste the chemistry we have
So let's stay in the feeling, and

[Chorus: Jake Scott]
Even if it doesn't work out
Even if it doesn't make sense
And you never see me again
Can we just be happy now?
Even if we burn this down
Even if we can't be friends
'Cause you hate me in the end
Can we just be happy now?

[Verse 2: Josie Dunne, Josie Dunne & Jake Scott]
My heart is beggin' not to let my head get in the way
And I think you feel the same
Scared I might be falling for you way too fast
Because my heart is still healing
But how can I say no when you've been lookin' at me like that?
So let's not overthink it, and
You might also like[Chorus: Both]
Even if it doesn't work out
Even if it doesn't make sense
And you never see me again
Can we just be happy now?
Even if we burn this down
Even if we can't be friends
'Cause you hate me in the end
Can we just be happy?

[Post-Chorus: Both]
And all that I know is here in this moment
Sun is still settin' over the ocean
And you're still kissin' me, so
Can we just be happy?
And here in this light, the green in your eyes is all that I see
I'm right where I wanna be, so
Can we just be happy now?

[Bridge: Josie Dunnie & Jake Scott]
Can we, can we, can we be happy now?
Happy now, happy now

[Chorus: Jake Scott, Both]
Even if it doesn't work out
Even if it doesn't make sense
Can we just be happy now?
Even if we burn this down
And we can't be friends, oh
Can we just be happy?
Even if it doesn't work out
Even if it doesn't make sense
And you never see me again
Can we just be happy now?
Even if we burn this down (Burn this down)
Even if we can't be friends
'Cause you hate me in the end
Can we just be happy?
[Post-Chorus: Both]
And all that I know is here in this moment
Sun is still settin' over the ocean
And you're still kissin' me, so
Can we just be happy?
And here in this light, the green in your eyes is all that I see
I'm right where I wanna be, so
Can we just be happy now?

[Outro: Josie Dunnie & Jake Scott, Both]
Can we be happy now?
(Happy now, happy now) Can we just be happy now?
Can we be happy now?
Can we just be happy now?Embed CWJBHN TWENTYTWENTY Jake Scott;Josie Dunne indie-pop
