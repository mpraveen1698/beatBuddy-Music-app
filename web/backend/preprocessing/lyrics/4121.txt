16 ContributorsFrankenstein Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, can we get some cow bells?

[Verse 1]
I'm so sick
Of all these pretty boys tryna act like the shit
And I just wish
They wouldn't fall in love, then leave me so quick

[Pre-Chorus]
I been searching, don't think it's out there
Talks for hours, walks in with flowers
Dirty converse, 6'2 and brown hair
Every little thing that I want

[Chorus]
Guess I gotta build my Frankenstein
Draw the picture, color all the lines
When it's right, I'll take a test drive
Every little thing that I want

[Verse 2]
When I'm mad
He'll kiss me till I'm numb and not treat me so bad
And he makes me laugh
He's never on my nerves, gets along with my dad (My dad)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I been searching, don't think it's out there
Oh so loyal, makes me feel spoiled
He's my daydream, never a nightmare
Every little thing that I want

[Chorus]
Guess I gotta build my Frankenstein
Draw the picture, color all the lines
When it's right, I'll take a test drive
Every little thing that I want
Guess I gotta build my Frankenstein
Draw the picture, color all the lines
When it's right, I'll take a test drive
Every little thing that I want

[Bridge]
Every little thing that I want
Every little thing that I want
Clap, clap

[Chorus]
Guess I gotta build my Frankenstein
Draw the picture, color all the lines
When it's right, I'll take a test drive
Every little thing that I want
Guess I gotta build my Frankenstein
Draw the picture, color all the lines
When it's right, I'll take a test drive
Every little thing that I want5Embed Frankenstein Frankenstein Claire Rosinkranz indie-pop
