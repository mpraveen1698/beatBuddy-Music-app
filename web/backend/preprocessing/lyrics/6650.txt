I am not a woman, I'm a god
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
Keep your heart 'cause I already—

[Verse 1]
Every day, I got a smile where my frown goes
A couple bodies in the garden where the grass grows
I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase
Maybe I could be a different human in a new place

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh
I just wanna feel somethin', tell me where to go
'Cause everybody knows somethin' I don't wanna know
So I stay right here 'cause I'm bеtter all alone
Yeah, I'm bеtter all alone
But

[Chorus]
I am not a woman, I'm a god
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
So keep your heart 'cause I already got one
I am not a woman, I'm a god
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
Keep your heart 'cause I already—
[Verse 2]
Every morning, got a hollow where my heart goes
I never listen, but I see it with my eyes closed
I know you, I remember from the grass stain
Maybe I could be a better human with a new name

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh
I just wanna feel somethin', tell me where to go
'Cause everybody knows somethin' I don't wanna know
So I stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone
Yeah, I'm better all alone
But

[Chorus]
I am not a woman, I'm a god
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
So keep your heart 'cause I already got one
I am not a woman, I'm a god
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
Keep your heart 'cause I already— (Yeah)

[Bridge]
I'm ready to leave it, I'll go when I feel it
Got caught, both hands on the smokin' gun
I try, but I need it, it's hard, but I feel it
And it really does hurt when you love someone
Oh
I just wanna feel somethin', tell me where to go
'Cause everybody knows somethin' I don't wanna know
So I stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone
Yeah, I'm better all alone
