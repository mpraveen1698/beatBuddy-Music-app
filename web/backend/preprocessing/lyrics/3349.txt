Let's go to Hell together
We can burn forever
I got nothin' better to do
You know that I'm not a rebel
I just know the devil
Can't be much worse than me and you

[Verse 1]
Let's let this motherfucker burn to the ground
I lost a love that I thought I found
Took all the money out my account
I bought an eighth, then I bought a pound
Smoke it up 'til I can't hear sound
Flip the Earth and turn it upside down
Come on, baby, go southbound

[Verse 2]
There's a secret place in Arizona
You could never see it if you're sober
Opens up into a supernova, yah
It will never drop one degree colder
Feel the flames, the heat burnin' your shoulders
You'll be fine when this thing's all over, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Let's go to Hell together
We can burn forever
I got nothin' better to do (I got nothin' better)
You know that I'm not a rebel (Yeah)
I just know the devil (I know him)
Can't be much worse than me and you
Let's go to Hell together (Together)
We can go whenever (Whenever)
Hold me down 'cause we're goin' fast (Ooh, baby)
I'll be your one ride-or-dier (Dier)
Through the smoke and fire (Fire)
Love the good times, they never last (Nah)

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
Let that motherfucker burn down (Burn it down, yeah)
Now you and you, do what you gotta do
But we gon' dance like we in downtown
Move it, move it now to the music
This fever dream is so lucid
Your life is super confusin'
Baby, it's hard to be human, yeah, uh
Runnin' red like we ain't wreckin'
No seat belt on, we ain't checkin'
Baby, you think this is Heaven?

[Chorus]
Let's go to Hell together (Together)
We can burn forever (Forever)
I got nothin' better to do (I got nothin' better)
You know that I'm not a rebel (Rebel)
I just know the devil (The devil)
Can't be much worse than me and you (Oh, baby, yeah)
Let's go to Hell together (Together)
We can go whenever (Whenever)
Hold me down 'cause we're goin' fast (We're goin' fast)
I'll be your one ride-or-dier (Dier)
Through the smoke and fire (Fire)
Love the good times, they never last
[Outro]
Oh, they never last, they never lastEmbed Let's go to Hell Let's go to Hell Tai Verdes indie-pop
