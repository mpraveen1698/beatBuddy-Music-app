37 ContributorsAffection Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know that you say I get mean when I'm drinking, but
Then again, sometimes I get really sweet so
What does it mean if I tell you to go fuck yourself?
Or if I say that you're beautiful to me?

[Chorus]
It's affection, always
Ooh, you're gonna see it someday
My attention for you
Even if it's not what you need

[Verse 2]
Sometimes we talk all night long, we don't shut up
And when it's late, we'll say we're still wide awake so
We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me
And we'll rent a car and we'll drive upstate

[Chorus]
It's affection, always
Ooh, you're gonna see it someday
My attention's on you
Even if it's not what you need

[Bridge]
I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you
