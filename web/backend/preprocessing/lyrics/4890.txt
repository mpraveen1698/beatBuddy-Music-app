[Verse 1]
Us, and them
And after all, we're only ordinary men
Me, and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do

[Chorus]
"Forward!" he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
The general sat, and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

[Verse 2]
Black and blue
And who knows which is which, and who is who?
Up and down
And in the end, it's only round and round, and round

[Chorus]
"Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried
"Listen, son," said the man with the gun
"There's room for you inside"

"I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So like, if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again
Dig it? I mean, he got off light
'Cause I could've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of right and wrong, innit?
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing, do they, eh?"
[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
Down and out
It can't be helped, but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?

[Chorus]
Out of the way, It's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice
