7 ContributorsHeaven Lyrics[Verse 1]
Beautiful soul
You're outta control
Dance like there's nobody that be watchin' you
Chasin' the thrill
With powder and pills
It's a girl's world and everybody's in it

[Pre-Chorus]
I try to fight the feelin' (Feelin')
But I think I'm past the ceilin'

[Chorus]
It feels like heaven (Ah)
Watchin' you move and dance
It feels like heaven, lost in you
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
It feels like heaven (Ah)
Watchin' you move and dance
It feels like heaven, lost in you
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
So out of my mind
I don't care, it's fine
At least I'm not tryin' to be somethin' I'm not
We're too cool to sing
Superficial things
I'm just happy you are who you are
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I try to fight the feelin'
But I think I'm past the cеilin'
I know that we should slow down
But we're way past sеlf-control now

[Chorus]
It feels like heaven (Ah)
Watchin' you move and dance
It feels like heaven, lost in you
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
It feels like heaven (Ah)
Watchin' you move and dance
It feels like heaven, lost in you
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
Ooh, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Heaven
Ooh, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
