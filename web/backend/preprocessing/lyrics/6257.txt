Rilès you're arrogant
You lift yourself up, you believed in your craft when nobody did
But we say arrogant
You dont know the game, you keep mentionning my name, "We dont like what you s-"

[Verse 2]
They all want me dead, I piss them off, that's what I like to
You're sending me death threats in my mailbox, Mama we gon' move
Talk to me 'fore your talk 'bout me, yeah that's the number 1 rule
Many want my head, but where's the crown? It's on my balls fool!
Wow, wow, great, great
Don't show them that you've been loving yourself
Say you're ugly, say you're not the best, don't pump yourself up, they don't like them speeches

Now I got girls who want my d*** and crazy dudes who want my head
