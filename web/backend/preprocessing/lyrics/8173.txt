2 ContributorsPour a Little Heaven on Me Lyrics[Verse 1:]
I’m staring at a blank page
The words I cannot find
A chapter is unwritten
I see outside the lines

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I won’t get caught if I try to catch
Another shooting star so I can make a wish
Today is when the chapter will begin

[Chorus:]
Pour a little heaven on me
So I can keep shining
Pour a little heaven on me
So I can keep smiling
Another breath, another way
Gonna make it through another day
Pour a little heaven on me
Pour it on me

[Verse 2:]
The wheels just keep on turning
Like broken carousel
Buying all distractions
Like everybody else
You might also like[Pre-Chorus:]
And I won’t get caught if I try to catch
Another shooting star so I can make a wish
Today is when the chapter will begin

[Chorus:]
Pour a little heaven on me
So I can keep shining
Pour a little heaven on me
So I can keep smiling
Another breath, another way
Gonna make it through another day
Pour a little heaven on me
Pour it on me

[Bridge:]
The open roads are finding me
A hopeful hide in every sea
As I’m looking to the highway
Got some blue skies in the right place
I run myself and back again
From NYC to Disneyland
Letting go of all the memories
Giving fate a chance to catch me
To catch me, to catch me
Oooooh, ooh
[Chorus:]
Pour a little heaven on me
So I can keep shining
Pour a little heaven on me
So I can keep smiling
Pour a little heaven on me
So I can keep shining
Pour a little heaven on me
So I can keep smiling
Another breath, another way
Gonna make it through another day
Pour a little heaven on me
Pour a little heaven on me
Oooh
Pour a little heaven on me
Oooh, yeahEmbed Hopeful Hopeful Unwritten Skies sleep
