8 ContributorsDo It All Again Lyrics[Intro]
We'll do it all again when all the lights go down, 'til we both pass out
Then we come back 'round

[Verse 1]
Tell me everything
Tell me all your deepest secrets, be my remedy, yeah
If I lose my way
Will you bring me back to focus, be my clarity? Huh

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you been on my mind but all I find is nothing by the morning
By the morning
And all that's left is the emptiness but no regrets 'cause you know that I want it

[Chorus]
We'll do it all again when all the lights go down, 'til we both pass out
Then we come back 'round
We'll do it all again when all thе lights go down, 'til we both pass out
Then we comе back 'round
Oh, you know we'll do it all again

[Post-Chorus]
And again
And again
When the lights go down, we'll do it all again
And again
And again
Oh, you know

It feels so innocent
'Til we go back 'round in circles right back here again, yeah
You're my adrenaline
It should hurt so good and we should both be sick of it, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you been on my mind but all I find is nothing by the morning
By the morning
And all that's left is the emptiness but no regrets 'cause you know that I want it

[Chorus]
We'll do it all again when all the lights go down, 'til we both pass out
Then we come back 'round
We'll do it all again when all the lights go down, 'til we both pass out
Then we come back 'round
Oh, you know we'll do it all again

[Post-Chorus]
And again
And again
When the lights go down, we'll do it all again
And again
And again
When the lights go down, we'll do it all againEmbed Do It All Again Do It All Again Punctual;Jordan Shaw edm
