1 ContributorRenegade - (Slowed + Reverb) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Keep your hands right there
I popped two more, she's in my mind somewhere
Won't let my mind go there
I took too much, don't let me drive nowhere, oh
Keep your eyes on mine
And if you want I'll tell you lies
Tell you I'm yours for life
And tell your friend she's next in line

[Hook]
Ohh, should've listened to them
Ohh, don't you know what I am?
Ohh, didn't you listen to them?
Ohh, don't you know what I am?

[Verse 2]
Keep the drugs real close
One more line before I ovеrdose
And no one evеr knows
She's on my mind when I'm on yours
I'm not here for games
I told you what it is, you chose to stay
Baby, you chose the pain
Cause you don't know me, you just know my name
You might also like[Hook]
Ohh, should've listened to them
Ohh, don't you know what I am?
Ohh, didn't you listen to them?
Ohh, don't you know what I am?
