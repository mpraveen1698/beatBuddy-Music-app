19 ContributorsIf I Go, Iâ€™m Goin Lyrics[Verse 1: Gregory Alan Isakov]
This house, she's holdin' secrets
Got my change behind the bed
In a coffee can I throw my nickels in
Just in case I have to leave

[Chorus: Gregory Alan Isakov & Brandi Carlile, Gregory Alan Isakov]
I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
If I go, I'm goin' shameless
Let my hunger take me there

[Verse 2: Gregory Alan Isakov]
This house, she's quite the talker
She creaks and moans, she keeps me up
And the photographs know I'm a liar
They just laugh as I burn her down

[Chorus: Gregory Alan Isakov & Brandi Carlile, Gregory Alan Isakov]
I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
If I go, I'm goin' on fire
Let my anger take me there

[Bridge: Gregory Alan Isakov & Brandi Carlile, Gregory Alan Isakov]
And the shingles, man, they're shakin'
Back door's burnin' through
This old house, she's quite the keeper
Quite the keeper of you

Let my darlin' take me there
