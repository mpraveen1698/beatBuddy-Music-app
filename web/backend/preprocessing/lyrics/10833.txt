1 ContributorIâ€™d Hate Me Too Lyrics[Verse 1]
Had so much patience and I hate it
I tried to embrace it, I faced it
Through bad days but I learned to wake up without you, you
Learned to wake up without you

[Pre-Chorus]
Thought it was love but you're just a drug
And, ooh, it was never enough for us

[Chorus]
I let you change me
And if I were you, I'd hate me too
And you'd love to blame me
For all the things you'd make me do
Worried 'bout me
It's always the little things
The more that I think, the less I'm afraid of
The ways that you changed me
And if I were you, I'd hate me too

[Verse 2]
Knew you were bad news, when I had you
And it's fucked up, we got tattoos that matched
To hold on to, what's fading to fake like it's new, new
It's stained in my heart and I knew
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
That it wasn't love 'cause you're just a drug
And I knew it was never enough for us

[Chorus]
I let you change me
And if I were you, I'd hate me too
And you'd love to blame me
For all the things you'd make me do
Worried 'bout me
It's always the little things
The more that I think, the less I'm afraid of
The ways that you changed me
And if I were you, I'd hate me tooEmbed I'd Hate Me Too Here, just for now gavn! sad
