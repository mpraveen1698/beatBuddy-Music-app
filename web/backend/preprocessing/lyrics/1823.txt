Sunrise, sunrise looks like mornin' in your eyes
But the clock's held 9:15 for hours
Sunrise, sunrise couldn't tempt us if it tried
'Cause the afternoon's already come and gone

[Chorus]
And I said, "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
To you

[Verse 2]
Surprise, surprise, couldn't find it in your eyes
But I'm sure it's written all over my face
Surprise, surprise, never something I could hide
When I see we made it through another day

[Chorus]
And I said, "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
To you

[Bridge]
Now, the night will throw its cover down
Mm, on me again
Ooh, and if I'm right, it's the only way
To bring me back
