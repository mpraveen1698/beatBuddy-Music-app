2 ContributorsSoldiers of Aizen (Espada Cypher) Lyrics[Verse 1: Coyote Starrk ($pitnotic)]
Just leave me alone, off-loud, I'm setting the tone
My wrist Rosetta the stone
You weak, we ain't getting along, so get out my phone
They deceased for the end of the tone
Man of the Iron - it's Starrk to your dome
You will drop dead, if you get in my zone
They know I'm the one, but I do not condone
Facing a Zero, my Cero is calm
I say I'm alone, but I roll with a pack
You pull up alone, then I roll up a pack
I keep it on me, you know where it's at
Don't need no Sonido, I'm there in a flash, bitch
Prеdicament on me ain't past tensе
Tearing through ligaments past tense
Know they be wishing my absence
This devil that copied your dance steps

[Verse 2: Barragan Louisenbairn (Hajjioka Corporation [VHS])]
I'll put an end to a beef who dares envy's the King
I'll empty this thing and dismantle the scene
Everybody going ghost, the boy Danny when he breathes
You're never overhead unless I'm using guillotine
And that's for a moment, step to my throne
I cut throats of opponents, and I tank explosions
Known to cause commotions with these pencil motions
If he's in a box, you can picture the scenes of my daily motions
Nothing about you is special
Only standing here 'cause I let you
Your existence, your purpose to serve me
You're worthless without me, I ain't even draw my blade yet
Position opposition in boxes
Checkmate, you couldn't even best me on my worst day
Fuck is you thinking in the first place, I'm defining the greatness
My reach is so vast, need the sky to contain it

Harribel be the one they wanna beat
Everybody wanna get bodybagged by me, yuh
Not the One, not the Two, but the Three
I promise, you'll be in defeat
Running up bags, while I charge for a feat
The shark like to bite, so just watch where you sleep
Slumming with Hollows, I eat up the beat
Olaazul - how I put 'em to sleep
Giving your spiritual pressure a run for its money
The drip is so crazy like a Beez making honey
The ocean is vast, so there ain't no running
I fear for the future of any opponent
I ain't tryna fight, but really who want it?
I ain't tryna bleed 'em, unless I get prompted
Now his roof gon' looking like he had a frontal
Shark week, I'mma show you how to be a hunter

[Verse 4: Nnoitra Gilga (Vanquish)]
Trust no bitch
I don't need nobody pray for the man that this
Gon' end quick
Pull out my four arms, and you know that they well-equipped
And you gon' get it when I pop it off, I do it
Rip one off, it pop right back improved, and
You just fighting shadows looking stupid
Chrome to dome, she really 'bout to lose it
Stab 'em in the back with no remorses
Ain't got time for friends, I'm stacking corpses
Piling up these tombs, so get your roses
Catch me at Las Noches - buenos noches
Santa Teresa te da en la cara
Talking 'bout Espada, watch your espalda
Talking like they big, but I hear blah blah
Queren "Arrancar" pero no hacen nada
[Verse 5: Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez (Jacob Cass)]
I'mma god ass nigga
When I transform, you'll see that I'mma dog ass nigga
I don't fight fair, you see that I'mma dog ass niggas
Put a Hollow in his tummy, better dodge that nigga
I'mma big dog, got big claws, cuttin' right through
Bitch lost, I'm pissed off, so I slice you
Whole crew a ghosts, you could catch me where the phantom lay
I'll give a nigga Ora's like I'm in the wrong anime
I really blew rounds in 'em like I hit 'em with the Cero
He get Jacked up, when rounds flying like a Sparrow
I am one nigga that you don't wanna meet with
Leave a nigga with these claw marks like a freak bitch
See this, look, I'm finna pop off
Known to talk heavy, take a look up at my rock jaw
It's a lost cause
They really got the blue up on my head like they payin' to get me knocked off

[Verse 6: Zommari Rureaux (Dtrey)]
Zommari Rureaux - how I rock
I sick clone after clone after clone on an opp
I'm the seventh Espada, but feel like the top
My Gemeles Sonido is too quick to stop
I got all eyes on me like Pac
Mi amor make you move like a prop
Embrion - I'm prepared for the drop
Zanpakuto turn your body to slop
Quit the hating, I'm anticipating
Your obliteration if I get impatient
Then it's adios to a weaker reaper
Now it's going down like you just hit the basement
Ain't a bone for mercy in my body
Aizen gave me purpose, now I'm feeling godly
Probably roaming Hueco Mundo in an Audi
Pull up to Las Noches, meet me in the lobby, ah
[Verse 7: Szayel Aporro Granz (Reyny Daze)]
Yeah, I walk in the room
I'm assumed I'm the dude who can be the most smooth with it
Ay, I just do what I do
And I plan every move 'till I go through with it
Like, who is you, who is you
You's a dead man walking when you step in my room
Better watch how you talking, better watch how you move
Only thing that I don't know is how to lose
How you gonna talk to me like I'm not the perfect creature?
I got twice your pay and twice your features
I got twice your fame, I'm on the speakers
I got four sight like a manga reader, so
Fuck you, man, this battles dull
I don't wanna beef, bitch, I'm already full
Take your Bankai back, I'mma bush your skull
I know everything about you, so your powers null

[Verse 8: Aaroniero Arruruerie (Kumodo Dragon)]
Mask off like fuck protocol
Need 'em dead, I'm the pro to call
Built a glass house, I'm still throwing rocks
You talking big when you the best overall
I'm like why is you trying me?
Hole in my heart from a soulless society
Walk the line, I'm still drunk with power, and I'm showing sobriety
Need my slice, fuck your piety, ain't no denying me
Uh, I turn you to rubble
Talking inaudible
Break out the huddle
First attempt at your eyes, and you seeing double
Ironic 'cause that was a quad
You spamming chat, I pull up like a mod with the mods
No way you can even the odds
Heaven-sent, I return you to god

[Verse 9: Yammy Riyalgo (Bonnie Acosta)]
You running with your block?
Yeah, I hear you talking bold for the rock
Well, let me really show you how I'm bolder
I keep 1-0 in my chest and my shoulder
My squad gon' breathe Hispanic, lil' boy tough? No need to panic
Stomp 'em 'till he speak a different language, now he speaking Spanish
I'm known 'round this bitch, got plate in jaw like I was Jon Jon
"Pound" his face for the "Dinero", that's the shit I'm on, son
I have it all
Man, I "focus" fire, I'm on Adderall
These rounds hitting like a cannonball
Keep a mouth blast like it's Dragon Ball, hit collateral's

[Verse 10: Ulqiorra Cifer (SSBeats)]
Who the man that'll get you in a heart attack
Ulqiorra in the building, better watch your back
I never play, I get the job done with a clash
And you bugging with your feeling, that some balderdash
I got you bitching like your Orihime
I never gave a shit of you on why you can't see me
I'm in another dimension, better stay off my mentions
If you fucking with me and then I bring deception, no question
I pull up with the shots with the power of my Cero
And I never stand down, man, I'm feeling like a Draco
About to get your arm severed like your boy Llargo
I'm the master with the sword when I'm squaring up with Ichigo
Ay yo, let me show you power that's all better than a Bankai
I know this ain't right, but it's good to be the bad guy
Fucking with the squad, and I send you all to sky high
Feeling high and it's neutral 'cause I like to keep it fly like

[Verse 11: Nelliel (Knight of Breath)]
Nel's gonna make you null, fool
Sword fight against me's too cruel
Elegant with a touch of cool
Either form I am sure to rule
Don't need to be full-fledged anymore
This group's not the only door
I vote for peace, not for war
You fight, but what is it for?
These Shinigami seem to get bolder
Won't shy away if I'm young, or I'm older
Numbers mean nothing, they're just place holders
I stay too focused, call it the cold shoulder
My days in the army service are over
But my warrior heart still beats like a soldier

[Verse 12: Aizen (KBN Chrollo)]
Look, this was a plan from the start
It was all figured out before you even had a heart
A simple calculation, you don't have to be smart
To figure out how I ran throughout the whole block
Hadouken was mine, that's the wrong line
But I guess it don't matter, unapproachable it's over ninety nine
You can't see me, you don't have to be blind
'Cause I illuminate interspace before the front lined
Soldiers are Hollow
Mask on, a mask hides the husk of a hallow
Better clear your thoughts before you jump up to follow
'Cause everything you once knew was only all the things I allowed you
Now ain't that surprising
As I walk to the throne, I'll leave you singing like Brison
I'm like the shiny
You will never get to know me, know the light right in front of you is Aizen

[Outro: KBN Chrollo]
Soldiers are Hollow
Mask on, a mask hides the husk of a hallow
Better clear your thoughts before you jump up to follow
'Cause everything you once knew was only all the things I allowed youEmbed We Don’t Need We Don’t Need Oliver Heldens;Piero Pirupa progressive-house
