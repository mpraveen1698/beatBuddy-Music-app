Can't take me apart!
Can't take me apart!

[Verse 1]
See the light, a new day has arrived for us
Genesis of our evolution
A linchpin holds within a means to an end
Can't you see that we are one?

Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
No, you can't!

[Pre-Chorus]
We see no end to the dream

[Chorus]
We will never see the end
We will never be the end
All my life, I've felt discarded
Never feeling a part of it

No, you can't!
You might also like[Verse 2]
Without me you will fade, you will not remain
We are one, and of the same future machine
A linchpin holds within a means to an end
Can't you see that we are one?

Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
Can't take me apart
No, you can't!

[Pre-Chorus]
We see no end to the dream

[Chorus]
We will never see the end
We will never be the end
All my life, I've felt discarded
Never feeling a part of it

[Bridge]
No, you
No, you can't take
No, you can't take
No, you can't take
No, you can't take
No, you can't take
No, you can't take me apart
[Chorus]
We will never see the end
We will never be the end
All my life, I've felt discarded
Never feeling a part of it

[Outro]
You can't change me
You can't change me
You can't change me
You can't change me
You can't change me
You can't change me
You can't change me now1Embed Linchpin Digimortal Fear Factory industrial
