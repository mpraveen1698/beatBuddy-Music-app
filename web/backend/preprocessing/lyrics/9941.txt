14 ContributorsI Believe In You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't believe in superstars
Organic food and foreign cars
I don't believe the price of gold
The certainty of growing old
That right is right and left is wrong
That north and south can't get along
That east is east and west is west
And being first is always best

[Chorus]
But I believe in love
I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad
And I believe in you

[Verse 2]
Well I don't believe that heaven waits
For only those who congregate
I like to think of God as love
He's down below, he's up above
He's watchin' people, everywhere
He knows who does and doesn't care
And I'm an ordinary man
Sometimes I wonder who I am
You might also like[Chorus]
But I believe in love
I believe in music
I believe in magic
And I believe in you

[Bridge]
I know with all my certainty
What's going on with you and me
Is a good thing
It's true
I believe in you

[Verse 3]
I don't believe virginity
Is as common as it used to be
In working days and sleeping nights
That black is black and white is white
That Superman and Robin Hood
Are still alive in Hollywood
That gasoline's in short supply
The rising cost of gettin' by

[Chorus]
But I believe in love
I believe in old folks
I believe in children
I believe in you
I believe in love
I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad
And I believe in you5Embed I Believe In You I Believe In You Don Williams country
