I build a fire in the snow
Warm our bodies from the cold
And you said, "If we never try. we'll never know
You have to sow the seed and watch it grow"

[Pre-Chorus]
Everywhere I go, all I ever see
Are all the little ways that used to be
People that I know only ever speak
Like everything is heading for catastrophe
There's nothing I could do, I don't get to choose
Even if I could rewrite the history
It's clear to see
That I'd still be

[Chorus]
Loving you
Loving you

[Verse 2]
This is bound to leave a mark
But I'll be proud to wear the scars
They tell a rich tale of disaster
About a love and what came after
I'll be frozen like a storm
Think we should take the long way home

Like everything is heading for catastrophe
There's nothing I could do, I don't get to choose
Even if I could rewrite the history
It's clear to see
That I'd still be

[Chorus]
Loving you
Loving you
