She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street, ow, girl
She likes the boys in the band
She says that I'm her all-time favorite
When I make my move to her room, it's the right time
She's never hard to please, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
That girl is pretty wild now
The girl's a super freak
The kind of girl you read about
In new-wave magazines
That girl is pretty kinky
The girl's a super freak
I really love to taste her
Every time we meet
She's alright, she's alright
That girl's alright with me, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky, yow
Everybody sing
Super freak, super freak

She's a very special girl
The kind of girl you want to know
From her head down to her toenails
Down to her feet, yeah
And she'll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends
In a limousine
Long and black and shining bright
Three's not a crowd to her, she says (Ménage à trois, oui la la)
"Room 714, I'll be waiting"
When I get there she's got incense, wine and candles
It's such a freaky scene

[Pre-Chorus]
That girl is pretty kinky
The girl's a super freak
The kind of girl you read about
In new-wave magazines
That girl is pretty wild now
The girl's a super freak
I really like to taste her
Every time we meet
She's alright, she's alright
That girl's alright with me, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
[Chorus]
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky, yow

[Bridge]
Temptations, sing
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Super freak, super freak
That girl's a super freak
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street
Blow, Danny
Oh, girl
