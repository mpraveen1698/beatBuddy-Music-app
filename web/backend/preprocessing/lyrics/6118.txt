12 ContributorsNo Games Lyrics[Intro]
Ah
Girl, I love you
Ah, eh, ah
It's, it's, it's Serani
Just in case you never know
Just in case you never know, oh, oh
Eh, ah

[Chorus]
Love you, girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah-ah
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
We've been together six months now (The most perfect days)
You pushed for us to exchange vows (Made me change my ways)
I gave my life over to you (Then you turned around)
After all that we've been through (I was your rebound)

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I want you (All time)
I'll forever love you (You're mine)
I'm not mad, even though I'm sad
('Cause you) Should give me one more chance
You might also like[Chorus]
Love you, girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah-ah
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Is this the life you really want (Constant delusion)
Your time with me was very fun (There's no illusion)
But I don't know you anymore
When you walked outside that door
You left your happiness

[Pre-Chorus]
But, girl, I want you (All time)
I'll forever love you (You're mine)
I'm not mad, even though I'm sad
('Cause you) Should give me one more chance

[Chorus]
Love you, girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah-ah
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah-ah

[Bridge]
'Cause you're my one and only
I'm still here feelin' lonely
Feelin' wasted, yeah-e-yeah, yeah-e-yeah, ah-ah
You're my sunshine, I need you back one more time
Ti-i-ime, time, ah-ah
[Chorus]
Love you, girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah-ah
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah-ah2Embed No Games No Games Serani dancehall
