I'm clumsy
Yeah my head's a mess, cause you got me
Growing taller everyday
We're giants in a little man's world
My heart is pumping up so big that it could burst

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars, and boats
I swear I could touch the sky

[Chorus]
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall

[Verse 2]
I'll be careful, so don't be afraid
You're safe here, no these arms won't let you break
I put up a sign in the clouds
So they all know that we ain't ever coming down

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars, and boats
I swear I could touch the sky

Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall

[Bridge]
You build me up
Make me what I never was
You build me up
From nothing into something
Yeah something from the dust

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars, and boats
I swear I could touch the sky

[Chorus]
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall39Embed Ten Feet Tall Forget The World (Deluxe) Afrojack;Wrabel house
