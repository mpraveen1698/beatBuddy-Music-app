5 ContributorsLove Again Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Something isn't right with us
I've been listening
Paying attention
You don't listen
You've been givin'
You've been spending up
Your time
Out there lying
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You're like Novocaine, Novocaine
Yeah
Poison in my brain, Novocaine
Yeah, ay, yeah
Novacaine, Novacaine

Paying attention
You don't listen
You've been givin'
You've been spending up
Your time
Out there lying
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
