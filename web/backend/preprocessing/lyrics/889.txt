18 ContributorsWaves (Robin Schulz Remix / Radio Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground
Touch the ground, and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Every time you are not around

[Chorus]
I'm slowly drifting away (Drifting away)
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the wave (Drifting away)
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away, drifting, drifting away)

[Verse 1]
My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground
Touch the ground, and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Every time you are not around

[Chorus]
I'm slowly drifting away (Drifting away)
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the
(Drifting away)
Wave after wave, wave after wave
Slowly drifting

I wish I could make it easy
Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach, to find a way
I'm stuck here in between
I'm looking for the right words to say

[Chorus]
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the wave3Embed Waves - Robin Schulz Radio Edit Waves (Robin Schulz Radio Edit) Mr. Probz;Robin Schulz house
