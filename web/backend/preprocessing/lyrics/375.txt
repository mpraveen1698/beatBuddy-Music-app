91 ContributorsHold On Lyrics[Verse 1]
Loving and fighting
Accusing, denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone
You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, "Please don't leave me!"?

[Chorus]
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

[Verse 2]
Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, "Please don't leave me!"

Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

[Bridge]
I don't wanna let go
I know I'm not that strong
I just wanna hear you
Saying "baby, let's go home"
Let's go home
Yeah, I just wanna take you home

[Outro]
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you60Embed Hold On Hold On Chord Overstreet acoustic
