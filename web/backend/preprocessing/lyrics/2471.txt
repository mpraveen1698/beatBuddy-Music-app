4 ContributorsTonight Lyrics[Intro]
Wow, demxntia

[Verse]
I know we both shared a past of regrets and scars (Regrets and scars)
But we can leave it behind and just run away far (Far, far)
We'll let the moon and the stars show us where we are tonight (Tonight)
Oh, oh, oh
I know we both like to laugh just like everyone else (Everyone else)
I know it seems like the world wants to take that away
So grab a hold of my hand and we can leave this place tonight (Tonight)
Ayy
