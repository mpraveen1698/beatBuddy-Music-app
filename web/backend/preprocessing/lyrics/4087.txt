I will always be with you
Doesn't matter what you do girl, oh girl with you
No matter what you do
I will always be around

Won't you tell me what you found girl, oh girl won't you
Knock down the old brick wall, and be a part of it all
Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
If you would give me all, as I would give it to you
Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be

No matter where you go
There will always be a place
Can't you see in my face girl, oh girl don't you
Knock down the old brick wall, and be a part of it all
Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
If you would give me all, as I would give it to you
Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be

No matter what you are
I will always be with you
Doesn't matter what you do girl, oh girl want you
Oh girl, you girl, want you
Oh girl, you girl, want youSee Badfinger LiveGet tickets as low as $71You might also likeEmbed No Matter What - Remastered 2010 No Dice (Remastered 2010 / Deluxe Edition) Badfinger j-rock
