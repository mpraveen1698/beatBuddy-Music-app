Open up
Feel the waves cut through me
Hypnotized
By the sounds I'm breathing in

[Refrain]
Hold tight, hold tight
Chemicals collide
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight

[Pre-Chorus]
Dripping lights, paint the skies
All because of you
Dripping lights, paint the skies
Only you

[Chorus]
Can make me move
You (You), you (You) can make me move
Can make me move
You (You), you (You) can make me move

[Post-Chorus]
Can make me
(You)
You (You), you (You) can make me move
Can make me

Hold tight, hold tight
Chemicals collide
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight

Dripping lights, paint the skies (Paint the skies)
All because of you (Of you, of you)
Dripping lights (Lights), paint the skies (Skies)
Only you
