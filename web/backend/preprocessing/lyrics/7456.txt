Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

[Verse 1]
It's five and I'm driving home again
It's hard to believe that it's my last time
The man on the wireless cries again
It's over, it's over

[Chorus]
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

[Verse 2]
It's late and I'm with my love alone
We drink to forget the coming storm
We love to the sound of our favorite song
Over and over

[Chorus]
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died
You might also like[Bridge]
It's time and we're in each others arms
It's time but I don't think we really care

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
