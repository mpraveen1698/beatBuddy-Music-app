Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we fly?
Know that I, know that I still care for you
But didn't we, didn't we say goodbye?

[Verse 1]
Swear I saw your face
At a coffee shop on 8th
Or maybe it was in my mind
And I swear that I heard your laugh
From a person that walked past me
At a party the other night

[Pre-Chorus]
Never thought we'd ever have to go without
Take you over anybody else, hands down
We're the type of melody that don't fade out
Don't fade out, can't fade out

[Chorus]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we fly?
Know that I, know that I still care for you
But didn't we, didn't we say goodbye?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we try?
Know that I, know that I still care for you
Tell me why good things have to die

Do you remember all those plans
That we made after too many drinks
In the kitchen of your brother's apartment
When life was like a wishing well
4:00 AM and raising hell
Damn, I knew you oh-so well

[Pre-Chorus]
Never thought we'd ever have to go without
Take you over anybody else, hands down
We're the type of melody that don't fade out
Don't fade out, can't fade out

[Chorus]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we fly?
Know that I, know that I still care for you
But didn't we, didn't we say goodbye?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we try?
Know that I, know that I still care for you
Tell me why good things have to die

[Bridge]
We had our moments, didn't we? (Oh)
So much that we will never be (Oh)
[Chorus]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we fly?
Know that I, know that I still care for you
But didn't we, didn't we say goodbye?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we try? (Didn't we try?)
Know that I, know that I still care for you (For you)
Tell me why good things have to die (To die)9Embed Didn't I Didn't I OneRepublic piano
