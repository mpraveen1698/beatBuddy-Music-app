[Chorus]
Riders on the storm, riders on the storm
Into this house we're born, into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone, an actor out on loan
Riders on the storm

[Verse 1]
There's a killer on the road, his brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday, let your children play
If you give this man a ride, sweet family will die
Killer on the road, yeah

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Girl, you gotta love your man, girl, you gotta love your man
Take him by the hand, make him understand
The world on you depends, our life will never end
Gotta love your man, yeah

Riders on the storm, riders on the storm
