It's the end of the month and the weekend
I'ma spend this check, everything on me, yeah
I'ma tip myself, I'ma spend it on myself
I'ma drop it like it's pourin', I'ma pour it on myself

[Refrain]
Che-che-che-check that money-makin' bank account number (Yikes)
That's that shit that's never gettin' bounced on ya
Bitch, I do the money dance, I just made a hundred bands
When the store says, "Sign for it," I'ma leave my autograph

[Pre-Chorus]
Dolla' bills, dolla' bills
Watch it fallin' for me, I love the way that feels
Dolla' bills, dolla' bills
Keep on fallin' for me, I love thе way it feels

[Chorus]
I came here to drop somе money, droppin' all my money
Drop some money, all this bread so yummy, yeah
Twerkin', twerkin' when I buy the things I like
Dolla', dollas droppin' on my ass tonight

[Verse 2]
Everyone silent, listen to my money talk
Spend how I like it, yeah, everyone know what I mean, mean
When they see green, when they see green, that mean go
Give me what the hell I want, give me what the hell I want
