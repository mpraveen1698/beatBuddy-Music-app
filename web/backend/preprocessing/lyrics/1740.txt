Do you remember happy together?
I do, don't you?
Then all of a sudden, you're sick to your stomach
Is that still true?

[Chorus]
You said, "forever," in the end I fought it
Please be honest, are we better for it?
Thought you'd hate me, but instead you called
And said, "I miss you"
I caught it

[Verse 2]
Good to each other, give it the summer
I knew, you too
But I only saw you once in December
I'm still confused

[Chorus]
You said, "forever," and I almost bought it
I miss fighting in your old apartment
Breaking dishes when you're disappointed
I still love you, I promise
Nothing happened in the way I wanted
Every corner of this house is haunted
And I know you said that we're not talking
But I miss you, I'm sorry

I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us
I don't wanna go, we've been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you (You said, "forever," and I almost bought it)
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse (I miss fighting in your old apartment)
Everything I know brings me back to us (Breaking dishes when you're disappointed)
I don't wanna go, we've been here before (I still love you, I promise)
Everywhere I go leads me back to you (Nothing happened in the way I wanted)
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse (Every corner of this house is haunted)
Everything I know brings me back to us (And I know you said that we're not talking)
I don't wanna go, we've been here before (But I miss you)
Everywhere I go leads me back to you
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us
I don't wanna go, we've been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you29Embed I miss you, I’m sorry minor Gracie Abrams indie-pop
