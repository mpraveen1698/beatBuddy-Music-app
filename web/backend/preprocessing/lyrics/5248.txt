Mm, yeah

[Verse 1: Sorana]
Mirrors, they never lie
Don't see myself inside
Why can't I get it right?
I don't know
You're always watching me fall
Shadows, they like my wall
Why do I feel so small?
I don't know

[Pre-Chorus: Sorana]
So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know

[Chorus: Sorana]
I lost, I lost, I lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame, I lost control again
I don't, I don't, I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame, I lost control again

[Drop: Sorana]
Ooh
You might also like[Verse 2: Sorana]
Tired of being afraid
But lately, I lost my faith
What is love without pain?
It ain't home
You're watching me, but I'm below
When I get caught, I hope
This is kind of like how they will
Take me home

[Pre-Chorus: Sorana]
So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know

[Chorus: Sorana]
I lost, I lost, I lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame, I lost control again
I don't, I don't, I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame, I lost control again

[Drop]

[Bridge: Sorana]
I know that I'm a mess
But I ain't trying to be the best
Oh, whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay
Never said I was an angel
I am damaged all the way
So whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay
[Chorus: Sorana]
I lost, I lost, I lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame, I lost control again
I don't, I don't, I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame, I lost control again
