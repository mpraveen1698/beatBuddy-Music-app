16 ContributorsChanging Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hell down, heaven now
Livin' in the same town
Tryna find something new
Broken picture frame I've been frozen in
Tryna find a better view

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't me, this ain't cool
This ain't what I signed up to
This ain't right, it's no good
No good, oh

[Chorus]
Everything is changing
And I've been here for too long
Going through the same things
I've been hurting too long, got to move on
Say I-I-I-I
I can't do this anymore
If everything is changing
Then I know, yeah
Gotta let go
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh
Gotta let go
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Gotta let go

I don't understand playing by the same hand
How you find something new
I can't work it out, what it's all about
I won't live my life through you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't you, this ain't true
This ain't what I signed up to
This ain't right, it's no good
No good, oh

[Chorus]
Everything is changing
And I've been here for too long
Going through the same things
I've been hurting too long, got to move on
Say I-I-I-I
I can't do this anymore
If everything is changing
Then I know, yeah
Gotta let go
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Gotta to let go
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Gotta to let go
[Outro]
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
