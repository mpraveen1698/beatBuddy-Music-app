Can you hear the silence? Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken? Can you feel my heart?

[Verse 1: Jeris Johnson]
I been terrorized by a thousand ghosts
But my cry for help's stuck up in my throat
And the highest I'll get is the lowest I'll know
'Cause I'm falling and falling
Dripping and ripping asunder, bury me deep in a slumber
Clouds on my head like a bummer, drown out my demons with thunder
Put up a wall with no lumber, facedown deep in a ditch, I'm in a pit
Running in circles so fast, someone, pull me outta this shit

[Chorus: Jeris Johnson & Oli Sykes]
Can you hear the silence? Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken? Can you heal a scar?
And has anybody noticed my bloody sweater arm?
Scrеaming, "Can you feel my heart?"
Holding on, bring me close, feel my hеart
Can you feel my heart?

[Verse 2: Oli Skyes]
Can you help the hopeless? Well, I'm begging on my knees (Begging on my knees)
Can you save my bastard soul? Will you wait for me?
I'm sorry, brothers, so sorry, lover
Forgive me, father, I love you, mother
Can you hear the silence? Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken? Can you feel my heart?

Can you hear the silence? Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken? Can you heal a scar?
And has anybody noticed my bloody sweater arm?
Can you feel my heart?
Holding on, bring me close, feel my heart
Can you feel my heart?

[Bridge: Oli Skyes]
I'm scared to get close, and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim
I'm scared to get close, and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

[Chorus: Jeris Johnson & Oli Sykes]
Can you feel my heart?
Can you hear the silence? Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken? Can you heal a scar?
And has anybody noticed my bloody sweater arm?
Can you feel my heart?
Holding on, bring me close, feel my heart
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?5Embed Can You Feel My Heart - Remix Can You Feel My Heart (Remix) Bring Me The Horizon;Jeris Johnson metal
