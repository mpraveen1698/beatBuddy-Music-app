I count the falling tears
They fall before my eyes
Seems like a thousand years
Since we broke the ties
I call you on the phone
But never get a rise
So, sit there all alone
It's time you realize

[Chorus]
I'm not your fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
I'm no fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
Never again, no! No!

[Verse 2]
You take your road I'll take mine
The paths have both been beaten
Searchin' for a change of pace
Life needs to be sweetened
I scream my heart out
Just to make a dime
And with that dime I bought your love
But, now, I've changed my mind
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm not your fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
I'm no fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
Never again, no! No!
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
I'm no fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)

[Bridge]
I count the falling tears
They fall before my eyes
Seems like a thousand years
Since we broke the ties, oh! Oh! Oh!

[Outro]
I'm not your fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
I'm no fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
I'm no fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
I'm no fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
No! Oh! Oh! Oh!
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
No, I'm not your fool
(Nobody's fool)
