21 ContributorsMemory Lyrics[Intro: blackbear & Kane Brown]
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ayy, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah

[Chorus: Kane Brown & blackbear]
I wanna live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
I wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory

[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
Am I the only one that's comin' unglued?
Emotions building up, they start to run you
The bottles on the shelf I'm 'bout to run through
Doin' everything I wish that I can undo, ayy
I'm by myself
And why won't no one help?
I know this can't be healthy
So I'm lookin' for a way out (For a way out)

[Chorus: Kane Brown & blackbear]
I wanna live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
I wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory
Live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
I wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And I don't wanna be a memory
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Talk to me blackbear

[Verse 2:  blackbear]
Tryna find the beauty in the letdown
Goin' through my text now
Tryna find the things I never said to prove a point
I'ma roll my feelings in a joint
Pieces of the story that got left out, I checked out
Wish it was, I wish it was, I wish it was a phase
Nothin' you could do and there's nothin' you could say
Runnin' from the, runnin' from the, runnin' from the pain
I gotta get away, ayy-ayy (I gotta get away, ayy-ayy, I gotta get away, ayy-ayy, I gotta get away, ayy-ayy)

[Chorus: Kane Brown & blackbear]
I wanna live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
I wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory
Live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
I wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory
[Outro: Kane Brown & blackbear]
Am I the only one that's comin' unglued?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And I don't wanna be a memory
The bottles on the shelf I'm 'bout to run through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And I don't wanna be a memory
I'm by myself
And why won't no one help?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And I don't wanna be a memory
I know this can't be healthy
So I'm lookin' for a way out (For a way out)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And I don't wanna be a memory1Embed Memory Memory Kane Brown;blackbear country
