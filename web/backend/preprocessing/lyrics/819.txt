59 ContributorsHomage Lyrics[Verse]
Someone wrote this song before
And I could tell you where it's from
The 4736251 to put my mind at ease

[Chorus]
Please just have a laugh with me
'Cause you know I'm borrowing by now
These sounds, have already crowned
Come on it's a silly dream
Dreaming of the imagery unfound
The view sits nice from that cloud

[Post-Chorus]
And if you want a piece of my thoughts
There's a coin worth flipping
Why don't you toss?
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Please just have a laugh with me
'Cause you know I'm borrowing by now
These sounds, have already crowned
Come on it's a silly dream
Dreaming of the imagery unfound
The view sits nice from that cloud
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
And if you want a piece of my thoughts
There's a coin worth flipping
Why don't you toss?26Embed Homage Skiptracing Mild High Club rock
