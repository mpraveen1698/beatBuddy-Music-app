7 ContributorsPortland, Maine Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't want to be talking on the phone every night
6 PM, which timezone, yours or mine?
Ain't gonna worry where you are, who you're with
Let's just agree, this is it

[Chorus]
Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend that I won't miss this
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't want to know, I don't want to know

[Verse 2]
See, I'm just saving us some trouble somewhere down the line
This kind of town you just leave behind
And you don't know it yet, but you won't come back
And I ain't going nowhere and you know that

[Chorus]
Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend that I won't miss this
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
You might also like[Bridge]
And you can go ahead and hate me, that's just fine
It doesn't matter either way, I'm right

[Chorus]
Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, that I won't miss this
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is

[Outro]
And I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know1Embed Portland, Maine Hard Settle, Ain't Troubled Donovan Woods acoustic
