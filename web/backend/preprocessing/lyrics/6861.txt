17 ContributorsForest Fires Lyrics[Verse 1]
I painted you a picture
Picture full of light
It includes a heavy memory
Memory so bright

[Pre-Chorus]
I can’t change your thoughts, my dear
I can’t change your fears
But if you want I'll travel near
To make it disappear

[Chorus]
I’ll be there in the summer
‘Cause your heart isn’t safe
You won’t go, you're not a runner
So you won’t run away
If you could follow your heart gently
There wouldn’t be this mess
Maybe someday, just someday you’ll find a way back

[Verse 2]
Your dreams are incredibly loud tonight
You’re creating forest fires
You can’t even change your sight
It's stuck in you like a virus
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I can’t change your thoughts, my dear
I can’t change your fears
But if you want I'll travel near
To make it disappear

[Chorus]
I’ll be there in the summer
‘Cause your heart isn’t safe
You won’t go, you're not a runner
So you won’t run away
If you could follow your heart gently
There wouldn’t be this mess
Maybe someday, just someday you’ll find a way back8Embed Forest Fires Forest Fires Axel Flóvent folk
