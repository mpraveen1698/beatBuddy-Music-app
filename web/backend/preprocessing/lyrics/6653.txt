[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
(A$AP Rocky)
Mister Frankenstein
Or Victor Frankenstein (Ooh)
I'm Doctor Frankenstein
I'm out here saving lives
Igor by my side (Ooh)
That's right, I made you, slime (Ooh)
Tyler create you guys
Never mind, "It's alive!" (Uh)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I bet you hate that line (Woo)
That's death to everybody in my class, no Columbine (Woo)
Pay me in decimals (Uh), comma signs, dollar signs
Baby, pay me no mind 'cause I'm outta mine (A$AP Rocky)
This nigga's outta line (Uh)
Iced out pendant, Jesus
Iced out cross, missed out on church last weekend
Ice to his chin, now them charges pending
Know that I'ma sin, Lord, forgive us (Woo)
I'ma go to church next Christmas
I remember that-that Thank-Thanksgiving
When we was eating Church's Chicken, now ain't that somethin'
It made me who I am, I don't take back shit (Bitch)

So ungrateful
Remember who raised you
Don't bite the hand that feed you
Be the same hand that pays you (Woo)
So ungrateful
I'ma make these boys act thankful
Like they forget that they need you
Most of these hoes unfaithful
So ungrateful (A$AP Rocky)
I'm the one who raised you
Bite the hand that feeds you
Be the hand that pay you, bitch
So unfaithful
I'mma make these boys act thankful
It's like they forget that they need you
Most of these hoes unfaithful (Uh, yeah)
So ungrateful, boy you forget who raised you
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Most of these hoes unfaithful (What's going on?)

[Part II]

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Where the fuck you been? Where the fuck you been?
Came to fuck up shit in the club again
Where the fuck you been? Where the fuck you been?
Shut the fuck up, nigga, way too talkative
[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
I'm in the mosh pit, finna bust some shit
I'm in the mosh pit, finna bust some shit
In the mosh pit, I'm finna fuck up shit
Bloody nose, busted lip, boy, I love this shit (Yeah)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Poof, got my boots, got it laced, fuck up out my face
Who, lost? Got it, force, I'ma floss, Norway, Voss (Woo)
Yeah, that's water, boy, call me the waterboy
Like Bobby Boucher, tax spray
Like what my ma-ma-ma-mama say
Flow, 'lil boy, you'd better call the law
They got a styrofoam cup, well, where your soda, boy?
Now I'm in my bag, can't forget my past
Focus on my path, they gon' feel my wrath
Please don't touch my, please don't touch my
Kiss my ass, then collect my thoughts
Then collect my gat, oh, where the guns?
What I’m forced to resort to, fuck you expect?

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
I'm in the mosh pit, finna bust some shit
I'm in the mosh pit, finna bust some shit
In the mosh pit, I'm finna fuck up shit
Bloody nose, busted lip, boy, I love this shit (Bitch)
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Where the fuck you been? Where the fuck you been?
Came to fuck up shit in the club again
Where the fuck you been? Where the fuck you been?
Shut the fuck up, nigga, way too talkative
Where the fuck you been? Where the fuck you been?
Turn the fuck up, nigga, in the club again
Where the fuck you been? Where the fuck you been?
