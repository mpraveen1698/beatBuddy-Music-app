2 ContributorsOther Half LyricsStayed up
Wide awake like usual, just thinking
What it’s like to have someone that stays by
Oh by your side no matter what you do

Tried to
I tried to find somebody new that I could
Share all of my stupid thoughts but no one
No one seems that interested enough

Until I met this girl one day
And we both spent our time till late
She made my heart beat with her smile
Oh I
Oh I

I wanna make you mine
Promise that we would last
No I’m not here to tell you lies
I’m just here cause I’m in love

With you, that’s right
No I can’t get enough
I’ve been searching for a while
But now I’ve found my other half

Yea we, we understood both our needs
Oh we (Yeah), compliment each other’s missing piece

Oh I’m so glad I met you babe
We'd talk on the phone till 4 a.m
Hearing your voice just makes me smile
Oh I
Oh I

I wanna make you mine
Promise that we would last
No I’m not here to tell you lies
I’m just here cause I’m in love

With you, that’s right
No I can’t get enough
I’ve been searching for a while
But now I’ve found my other half

I wanna make you proud
Show you I’m worth your time
And I’ll take care of your heart
You don’t have to worry bout

Anything, cause we’ve got everything
I’ve been searching for a while
But now I’ve found my other half (Yeah)
You make me feel like I’m alive
My medicine for when I’m down
You make me feel like I’m alive
My medicine for when I’m down4Embed Other Half Other Half Rangga Jones chill
