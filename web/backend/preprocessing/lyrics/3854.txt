What you gon' do with—
What you gon' do with—
What you gon' do with all that junk?
(Junk)

[Pre-Drop: Fergie & will.i.am]
What you gon' do with all that junk
All that junk inside your trunk?
I'ma get-get-get-get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump
My hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump
My lovely little lumps, check it out!
I drive these brothers crazy, I do it on the daily

[Drop: Fergie]
They treat me really nicely, they buy me all these iceys
Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi and then Donna
Karan, they be sharing all their money
Got me wearin' fly gear but I ain't asking
They say they love my ass in Seven Jeans, True Religion
I say "No," but they keep giving
So I keep on taking, and no, I ain't taken
We can keep on dating, I keep on demonstrating my love
My love, my love, my love
You love my lady lumps
My hump, my hump, my hump
My humps they got you
My humps they got you (Love—)
You might also like[Build: Fergie & will.i.am]
My humps they got you (Love—)
Spending all your money on me
Spending all your money on me (Ah, on me, on me)
Ah, on me, on me
Ah, on me, on me
What you gon' do with all that junk
All that junk inside your trunk?
I'ma get-get-get-get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump
What you gonna do with all that ass
All that ass inside 'em jeans?
I'ma make-make-make-make you scream
My hump, my hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump
My lovely lady lumps
Check it out

[Drop: Fergie]
My hump, my hump, my hump

[Outro: Fergie & will.i.am]
You can look but you can't touch, if you touch it, touch it
Touch it
Touch it
