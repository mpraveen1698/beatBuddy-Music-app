1 Contributor3rd song.. wld also b LastTrack? LyricsIts supposed to b just as big of prod?
- it's supposed to b dropC/fullC contrasts (mymymy-bloom,papercuts-ay,sidebyside,flames,gorgeous,doneforme,iwarned-mother)
& the only way to do tht in popunk is either ballad? & since ur not a feature lik (flames), take away the feature and ur left w just a ballad*.  fuck its a acoustic ballad. (+9live-morethnlife-lastnovembr) - still all bout the same theme
(+hazelinside) the last track's? lik how (bldyval.acous,maybe.acous,cantimagine) r last tracks
U cn use 'star..everyone I/u loved' as metaphor fr the ballad -also in (lastnvmbr.brdg, lookupatstars)

"all the stars look the same" ?
**it's an acoustic-song
The same guitar chords strum pattern; bright high freq.s vocs & guitar; use condenser mic for guitar & mix in w low end from DI?  *low quality voicenote-lik raw unedited live one-take*   feels the most personal too

🌠hv album cover b a page of raw lyrics of the song? lik a memoir/bible style*
Short lyr.sections 1V1C1V1C..
Mm.. shld u hv a lik 4 / 10 min song notebook diary journal as last track lik (alltoowell,deolationrow,venicebitch.. |twinflame/bornhorn, imlostwthtu, rapgod/stan, jesusofsuburdia,bandito,cruelwrld)?
Shld 1stV b lik (ithikok, ay) kinda?
-- but they're lyr.s r all simple love songs
Ur lyr.s r most lik (intro.shawn*,internetkillrckstr,bandito,dropsjupiter?,milliondreams | lastnovmbr)

So... not raw then..
And intro track wld b not a ballad.. but lik (pinkvenm, ..)
& outrotrakck (ithinkok,playthisgone,twinflame,intrntrckstr,tellmetmrw..)
Nono stop. still want tht raw outro track
..
Track2 & LastTrack r Opp.s - (deadinside-hazelinsid,wonder-cantimagine,godsvme-twinflame)
- wldnt ripnvrsy mk sns as the lasttrack then** lik (lastdayalive,boyblackdress?,ithinkok?famouslastwords?)

So no 3rd song wldnt b a ballad then..
It wld b the opp.colors lik (dontfeelsadtoday |ww3,pills,etc?) ohmy so the song wld b cult rock for losers?  secret society of losers
Just ignore the dropC thing cause its kinda in ur 2ndsong? yea ignore it lik yungblud
Or lik (mainstrm,lovesux) title song in mid of album
Or opp.s colors 'Emo World'? (+lik cncrtaliens,brokenwrld,emogrl,twinklebitch)

Cover b lik a printed old school lady screaming horror movie poster pinned on the side of an empty street at night, w silhouette of a clown in the middle of the street OR just a movie poster styled cover lik concertforaliens
OR
Emo World.. no hs to b cliche too**


Tale of.. / folklore.. / bible.. / Romania / March /
How bout the album title b the name of a year lik 19thcentury BCE / Mesozoic Era / 66 BC / AD 1 / EST? / Year 0 / 19XX / 1990
-lik 19 something..  (1989,1975,LastDayOfSummer)
- lik almost lik a history study vibe
W a 'location' 1sttrack?
'2003'albumtitle- 1strack 'church of..'

Or lik (mainstrm,hoteldiablo,lifeofpablo)
Look at 1st 2 tracks.. 'born..' -> '2 lovers/character'
'mainstream religion'?
'scientology: the study of human ..' ?
Post-_ Era / Circa.. / pre-requisite era
'Life of..[Hysteria/Heidí/Mydia/Jesus name parody]' 'Age/Dawn Of Revolution/revolt'
So marchthe3rd album titles r eras? prehistoric>big bang/modern>aliens>futuristic ?

So lik instead of 'life of.. [name]' , it's 'cult of.. [name]'
Cool fictitious name lik 'Snow White'  2 syll.s   OR   lik a 'gang/group name'?
-cuz the tracklist still follows the story of 1 character's life(?)
Cult of Stoichvsky' / Stoichvouism' ? / cult of stoivchouism / cult of diablo / Cult of D'Vouis / D'Vouidsm / cult of gotham / Cult of D'Vous
/ Cult of Saint D'Vous / Cult Of Gothia  / Cult Gothia / Cult of Goth(i)ana
// or cult of mainstream/sellout/losers? / ⚔️ Cult of Gothana 🛡 / Cult of Gothena
I think ur going for lik (hopeforyouth,internetkillrckstr,richkidsruin,blackparade)
Church of emo world / gotham /  [bad place] LA /
Yea no I dont think u shld b limited to just 'church', since emoworld is in the tracklist.. it shld b lik, more expansive so its not just a church & religion, its the world & religion?, lik 'tickets to my downfall'/highway to hell' title? '_ to church' - or 'life of..' ??  /  'church of heidall/narnia / bell / broken _
Emo world -> pet gurl
Wonder world -> emo world
