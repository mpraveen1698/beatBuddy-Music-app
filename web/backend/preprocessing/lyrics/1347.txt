(D-D-Dark side)

[Verse 1: Tomine Harket]
We're not in love
We share no stories
Just somethin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind

[Chorus: Tomine Harket]
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it, let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side

[Post-Chorus: Tomine Harket]
Fall into the dark side
Give in to the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side

Beneath the sky
As black as diamonds
We're runnin' out of time (Time, time)
Don't wait for truth
To come and blind us
Let's just believe their lies

[Pre-Chorus: Au/Ra]
Believe it, I see it
I know that you can feel it
No secrets worth keepin'
So fool me like I'm dreamin'

[Chorus: Tomine Harket & Au/Ra]
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it, let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side

[Post-Chorus: Tomine Harket & Au/Ra]
Fall into the dark side
Give in to the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side
