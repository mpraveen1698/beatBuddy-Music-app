9 ContributorsTell Me Why Iâ€™m Waiting Freestyle Lyrics[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty & Juice WRLD]
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Like I don't wanna talk about it, yeah, well look
No, no, you wouldn't...
Taylor 'bout to fuckin' flex

[Verse]
I was in the cut with a AK
Caught a nigga lackin' on the same day
Run up in his trap, that's a vacay
Turned his mom house to a danger place
God damn, on my danger zone
Fuck your bitch, that's why I'm on my own
President, feel like Obama on
K's and shit, that's that Osama, woah, ayy
Ayy, they wonder why I rap like this
I'm off the xans, and the Hen', and the gin, damn
They wonder why I act like this, yeah
Why I talk my crap like this, yeah
Why I tote my strap like this, yeah
I feel like Santa in Christmas time
Three hoes in my lap, like, shit, yeah
Huh, ayy, They call me the radio
I fuck yo' bitch, that's yo' wifey? Well, I call her a crazy ho
I got a black bitch, a white bitch, a black bitch, I call that a Oreo
I see the future like a fortune teller, they call me a oracle, huh
I feel like Jesus, call out to Jesus, fuck her like miraclesYou might also like7Embed Tell Me Why I'm Waiting Tell Me Why I'm Waiting creamy chill
