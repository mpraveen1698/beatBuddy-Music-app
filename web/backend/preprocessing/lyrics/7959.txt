2 Contributors18 Lyrics[Intro]
Can we go back to eighteen?
When all that we had was daydreams
When you were my everythin'
We were falling for each other
Remember in the summer

[Verse 1]
Driving around, you're not around these days
Same paper town feels different now and I hate
Seein' you in every face
It's a memory that I can't shake
Where are you now and did you get out this place?

[Chorus]
Can we go back to eighteen?
When all that we had was daydrеams
When you were my еverythin'
We were falling for each other
Remember in the summer of 2013
Kissing in your backseat
Listening to the A-Team
I should've loved you better
But nothing lasts forever

[Verse 2]
Driving around, the city is loud these days
This Hollywood town is bringin' me down
And I've changed
And you can see it on my face
It's a feeling that I just can't shake
Yeah, I don't know how, I gotta get out this place

Can we go back to eighteen?
When all that we had was daydreams

Kissing in your backseat

I should've loved you better

Oh, it's just a dream I know
It's just a dream I know
It's a dream
