1 ContributorRapturous Euphoria LyricsI scorn all virgin and tattered flesh
Disgusting victims of their own lies
I have belayed my deepest affection
With utmost vengeance i seek the end of
Breath giving life

Overwhelmed with no self control
I hunt and wait to strike

In my domain I dwell, I am master
Misplaced in hell for the sake of reaching heaven
Savoring this state of nostalgia
Which cannot
Will not
Does not exist

Cold flesh
Pale elegant and emaciated
Never adequate for life

Lust of your death
Enthralled by the taste of hypnotic tragedy
Here I dream lucid of the quietus of you
And all that you hold dear

Cleansed of my conscience
While spilling the blood within you
Anxiously awaiting the rapturous euphoria
I shall endure
You might also likeThere will never be forgiveness within my dominion
Misplaced in hell for the sake of reaching heaven
Savoring this state of nostalgia
Which cannot
Will not
Does not exist

Lust of your death
Enthralled by the taste of hypnotic tragedy
Here I dream lucid of the quietus of you
And all that you hold so dear

Cleansed of my conscience
While spilling the blood within you
Anxiously awaiting the rapturous euphoria
I shall endureEmbed Nostalgia Nostalgia Will Carano sleep
