25 ContributorsHeartbeats Lyrics[Verse 1]
One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away
Both under influence
We had divine sense
To know what to say
Mind is a razor blade

[Chorus]
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

[Verse 2]
One night of magic rush
The start a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief
Ten days of perfect hues
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love

[Chorus]
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough

And you, you knew the hand of the devil
And you, kept us awake with wolf teeth
Sharing different heartbeats
In one night

[Chorus]
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough11Embed Heartbeats Veneer José González singer-songwriter
