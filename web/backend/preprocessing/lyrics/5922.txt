People say I try too hard
People say I come off really awkward
You know I don't mean no harm 
I'm just trying to be myself, but

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I get confused
'Cause I can't read social cues
Threw my inhibitions out the door
I don't have an excuse
I'm just living in my youth
Don't know why people don't like me more

[Chorus]
I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends but I'll be fine
I don't need them to pass the time
And when I put my resting bitch face on I look stone cold
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends

I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends

[Verse 2]
You'll never know what's on my mind (my mind)
You'll never know the secrets that I'm keeping
I'll scare you off with my crazy eyes (my eyes)
'Cause all I need is me myself and

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't got no shame
'Cause my life is just a game
And I don’t care who's been keeping score (oh, no)
Everybody thinks I'm strange
It's just something in my brain
Don't know who they're being normal for

[Chorus]
I have no friends but that’s okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends and that's a sign
I don't need them to pass the time
And when I put my resting bitch face on I look stone cold
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends
[Drop]
No friends
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends

[Bridge]
I don't need anybody's hand to hold at night
As long as I'm with me I know I'll be alright
'Cause I can't love no one else
Spent my love on just myself
Took this people-pleaser heart
And I tore it all apart
Now I'm finally set free
I'm so proud to be me
That's why I don't care I just wanna say
I have no
La la la la la

[Drop]
No friends
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends
[Outro]
No friends
No friends
I'd rather be alone
No friends
All I need is me myself-
No friends
I have no friends5Embed No Friends No Friends Cadmium;Rosendale edm
