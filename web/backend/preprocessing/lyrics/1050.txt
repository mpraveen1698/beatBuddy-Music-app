The day after you said, "Goodbye"
All I did was lay in bed and cry
But after one month, I started to move on
And after two, I felt alright
Then three months in, you were off my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And month four and five, I was living my life
I was better and didn't have to try
Not to think of you, until you reached out and said
"Remember that night?"

[Chorus]
We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning
I kissed you, it was pouring
We held each other tight
Before the night was over
You looked over your shoulder
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, "Remember that night? Remember that night?"
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, "Remember that night? Remember that night?"

[Verse 2]
The day after you had reached out
I was broken for the second time around
I prayed on the third day that I would be okay
That I'd forget you were ever mine
Oh, I don't think you realize
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
How long I had to fight to be living my life
To get better and never have to try
Not to think of you, until you reached out and said
"Remember that night?"

[Chorus]
We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning
I kissed you, it was pouring
We held each other tight
Before the night was over
You looked over your shoulder
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, "Remember that night? Remember that night?"
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, "Remember that night? Remember that night?"

[Bridge]
Do you remember?
Remember?

[Chorus]
We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning
I kissed you, it was pouring
We held each other tight
Before the night was over
You looked over your shoulder
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, "Remember that night? Remember that night?"
Oh, I was doing fine
You said, "Remember that night? Remember that night?"
[Outro]
Do you remember?
