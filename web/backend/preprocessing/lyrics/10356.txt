24 ContributorsSoft LyricsYou're mine, motherfucker

Let me begin with envyâ€™s a sin
You'll have to find new words to invent
'Cause I've heard your broken record
And I'm not impressed

I love when you talk, I just use it to drive me
I won't let your judgment define me
I'm not broken, so don't fix me
I want you to hate me

Tell me what you've lost
Hang me on your cross
If you're so wise, then why are you so soft?
Do you leave your "throne" as you cast your stones?
I'm above living under your microscope

You're mine, motherfucker

I'm insane, I'm "insane in the membrane"
I wanna fuck your face with a switchblade
I'm not broken, so don't fix me
I'll leave you behind me

If you're so wise, then why are you so soft?
Do you leave your "throne" as you cast your stones?
I'm above living under your microscope

Cry baby, cry baby
Did I just hear you whimper?
Cry baby, cry
Suck my middle fucking finger

Cry baby, cry baby
What have you done lately?
Cry baby, cry baby
What have you done?

Tell me what you've lost
Demonize my flaws
Do they call you when dumb needs a mascot?
Do you leave your "throne" as you cast your stones?
I'm above living under your microscope

You dilate, God of your existence
Begging me to listen while you "pray"
Swallow in vain, silver spoon religion
Closer from a distance
You're mine, motherfucker5Embed Soft Graveyard Shift Motionless In White metalcore
