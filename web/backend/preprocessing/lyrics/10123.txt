The drugs begin to peak
A smile of joy arrives in me
But sedation changes to panic and nausea
And breath starts to shorten and heartbeats pound softer

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't try to save me
You just want to hurt me, and leave me desperate

[Chorus]
You taught my heart a sense I never knew I had
I can forget the times that I was
Lost and depressed from the awful truth, how do you do it?
You're my heroine

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't leave me alone
Chisel my heart out of stone, I give in every time

[Chorus]
You taught my heart a sense I never knew I had
I can forget the times that I was
Lost and depressed from the awful truth, how do you do it?
You're my heroine

I bet you laugh at the thought of me thinking for myself
I bet you believe that I'm better off with you than someone else

[Verse 2]
Your face arrives again
A hope I had becomes surreal
But under your cover's more torture than pleasure
And just past your lips there's more anger than laughter
Not now or forever will I ever change you
I know that to go on, I'll break you, my habit

[Chorus]
You taught my heart a sense I never knew I had
I can forget the times that I was
Lost and depressed from the awful truth, how do you do it?
You're my heroine

[Outro]
I will save myself!5Embed My Heroine Discovering The Waterfront Silverstein metalcore
