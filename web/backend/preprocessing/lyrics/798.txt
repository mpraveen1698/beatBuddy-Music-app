I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
We were sitting down in a restaurant, waiting for the check
We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
But I could tell that something had changed, how you looked at me then

[Chorus]
Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you
To slip back in bed
When you light the candle

[Verse 2]
And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now
And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
Think I like you best when you're just with me and no one else

[Chorus]
Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you
To slip back in bed
When you light the candle

[Verse 3]
And I'm kissing you, lying in my room
Holding you until you fall asleep
And it's just as good as I knew it would be
Stay with me, I don't want you to leave
