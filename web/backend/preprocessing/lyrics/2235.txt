83 ContributorsTime to Pretend Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm feelin' rough, I'm feelin' raw
I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

[Chorus]
Forget about our mothers and our friends
We're fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

[Verse 2]
I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and diggin' up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course

[Chorus]
We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We were fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

[Outro]
I said yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah53Embed Time to Pretend Oracular Spectacular MGMT alt-rock
