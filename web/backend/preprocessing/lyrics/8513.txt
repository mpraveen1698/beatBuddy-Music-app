16 ContributorsWe Are Lyrics[Intro]
We are, we are
We are, we are

[Verse 1]
They think that we're no one
We're nothing, not sorry
They push us
It’s too late, it’s too late
Not going back

[Verse 2]
They think we are made up
Of all of our failures
They think we are foolish
And that’s how the story goes

[Pre-Chorus]
They stand for nothing
They’re lifeless and cold
Anything they say
Will never break our hearts of gold

[Chorus]
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Not here to hold you
‘Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark

Now covered in madness
But they just can’t hurt us
They tell us we're nothing
Keep walking and let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
They are the weakest
And don’t even know
Anything they say
Will never break our hearts of gold

[Chorus]
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Not here to hold you
‘Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark

[Bridge]
Never tell yourself
You should be someone else
Stand up tall and say
I’m not afraid, I’m not afraid
So never tell yourself
You should be someone else
Stand up tall and say
I’m not afraid
[Chorus]
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Not here to hold you
‘Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark3Embed We Are Ambitions ONE OK ROCK j-pop
