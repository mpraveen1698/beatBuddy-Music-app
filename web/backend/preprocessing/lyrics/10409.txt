6 ContributorsNikeys Pt. 2 in Mint Lyrics[Chorus]
I was daydreamin' 'bout you again
In the sunflower fields with my friends
Got a stain from the grass on my Nikes
Want a mint green red sunset instead
I was daydreamin' 'bout you again
In the sunflower fields with my friends
Got a stain from the grass on my Nikes
Want a mint green red sunset instead

[Verse 1]
Blue skies, but it's cold
Grass stains on my soles
Puffer coat that I sold
Don't need any clothes
Cigarette that he rolled
Two fingers to hold
I was on your old MySpace
Think that's how it goes

[Verse 2]
Heard you tweakin' 'bout words and feelings
And it hurts to see you're in deep
Found a building, but need a filming
So I FaceTimed Phelan last week (Yo, you're up, right?)
Nike socks on my feet
Model X on my seat
Camеra cut 'cause we've got еnough
And I'm standin' up while he seated
You might also like[Chorus]
I was daydreamin' 'bout you again
In the sunflower fields with my friends
Got a stain from the grass on my Nikes
Want a mint green red sunset instead
I was daydreamin' 'bout you again
In the sunflower fields with my friends
Got a stain from the grass on my Nikes
Want a mint green red sunset instead

[Outro]
I was daydreaming, I was daydreaming, I was daydreaming
With the sunflowers, the sunflowers, the sunflowers
Grass on my Nikes, my Nikes, my Nikes
In the sunset, in the sunset, in the sunset
I was daydreaming, I was daydreaming, I was daydreaming
With the sunflowers, the sunflowers, the sunflowers
Grass on my Nikes, my Nikes, my Nikes
In the sunset, in the sunset, in the sunsetEmbed NIKEYS PT. 2 IN MINT NIKEYS PT. 2 IN MINT Yxngxr1 sad
