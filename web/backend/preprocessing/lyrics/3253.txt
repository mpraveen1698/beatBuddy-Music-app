25 ContributorsThe Dress Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you still take a long time to get ready?
'Cause you used to make too much out of that kind of stuff
When you turn your head around and it kills
'Cause the dress looks nice on you still
And it always will
I wait a long time just to see you
I'm happy to be catchin' up
No, we don't have to patch things up
Just turn the lights down for the thrill
'Cause the dress looks nice on you still
And it always will, so

[Chorus]
We should go out and dance like we used to dance
We should go out and hold hands like lovers hold hands
And I can't tell you who's gonna last
Well maybe that's the question, an answer I don't have
(I can't tell)

[Verse 2]
Okay, I took a long time to get ready too
'Cause I didn't remember it
And my head got heavy like it tends to do
And I know that ain't part of the deal
But the dress looks nice on you still
And it always will
I hated myself for some time
For the things that I said
The things that I put in your head
And I tried and I tried, but I failed
But the dress looks nice on you still
And it always will, so
You might also like[Chorus]
We should go out and dance like we used to dance
We should go out and hold hands like lovers hold hands
And I can't tell you who's gonna last
Well maybe that's the question, an answer I don't have
Well maybe that's the question, an answer I don't have
We should go out and dance like we used to dance
We should go out and hold hands like lovers hold hands
And I can't tell you who's gonna last
Well maybe that's the question, an answer I don't have
Well maybe that's the question, an answer I don't have

[Outro]
(We should go out
Said we should go out)2Embed The Dress Absolutely Dijon soul
