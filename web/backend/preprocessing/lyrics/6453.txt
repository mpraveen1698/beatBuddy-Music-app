Illusion, illusion
Illusion, illusion

[Verse 1]
Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place another time
Touching many hearts along the way, yeah
Hoping that I'll never have to say
It's just an illusion

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah) Illusion

Follow your emotions anywhere
Is it really magic in the air?
Never let your feelings get you down
Open up your eyes and look around
It's just an illusion
