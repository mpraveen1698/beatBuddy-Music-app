1 ContributorPink Cheeks LyricsLet's leave it with me, just step by step
Sorry that I'm quick of foot, I'll walk your step
I'm wondering now, where is your wings?
Tremble lips and blurry eyes and your pink cheeks

Let's leave it with me, just step by step
Sorry that I'm quick of foot, I'll walk your step
I'm wondering now, where is your wings?
Tremble lips and blurry eyes and your pink cheeks

And we should make the plan, then actual date and time, will you?
You never say for sure, I wanna know how you think and feel
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, that I wanna say is

People might be watching, that is what I'm wanting
네게 보이는 halo, maybe I am weirdo
All my friеnds are talkin', but I don't give a shit
눈에 보이는 halo, maybe I'm thе weirdo

Let's leave it with me, just step by step
Sorry that I'm quick of foot, I'll walk your step
I'm wondering now, where is your wings?
Tremble lips and blurry eyes and your pink cheeks

And we should make the plan, then actual date and time, will you?
You never say for sure, I wanna know how you think and feel
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, that I wanna say is
You might also likePeople might be watching, that is what I'm wanting
네게 보이는 halo, maybe I am weirdo
All my friends are talkin', but I don't give a shit
눈에 보이는 halo, maybe I'm the weirdo

Say that you're the one I need, I loved you since I kissed your cheeks
Say that you're the one I need, I loved you since I kissed your cheeksEmbed Pink cheeks Pink cheeks Eldon chill
