Shriek the lips across ragged tongue
Convulsing together, sing violently
Move the jaw, cry aloud
Bound up the dead triumphantly

[Pre-Chorus]
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast
Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast

[Verse 2]
Stir the limbs across the wrist
Full possession of a memory
Bury me as a dog
Oh, icy hands surrounding me

[Pre-Chorus]
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see

[Verse 3]
Shriek the lips across ragged tongue
Convulsing two together, sing violently

You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see
