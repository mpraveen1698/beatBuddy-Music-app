37 ContributorsWhen I R.I.P. Lyrics[Intro]
Chyeah
They been waiting for me
Hahaha
What the fuck? The fuck?

[Chorus]
Feel the morning on my face
Ain't a pill that I didn't take
Just a lifetime, could say it's been a long day
'Cause I'ma sleep when I RIP, ba-da-ba-dum

[Verse 1]
Flashbacks
Relapses
Camera flash
And don't forget your hashtag
Rucksack
Uh, white stacks
You're a dead man
Had better rid of that gat
You gonna run game, it don't ever run you, uh
When they bitchin' on your name, you say, "Fuck you too," too
You say fuck a court case, give detective no clues, clues
'Cause I'm Indiana J when I'm trippin' on the juice (Now let's get real quiet)

Feel so, feel so stupid
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ye-yeah, talk to me

[Verse 2]
'Bout to make a big deal, uproar
And I'm in for the kill, La Roux
Bitches lookin' like a meal, contour
Percocet until we can't feel no more
And I smoked somethin' that gon' knock me out, out
But somehow this body just won't stay down, down, down (Now let's get real quiet)

[Chorus]
Feel the morning on my face
Ain't a pill that I didn't take (Ba-da-ba-dum)
Just a lifetime, could say it's been a long day (Ba-da-ba-dum)
'Cause I'ma sleep when I RIP, ba-da-ba-dum11Embed When I R.I.P. Euphoria (Original Score from the HBO Series) Labrinth indie-pop
