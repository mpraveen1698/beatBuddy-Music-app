Hyung, Hyung, Hyung, look over there, she's so pretty
Wow, I really want to date that woman
(Where?)
There, there, there
(Where?)
There, dressed in grey, grey, grey
(I'll go take a look, Ooh)

[Verse 1: J.One]
Excuse me, noona, but do you have a boyfriend?
A-ah, sorry, that must have been too direct
Those guys behind me called you pretty
N-no, I'm just nervous, so I'm rambling on
I'm still an 18-year-old high schooler
Honestly, the last thing noona wants is stubbornness
Although I might be a nuisance
I've been thinking about this for a long time
My friends are making fun of me
Stop for a moment and focus on your gaze
Your entire aura is shining
I'll focus on expressing my inexperienced heart
My sweat keeps flowing and I'm getting goosebumps
One comment gives me eighth grade syndrome
She must have noticed, at first I was confident
This isn't a joke
Time shows that you reaction is probably my love potion

Wow (Woo, oh man)
She's hot (hot, hot)
Wow (Woo, oh wow)
She's hot (hot, hot)
From head to toe
I can't take my eyes off you
Your perfect curves are the best of the best
Guys are already chasing you, teasing you

[Verse 2: SPEARB]
With a smirk, I suddenly enter
I'm sorry you've already been hit on and you're feeling deflated
He's still a baby chick, cheep-cheep (Cheep)
Kids who are jerks and leeches stick to you
I ignore others' long hair, but you make for an exception
Your attitude makes me empty out my heart
Today I fall in love with you
You can be Fiona today, I'll be Shrek
Ugly and immature swag (Swag)
I'll play the role of an emotional
Booby-trap kid to stimulate your motherly love
I'll adopt my past loser game traits
Don't need caffeine to stay up
The street only the two of us walk on becomes a red carpet
There's nothing to be envious about
[Chorus: All, CB97, J.One]
Wow (Woo, oh man)
She's hot (hot, hot)
Wow (Woo, oh wow)
She's hot (hot, hot, she's fine)
From head to toe
I can't take my eyes off you
Your perfect curves are the best of the best
Guys are already chasing you, teasing you

[Bridge: CB97]
Mmm, this is a zoo where nobody can resist their instincts (Cheep)
I'll save you from gangsters better than those little chicks, you  call me zookeeper (Zookeeper)
My position is higher than the 63 Building (Position)
J.One and SPEARB are always freeloading
Mm, but that's okay
'Cause I’m a nice guy who just has a lot of money

[Verse 4: CB97]
Let me take you to a restaurant (Restaurant)
High class restaurant, hallelujah, man in the terrace
I'll show you a full course tonight
I like hot, tell me if you like it hot
Please (Please)
Let me open that door for ya (Ayy)
A lady needs to enter first to have a good look (Oh)
Having the correct basic posture (Ayy)
Iron man in the streets, but I’m better than Tony
[Chorus: All, CB97, J.One]
Wow (Woo, oh man)
She's hot (hot, hot)
Wow (Woo, oh wow)
She's hot (hot, hot, she's fine)
From head to toe
I can't take my eyes off you
Your perfect curves are the best of the best
Guys are already chasing you, teasing you4Embed Curves Curves Norrona sleep
