Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes, these feelings can be so misleading
She turns and says, "Are you alright?"
I said, "I must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating"
"Come and kiss me by the riverside, yeah
Bobby says it's fine, he don't consider it cheating, now"

[Verse 2]
Red hair with a curl
Mello-Roll for the flavor, and the eyes were peeping
Can't keep away from the girl
These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting

[Refrain]
Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new, yeah
I said it once before, but it bears repeating now

[Hook]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
Well, I said it once before, but it bears repeating now

[Verse 1]
Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes, these feelings can be so misleading
She turns and says, "Are you alright?"
I said, "I must be fine because my heart's still beating"
"Come and kiss me by the riverside, yeah
Bobby says it's fine he don't consider it cheating, now"

[Hook]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

[Refrain]
Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
Well, I said it once before, but it bears repeating now24Embed Fell In Love With a Girl White Blood Cells The White Stripes punk
