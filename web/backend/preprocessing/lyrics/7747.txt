16 ContributorsDecimal LyricsCould you let me know?
I could make some time if you wanted
Couldn't find the phone
I guess I got that summer, you said
"I could be alright if you could re-write my life"
And I said it won't faze me, but I reckon I may've been wrong

I should let this go
I could be your water instead, I'll put on my coat
'Cause I could hear you stall in the way you said
"Is it alright to feel like I do, at all?"

Got caught up in the skylight
And the words just all came out wrong

Just called to let you know
This all is getting old
And I could be your water instead

Let me get my head aligned
Help my life be worth your while
Bend my arm, I won't be far at allSee Novo Amor LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also like1Embed Decimal Cannot Be, Whatsoever Novo Amor ambient
