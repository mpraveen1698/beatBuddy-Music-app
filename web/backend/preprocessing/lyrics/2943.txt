12 ContributorsOut of Reach Lyrics[Verse 1]
Knew the signs, wasn't right
I was stupid for a while
Swept away by you
And now I feel like a fool

[Pre-Chorus]
So confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you?

[Chorus]
Out of reach, so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach, couldn't see
We were never meant to be

[Verse 2]
Catch myself from despair
I could drown if I stay here
Keeping busy every day
I know I will be okay

[Pre-Chorus]
But I was so confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you?

Out of reach, so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach, couldn't see
We were never meant to be

[Bridge]
So much hurt, so much pain
Takes a while to regain
What is lost inside
And I hope that, in time
You'll be out of my mind
And I'll be over you

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'm so confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you?

[Chorus]
Out of reach, so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach, couldn't see
We were never meant to be
Out of reach, so far
You never gave your heart
In my reach, I can see
There's a life out there for me4Embed Out Of Reach Rise Gabrielle british
