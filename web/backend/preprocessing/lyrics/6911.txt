You and me
We're meant to be
Walking free
In harmony
One fine day
We'll fly away
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day?
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
In this day and age, it's so easy to stress
'Cause people are strange and you can never second-guess
In order to love, child, we got to be strong
I'm caught in the crossfire, why can't we get along?

[Chorus]
'Cause you and me
We're meant to be
Walking free
In harmony
One fine day
We'll fly away
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day?
Hey, hey, hey

I'm having a daydream we are getting somewhere
I'm kissing your lips and running fingers through your hair
I'm as nervous as you 'bout making it right
Though we know we were wrong, we can't give up the fight, oh, no

[Chorus]
'Cause you and me
We're meant to be
Walking free
In harmony (In harmony)
One fine day
We'll run away
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day? (Uh, uh, uh)
Hey, hey, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You and me
We're meant to be
Walking free
In harmony
One fine day
We'll fly away
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day?
You and me (You and me)
We're meant to be (Meant to be)
Walking free (Walking free)
In harmony (In harmony)
One fine day (One fine day)
We'll run away (We're gonna run away, we're gonna run away)
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day?
You and me (You and me)
We're meant to be (Meant to be)
Walking free (Walking free)
In harmony (In harmony)
One fine day (One fine day)
We'll fly away (We're gonna run away, we're gonna run away)
