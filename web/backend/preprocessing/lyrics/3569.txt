[Verse 1]
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an island
Might even raise a little sand
Yeah

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby
[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
I want to say one more last thing
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back to ya one of these days, hahaha
I said I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back one of these days, oh yeah
If I don't meet you no more in this world
I'll meet you in the next one, and don't be late
Don't be late

I'm a voodoo child, baby

Question no
