Give it to me, I'm worth it

Uh-huh, I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme, I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby (Uh), I'm worth it
Uh-huh (Uh), I'm worth it
Gimme, gimme (Uh), I'm worth it

[Post-Chorus: Kid Ink]
Okay, I tell her bring it back like she left some (I got some)
Bring it, bring it back like she left some (I got some)
Uh, in the club with the lights off
What you actin' shy fo'?
Come and show me that you
With it, with it, with it, with it, with it
Stop playin', how you know that I
With it, with it, with it, with it, with it
What you actin' shy for?

[Verse 1: Dinah]
Just give me you, just give me you
Just give me you, that's all I wanna do
And if what they say is true
If it's true, I might give me to you
I may talk a lot of stuff
Guaranteed I can back it up
I think I'ma call you bluff
Hurry up, I'm waitin' out front

[Verse 2: Camila]
It's all on you, it's all on you
It's all on you, so what you wanna do?
And if you don't have a clue
Not a clue, I'll tell you what to do
Come harder just because
I don't like it, like it too soft, too soft
I like it a little rough
Not too much, but maybe just enough
