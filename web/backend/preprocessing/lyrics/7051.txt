4 ContributorsToss A Coin To Your Witcher Lyrics[Verse 1]
When a humble bard
Graced a ride along
With Geralt of Rivia
Along came this song

When the White Wolf fought
A silver-tongued devil
His army of elves
At his hooves did they revel

They came after me
With masterful deceit
Broke down my lute and
They kicked in my teeth

While the devil's horns
Minced our tender meat
And so cried the Witcher
"He can't be bleat!"

[Chorus]
Toss a coin to your Witchеr
O Valley of Plenty!
O Valley of Plеnty!

O Valley of Plenty!

[Verse 2]
At the edge of the world
Fight the mighty horn
That bashes and breaks you
And brings you to mourn

He thrust every elf
Far back on the shelf
High up on the mountain
From whence it came

He wiped out your pest
Got kicked in his chest
He's a friend of humanity

So give him the rest
That's my epic tale
Our champion prevailed
Defeated the villain
Now pour him some ale

[Chorus]
Toss a coin to your Witcher
O Valley of Plenty!
O Valley of Plenty!
