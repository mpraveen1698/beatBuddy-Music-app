Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion
But I don't need the comfort of any lies
For I have seen the ending and there is no ascending rise
Oh, back when I was younger, was told by other youngsters
That my end will be torture beneath the earth
'Cause I don't see what they see when death is staring at me
I see a window, a limit, to live it, or not at all
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
If you could pull the lever to carry on forever
Would your life even matter anymore?
Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion
But it's not what you signed up for

[Bridge]
I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
But there's this momentary beam of light
You don't have to wait those salty decades
To get through the gate, it's all in front of your face
I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
But there's this momentary beam of light
You might also like[Outro]
I could cross the ocean in a fit of devotion
(I'm sure there won't always be sunshine)
For every shining second this fragile body beckons
(But there's this momentary beam of light)
You think you're owed it better believing ancient letters
(I'm sure there won't always be sunshine)
Sure it's a calming notion, but it's a lie
(But there's this momentary beam of light)25Embed Notion Notion The Rare Occasions indie
