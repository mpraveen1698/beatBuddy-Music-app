1 ContributorEvery Salvo Has a Garfield Toy LyricsIts young craves with the glistening dome
Write a poem out in Rome build a home for a gnome
6” heel on strippers with glass slippers
All bronze zippers cookin ramen in the big dipper
I’m throwin rocks while I sip on the liquor
Churnin butter drivin buggies with the basket made of wicker
I’m makin money rain with the change go get the slicker
Ketchup Packets, waffle crisp that’s a lame dinner
Choppin up the soft in a million $$$ loft
Laura Croft eatin moss with the sauce I’m a BO$$
Bumpin Ricky Ross while I’m usin dental floss
Eating applesauce while I double cross an albatross
Call me maybe Cody Davies lately getting rabies
From babies who actin shady get nakey with old ladies
Cats ain't even frady I’m balder than Wayne Brady
Cool like Tom Brady, Diamond Jim Brady

I’m drinkin many mini soda out in Minnesota
Come on over with the paperwork I’m doin all the quotas
Dressin for a funeral but going to the mall
Getting yoga balls, dry wall and super fancy hand soap
Me and L Kabong be like tight ropes and Frenchmen
Great Dead and incense, bad guys and henchmen
I’m gainin some gut while these hunks flex they pex
Fling caviar with tech decks, lickin up her neck sweat
Read up don’t keep up unless you Kindle Jenner
Wreck sales like Bruce Banner at your local shoppin center
Colder than last winter, we run shit like sprinters
Hard as big bats but sting just like splinters
You might also likeStirrin up the pasta I’m ballin like Matzo
Buy exotic birds from old dorms in Hofstra
My pirate ship does 280, poop decks with nude ladies
Time Crisis trading vessel 86 mateys
Drunk at the zoo and its not even 2
Take a poo in my hand and I fling it at you
Back to my group, stir the soup, rally troops
Black hair and tights she look like betty boop
I’m sharpening bowies and bumpin old Bowie
TNT ain't me change De Channel like I was Zooey
Imma win the lottery and read some Harry Potter
Potato themed playground I’m on the tater toter
Your manufactured psychosis don’t make you smell real
That particular scent makes fake friends and ideals
Eat a meal of harbor seal and refried electric eels
While she plays electric feel I stomp heads with boot heelsEmbed Electric Feel Electric Feel TEEMID french
