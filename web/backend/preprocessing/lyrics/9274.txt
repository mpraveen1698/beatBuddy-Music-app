I couldn't hang
Hang with that same old crowd
Couldn't stay home
And make my momma proud
Oh I got no money
But I think it's funny how
I don't need nothing
Except for my gutter girl

[Chorus]
All on my mind, she's in my head
I know she's my gutter girl
Forget what they say, I'm here to stay
Here with my gutter girl (wooh!)

Don't you know?
You're my gutter girl
Don't you know?
You're my gutter

[Verse 2]
Roller coaster
Yeah she took me up and down
She's makin' me ill
But I can't turn her down
We got no money
But I think it's funny how
I don't need nothing
Except for my gutter girl
You might also like[Chorus]
All on my mind, she's in my head
I know she's my gutter girl
Forget what they say, I'm here to stay
Here with my gutter girl (wooh!)

Don't you know?
You're my gutter girl
Don't you know?
You're my gutter
