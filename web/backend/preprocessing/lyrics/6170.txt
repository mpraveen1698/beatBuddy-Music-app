Love is painful, although love is painful (Uh)
I repeat it like a fool, that's what I always do (Such a pain)
But pain is beautiful (Yeah), it's same as you
Hope turns into disappointment, hope turns into despair (Woo)
The deeper love grows, the deeper the pain gets
I make the mistake of thinking
And hoping it'll be different this time

[Verse 1: G-Dragon]
In the end, how many years would have passed?
There is no such thing as forever
In the end, were we never mеant to be?
I am alone again
Barely, barеly, barely
I thought I only barely found true love
But in the end, in the end, it ends like this

[Chorus: G-Dragon]
My heart is just like the first time
But now it's filled with scars because of you
We keep changing, at your cold voice
I cool down too
We've grown so far apart to turn things back
To linger around each other without any feelings
It was so hard that I gifted you with separation
And after turning around, fallin' without you

In the end, whose fault was it?
There is no such thing as love
In the end, is breaking up losing?
I'm tired and I fall asleep
Barely, barely, barely
Is this point barely our last?
In the end, in the end, are we becoming strangers again?

[Chorus: G-Dragon]
My heart is just like the first time
But now it's filled with scars because of you
We keep changing, at your cold voice
I cool down too
We've grown so far apart to turn things back
To linger around each other without any feelings
It was so hard that I gifted you with separation
And after turning around, fallin' without you
Yeah, fallin' without you, hey

[Spoken: G-Dragon]
Uh, let's go

[Bridge: G-Dragon & Rosé]
I didn't know at first, I liked her empty spot
But after a day or two, I would appreciate her
I didn't know about myself
I thought I could live well without you
Tomorrow will be different from today
It's already been one, two years
As much as the hardships of those times
My lingering attachments increase
I pray that things will change as time passes
For you, my baby
[Chorus: G-Dragon]
My heart is just like the first time (Hey)
But now it's filled with scars because of you (For you, my baby)
We keep changing, at your cold voice
I cool down too
We've grown so far apart to turn things back (Turn back)
To linger around each other without any feelings (To linger)
It was so hard that I gifted you with separation
And after turning around, fallin' without you
