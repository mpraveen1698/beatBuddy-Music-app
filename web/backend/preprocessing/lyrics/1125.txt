Underneath the bridge, tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped have all become my pets
And I'm livin' off of grass and the drippings from the ceilin'
It's okay to eat fish 'cause they don't have any feelings

[Chorus]
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
