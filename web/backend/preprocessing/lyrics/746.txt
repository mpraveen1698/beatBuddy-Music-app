Why do I feel like I'm drownin'?
Like I'm runnin' out of air? Ah-ah-ah
Why do I feel like I'm fallin'
When I'm nowhere near the edge? Ah-ah-ah

[Refrain: Becky Hill & Joshua Grimmett, Becky Hill]
Just let me know
Can you be the one to hold and not let me go?
I need to know
Could you be the one to call when I lose control?

I need your love, ah, I need your love, ah, ah
