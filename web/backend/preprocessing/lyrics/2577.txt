4 ContributorsNext To You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You said you loved me
But what does that mean?
And would you cry if I were to leave?
In my aching hands
Running down your spine
You said you loved me, how?
Wait for me by the water
On the first rain of June
And I'll be there with all the letters I ever wrote
For you, for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's pack our bags
And head to the Rockies, babe
Just you and I
Getting lost in open spaces
When you wake
I'll be right there, baby
When you shake
I'll be shaking with you, hon'

[Chorus]
And when you get tired of this town
Let me know, and we can go somewhere brand new
'Cause when I lay my head to rest
I hope that it's always next to you
When you run, when you're gone
Oh, I'll be waiting for you, dear

Don't cry
Know I'm right here, my baby, baby
Know that I
Need you in my life
When morning comes
Creeping in your bed
Just hold me close
To your flesh

[Chorus]
And when you get tired of this town
Let me know, and we can go somewhere brand new
'Cause when I lay my head to rest
I hope that it's always next to you
When you run, when you're gone
Oh, I'll be waiting for you, dear

[Outro]
When you get tired of this town
Let me know, and we can go somewhere brand new
'Cause when I lay my head to rest
I hope that it's always next to you
Always next to you, baby1Embed Next to You Songs from the Valley John Vincent III folk
