[Hook]
Had to get it on my own
And I was all alone
If I didn't persevere
Then I would never know
Would of never known
How much I could've grown
If I didn't chase dreams
Then I would never know, uh
I would never know, uh
I would never know, uh
Everything that I could be
I would never know, uh
I would never know, uh (Yeah)
Everything that I could be (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I thank God I had the confidence
To exercise my dominance
Fulfilling all my promises
The come up is astonishing
Got a lot to prove
And I'm running to the truth
Life is like a game of chess
I knew I had to make a move
Thinking I make what I want
Thinking I aim way beyond
This the life of a don
I'm the king, you're the pawn
Knowing that I'm going to throw my fears away
I've been showing that I know I'm here to stay

[Verse 2]
I would never know if
I wasn't so passionate
I would never know
If I put money over happiness
I would never know if
I wasn't good at balancing
I would never know if
I gave up and stopped practicing
I was young trying to be stable
Like who you know
Made it on the charts with no label?
And no management, I keep it real
If you don't believe in yourself
Then nobody will
