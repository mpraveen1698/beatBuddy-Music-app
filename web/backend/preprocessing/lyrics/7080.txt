You and I up all night
Nothing's wrong, nothing's right
I swear these walls are upside down
I swear the roof is on the ground
Demons don't sleep at night
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I try to turn off my mind
Say I'm doing just fine
But I'm screaming inside like (Oh)
Say these words on repeat
While I'm tryin' to breathe
Now you're counting on me

[Chorus]
So I fake a smile
But I know you know me too well
But it's alright
You're like heaven when I'm in hell

[Verse 2]
You were their heavy heart
Tasted light but fed the dark
I'm waiting for them all to see
I don't deserve your company
To love myself is way too hard
Oh, oh, oh
