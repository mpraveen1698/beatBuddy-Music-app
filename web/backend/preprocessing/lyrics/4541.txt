I can't help but feel my groove
I can't help but feel, oh, yeah
I can't help but feel my groove
I can't help but feel, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, I can't help but feel my groove
I can't help but feel, oh, yeah
I can't help but feel my groove
I can't help but feel, oh, oh

[Verse]
Yeah, I can't help but feel
Like time just isn't real
I only know the space inside this room
License to appeal
The dark end of your deal
I'm stoking up the fire that I once knew
So if you see me you know that I've been on my roll
I've been on my roll with you
Yeah, if you need me, I'll show you
How to break the mold
It starts with letting go of you

[Chorus]
Yeah, I can't hеlp but feel my groove
I can't help but feel, oh, yeah
I can't hеlp but feel my groove
I can't help but feel, oh, oh
Yeah, I can't help but feel my groove
I can't help but feel, oh, yeah
I can't help but feel my groove
I can't help but feel, oh, oh

I'm moving on and I can't stop it
Bite my tongue but I can't stop it
See the dawn so I can't stop it no, oh-oh, oh
