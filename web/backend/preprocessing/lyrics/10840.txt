Ra-ra-rard

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been a long night, I don't think you care
Searched everywhere, but you're still not there
Feeling sad, but all you do is stop and stare
Devil told me we're the perfect pair

[Chorus]
So tired of being sad and alone
Ran away and I know I ain't coming back home
She wanna put two right in my dome
Won't change the fact that I'll die alone
Bury me with her
She so cold like the middle of the winter
Close my eyes every time that I kiss her
If she leaves, damn, then I'm really gonna miss her, oh

[Verse]
I try, I try so goddamn hard
I let you in, let down my guard
I should've known right then from the start
That you was gonna make me fall apart
Now I'm all alone and I got nowhere to go
Room's getting colder, eyes real low
Heart's broken, but I won't show
It's the sad truth, but I'm better off alone
You might also like[Bridge]
Sadness and emotion
You put into motion
Your love's my potion
Your love's my potion

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been a long night, I don't think you care
Searched everywhere, but you're still not there
Feeling sad, but all you do is stop and stare
Devil told me we're the perfect
(We're the perfect, we're the perfect pair)

[Chorus]
So tired of being sad and alone
Ran away and I know I ain't coming back home
She wanna put two right in my dome
Won't change the fact that I'll die alone
Bury me with her
She so cold like the middle of the winter
Close my eyes every time that I kiss her
If she leaves, damn, then I'm really gonna miss her, oh

[Outro]
(I try, I try so goddamn hard
I should've known right then from the start)3Embed Perfect Pair Perfect Pair Unodavid sad
