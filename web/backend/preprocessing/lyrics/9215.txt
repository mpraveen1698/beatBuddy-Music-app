4 ContributorsCasual Lyrics[Verse 1]
We can take the long way
We’ll get there even if it takes all night
We’ll talk until the morning
Don’t tell me that you’re fine if you’re not fine
And if it’s only pleasure that you’re seeking
Then I’ll be penciling you in for the weekend
Forget about the white noise
It’s chocolate and pajamas till the whole world fades

[Pre-Chorus]
Just right, yes please
We can sink into the sofa for the whole week
Just right, easy

[Chorus]
If we could just break down
Break down these walls
Over some take out
Don’t you worry bout nothing at all
I can get to know you
We can take it slow
Savor every moment
Keep it on the low
Baby just let go
And we can keep this whole thing casual
You might also like[Turnaround]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Jeff Bernat]
We'll take it back to the beginning when we first met
I find it funny how you hit me with the silence
Said lady what's the deal
'Cause I’m diggin’ your sex appeal
But now when I’m with you I feel

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Just right, yes please
Girl, we could kick it at the crib for like the whole week
Just right, at ease
I’ll give you what you need

[Chorus]
If we could just break down
Break down these walls
Over some take out
Don’t you worry 'bout nothing at all
I can get to know you
We can take it slow
Savor every moment
Keep it on the low
Baby just let go
And we can keep this whole thing casual
[Outro]
Relaxation til we take it to the limit
Meditation til we let it all go
Lazy days and hazy nights and new beginnings
If you love me won’t you say so (girl won’t you say so)

Relaxation til we take it to the limit
Meditation til we let it all go (let it all go)
Lazy days and hazy nights and new beginnings
Baby we can keep it casual (so we can keep it casual)

Relaxation til we take it to the limit
Meditation til we let it all go (all go)
Lazy days and hazy nights my head is spinning (I think my head is spinnin' babe)
If you love won’t you say so

Relaxation til we take it to the limit
Meditation til we let it all go (til we let it all go)
Lazy days and hazy nights and new beginnings
We can keep it casualEmbed Casual Casual Johnny Stimson;Jeff Bernat;Jesse Barrera chill
