Listen, baby

[Verse 1: Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrell & Both]
Ain't no mountain high, ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby
If you need me, call me, no matter where you are
No matter how far, don't worry, baby
Just call my name, I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry, 'cause, baby, there
[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from gettin' to you, baby

[Verse 2: Marvin Gaye, Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]
Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me, darlin'
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me, someway, somehow
Oh, baby, there
[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from gettin' to you, babe

Oh no, darlin'
No wind, no rain
Or winter's cold
Can stop me, baby (No, no, baby)
'Cause you are my goal
If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me, oh baby, ha

[Verse 3: Tammi Terrell, Marvin Gaye & Both]
My love is alive (Woo), way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helpin' hand
I'll be there on the double just as fast as I can
Don't you know that there
[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell, Tammi Terrell]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from gettin' to you, babe
Don't ya know that there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough35Embed Ain't No Mountain High Enough United Marvin Gaye;Tammi Terrell funk
