1 Contributor21 Reasons (Shiftbach Remix) (Unofficial Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
One is you make me happy
Two is you set me free
From all the things that held me
Back from just being me
Thank you for all the sweetness
Now I can finally breathe
Now I can finally breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't you see?
I still get frustrated, I can't lie
When you keep on doing things I don't like
And I hate your friends (Your friends)
And I hate your moods (Moods)
And I shouldn't love you

[Chorus]
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do

[Verse 2]
Three is the way you hold me
That's what I'm waiting for
Five shots, weâ€™re getting naughty
Movin' around the floor
You took away the lonely
And I let you comfort for me
Loving the company

But baby, don't you see?
I still get frustrated, I can't lie
When you keep on doing things I don't like
And I hate your friends (Your friends)
And I hate your moods (Moods)
And I shouldn't love you

[Chorus]
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do

[Bridge]
My friends say you ain't good enough
And maybe I should give you up
But I got my reasons and here comes another one
Here comes another one
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Keep on countin'
I shouldn't love you

[Chorus]
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I do
[Outro]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Keep on countin'
I shouldn't love you
But I've got twenty-one reasons why I do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
I've got twenty-one reasons why I doEmbed 21 Reasons (feat. Ella Henderson) 21 Reasons (feat. Ella Henderson) Nathan Dawe;Ella Henderson dance
