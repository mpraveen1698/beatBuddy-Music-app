44 ContributorsLoud Places Lyrics[Verse 1: Romy]
I go to loud places
To search for someone
To be quiet with
Who will take me home
You go to loud places
To find someone who
Will take you higher than
I took you
[Chorus: Romy]
Didn't I take you to
Higher places you can't reach without me?
(I have never reached such heights) Reach without me
(I feel music in your eyes
I have never reached such heights)

[Verse 2: Romy]
I go to those places
Where we used to go
They seem so quiet now
I'm here, all alone
You go to new places
With I don't know who
And I don't know how
To follow you

Higher
I take you higher and I’ll take you
Didn’t I take you higher?
I take you higher
I take you higher and I take you
Didn’t I take you higher?
I take you
[Chorus: Romy]
Didn't I take you to
Higher places you can't reach without me?
(I have never reached such heights) Reach without me
(I feel music in your eyes
I have never reached such heights)

(I feel music in your eyes
I have never reached such heights
I feel music in your eyes
I have never reached such heights)

[Outro: Romy]
You're in ecstasy without me
When you come down
I won't be around69Embed Loud Places In Colour Jamie xx;Romy garage
