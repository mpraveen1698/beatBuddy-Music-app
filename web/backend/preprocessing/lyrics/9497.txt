40 ContributorsThe Champion Lyrics[Verse 1: Carrie Underwood]
Iâ€™ll be the last one standin'
Two hands in the air, I'm a champion
You'll be looking up at me when it's over
I live for the battle, I'm a soldier, yeah
I'm a fighter like Rocky
Put you flat on your back like Ali
Yeah, I'm the greatest, I'm stronger
Paid my dues, can't lose, I'ma own ya, ay

[Pre-Chorus 1: Carrie Underwood]
I've been working my whole life
And now, it's do or die

[Chorus: Carrie Underwood]
I am invincible, unbreakable
Unstoppable, unshakeable
They knock me down, I get up again
I am the champion, you're gon' know my name
You can't hurt me now, I can't feel the pain
I was made for this, yeah, I was born to win
I am the champion

[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood]
When they write my story
They're gonna say that I did it for the glory
But don't think that I did it for the fame, yeah
I did it for the love of the game, yeah
And this is my chance, I'm takin'
All them old records, I'm breakin'
All you people watchin' on the TV
You go ahead and put your bets on me, ay

H is for the hurt, but it's all for the honor
A is for my attitude, working through the patience (Hey)
Money comes and goes, so the M is for motivation
Gotta stay consistent, the P is to persevere
The I is for integrity, innovative career (Career)
The O is optimistic, open and never shut
And the N is necessary 'cause I'm never givin' up

Crushin' the competition, been doin' it from the start
They say that every champion is all about his principles
