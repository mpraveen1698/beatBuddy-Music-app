4 ContributorsCooler Than Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say, "hey", or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me
Cooler than me

[Drop]
Cooler than me, cooler than me, cooler than me
Cooler than me, cooler than me, cooler than me

[Verse 2]
You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

[Drop]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey, or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey, or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than meEmbed Cooler Than Me Cooler Than Me Lucky Luke electronic
