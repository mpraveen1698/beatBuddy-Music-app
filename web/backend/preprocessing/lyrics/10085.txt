6 ContributorsThe Watcher Lyrics[Verse 1]
Born to a flock of animosity
To be judged, to be shamed, no rights and no dignity
Beneath the eye of disdain
Where The Watcher sees the wicked, we compel

[Pre-Chorus]
Offspring of divine regret
Condemn thy Daughters of Death
Gripping the face of the Earth
Return to dirt
Under the Eye…

[Chorus]
Don’t fear The Watcher - sentinel from the skies above
The rebel angel sees through all of us
Bеware The Watcher - thе Earth is erased in Flood
The rebel angel laughs and falls at last

[Verse 2]
Does the Observer make reality?
Does the gaze activate quantum complicity?
Beneath the pyre and pain
Where we jettison body and brain!

[Pre-Chorus]
Offspring of divine regret
Condemn thy Daughters of Death
Gripping the face of the Earth
Return to dirt
Under the eye...

Behold fire and flood!
