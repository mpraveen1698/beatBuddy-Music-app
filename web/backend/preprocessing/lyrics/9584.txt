1 ContributorNow You Know LyricsI would have cut my heart in two
To give you one of the part
And if it's not enough for you
I would have give it in twice

Not sur that you can understand
One of the time I need to go
I feel like I'm lost on your land
Oh now you know

Oh I need you I need you
To know
I'm falling for you
Oh I need you I need you
To know
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you

Oh I need you I need you
To know
Oh I need you I need you
To know
I'm in love with you

I would have cut my heart in two
To give you one of the part
And if it's not enough for you
I would have give it in twice
