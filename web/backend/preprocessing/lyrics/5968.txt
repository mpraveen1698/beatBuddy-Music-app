7 ContributorsReady To Fly Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse]
There's a darkness deep in the ocean
But my head is high in the sky
And angels callin' me over
But my feet won't take me that high
Drownin' in my emotion
But I'm risin' into the night
My spirit cannot be broken
Now my heart's ready to fly

[Chorus]
Give, give me your wings
So we can go high up into the sky
So take me away night after night
I need you to get there, give me the light
And just like the birds take to the sky
I need it for a single moment tonight
So give me your wings, I need it to fly
So we can go high up into the sky

[Drop]
Now my hеart's ready to fly
Now my heart's ready to fly
Givе, give me your wings
So we can go high up into the sky
So take me away night after night
I need you to get there, give me the light
And just like the birds take to the sky
I need it for a single moment tonight
So give me your wings, I need it to fly
So we can go high up into the sky
