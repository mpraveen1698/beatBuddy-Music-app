12 ContributorsWishes Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm throwing out the page I found
The memory about you and I
There’s a time I dreamed about
The place we'll go on a summer night
So take me to your deepest heart
Now I really need proof to go on
Cause my life goes dark
When I know that
I can never be your love (woah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish we never talked
Wish we never saw
But now I know you're just too far
To catch you with my arms

[Chorus]
Wish I never met you
Wish I never touched your hand
On the day I really thought
You are the only one
That I could ever really love

[Verse 2]
I'm not a person that believed
About the things that people talk
But the things you said
They made my world
I never doubted you were wrong (oh)
So take me to your deepest heart
Now I really need proof to go on
Cause my life goes dark
When I know that I can never be your love
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Wish we never talked
I wish we never saw
But now I know you're just too far
To catch you with my arms

[Chorus]
I wish I never met you
I wish I never touched your hand
On the day I really thought
You are the only one
That I could ever really love

[Bridge]
Just tell me that I'm wrong
Or say anything at all
I don’t care if it's true or false
Don't tell me your excuses
Was the love we had honest
Was it ever true

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish we never talked
I wish we never saw
But now I know you're just too far
To catch you with my arms
[Chorus]
I wish I never met you
I wish I never touched your hand
On the day I really thought
You are the only one
That I could ever really love2Embed Wishes Snowdrop (Original Television Soundtrack, Pt. 4) Jamie Miller soul
