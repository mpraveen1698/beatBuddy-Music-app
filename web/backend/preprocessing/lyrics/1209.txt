Mm
Feels so good
Pussy blow me away
Mm, blow me away

[Verse 1]
The way you kiss me when I'm strokin' deep inside of it
I swear you ride it so good (So good)
That pussy blow me away
And I been thinkin' 'bout your smile
All mornin' for a while
'Bout the way you twist your face while I'm strokin' in and out
Girl, you shocked me, I'm so wowed
Got me slippin', I'm like, "How?"
First I met you on the 'Gram, I picked you up and took you out
Let me show you what I'm 'bout
Let them haters run they mouth
You should know you somethin' different 'cause I brought you to my house
Serve you breakfast on my couch
Anything you ever need, you know I'll be there with no doubt
I need you by my side, I hope you're here to ride
I hate to see you hurtin', my lil' baby, wipe your eyes

[Chorus]
Baby, let me pull your dress down (Dress down)
Kiss you from your neck down (Neck down)
Have you screaming "Oh"
Baby, just let me pull your dress down
Kiss you from your neck down
Have you screaming "Oh," them sex sounds

Baby, I need you in my life, it's like there's no one there
Nobody, can I turn to you next time there's no one there?
I need a girl to match my loyalty when times get rough
I turn to you 'cause I know damn well you don't give a fuck
About them, let them niggas hate
Either way, regardless what they saying, we'll be great
Let's go explore the whole world, fuck the skippin' states
You got me feelin' different, I might let it go today

[Pre-Chorus]
Mm-mm-mm, might let it go
Oh, oh, oh, might let it go
Mm-mm-mm, might let it go
Oh, oh, oh, might let it go

[Chorus]
Baby, let me pull your dress down (Dress down)
Kiss you from your neck down (Neck down)
Have you screaming "Oh"
Baby, just let me pull your dress down (Dress down)
Kiss you from your neck down (Neck down)
Have you screaming "Oh," them sex sounds

[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Dress down, dress down
