6 ContributorsCool Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel like this is a bad one
Racked up too many mistakes
Thought you were in for the long run
Now you're just another heartbreak

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you don't know how this goes
If I'm being honest, yeah

[Chorus]
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
I know I said that we'll be fine, but that was then, I guess I lied
It might take a little longer for us to be cool, cool, again
Cool, cool again

[Verse 2]
Had my heart for over three years
Don't think you understand
Probably take double that to see clear
Keeping up ain't part of my plan

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you don't know how this goes
If I'm being honest, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
I know I said that we'll be fine, but that was then, I guess I lied
It might take a little longer for us to be cool, cool, again
Cool, cool again

[Bridge]
We had sketched out our future
You were mine and I was yours
You'll always have a place in my heart
Just need some time to heal

[Chorus]
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
I know I said that we'll be fine, but that was then, I guess I lied
It might take a little longer for us to be cool, cool, again
Cool, cool again

[Outro]
Cool again, baby
