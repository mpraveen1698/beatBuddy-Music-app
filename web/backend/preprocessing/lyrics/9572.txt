Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh, ah
Oh-oh-oh, ah

[Verse 1: Luke Smallbone]
This is for the busted hearts
This is for the question marks
This is for the outcast soul
Lost control, no one knows
Sing it for the can't-go-back
Sing it for the broken past
Sing it for the just found out
Life is now upside down

[Pre-Chorus: Joel Smallbone]
If you're lookin' for hope tonight, raise your ha-and
If you feelin' alone and don't understa-and
If you're fightin' in the fight of your life, then sta-and
We're gonna make it through this hand-in-ha-and

[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone & Choir]
And if we fall, we will fall together
Together

[Verse 2: Tori Kelly]
Ooh, this is for the second chance
This is for the new romance
Sing it for the loved in vain
Overcame, it's not too late

If you're lookin' for hope tonight, raise your ha-and
If you feelin' alone and don't understa-and

We're gonna make it through this hand-in-ha-and

We will rise together (Oh-oh-oh, ah, oh-oh-oh, ah, [we will rise together])
Together (Yes, sir!)

Together we are dangerous
Together with our differences
Together we are bolder, braver, stronger6Embed TOGETHER TOGETHER for KING & COUNTRY;Kirk Franklin;Tori Kelly world-music
