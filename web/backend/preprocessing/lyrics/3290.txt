33 ContributorsPardon Me Lyrics[Intro]
Pardon me while I burst
Pardon me while I burst

[Verse 1]
A decade ago, I never thought I would be
At 23 on the verge of spontaneous combustion, woe is me
But I guess that it comes with the territory
An ominous landscape of never-ending calamity

I need you to hear, I need you to see
That I have had all that I can take
And exploding seems like a definite possibility
To me

[Chorus]
So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
Not two days ago, I was having a look
In a book and I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee
I said, "I can relate," 'cause lately, I've been
Thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from
The burdens of the planet Earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy and the perils of being in 3D
But thinking so much differently

Pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same
Never be the same, yeah

[Bridge]
Pardon me while I burst into flames
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me

[Chorus]
So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same
