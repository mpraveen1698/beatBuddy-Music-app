She was only seventeen
Had the saddest pair of eyes that you ever seen
Wore them lips and a coat that was matching green
But she can't be herself when she's somebody else
In the morning, she would take her mother's wedding ring
But school got pretty tough when they see it gleam
So she hid herself under the mezzanine
Re-enacting scenes, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She dreamed she'd go to California
There, everyone would adore her
And all her mates will call her
'Til four in the morning

[Chorus]
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Is there any life on Mars?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Every morning she would wake up with another plan
Yeah, her mum and dad, they couldn't understand
Why she couldn't turn it off, become a better man
All this therapy eats away gently at the side of her mind
That she never had
Yeah, this story told too many times, it makes me sad
I bet the author made a fortune out the autograph
Give her the money back 'cause
