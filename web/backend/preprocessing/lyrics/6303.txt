7 ContributorsGo with u Lyrics[Intro]
I'll go with you, with you, ah

[Chorus]
Crazy, staring at your body in amazement
Feel me sinking deeper in your ocean
Now I know I'm too far into the waters now to float

[Verse 1]
New light, started in your bedroom on those blue nights
Swimming in the shallow of those blue eyes
Knew that I was yours before the sunrise
Faster, never thought I'd be the one to dive first
Feet can't touch the bottom, and the tide's worse
Falling for you bad, but it's a nice hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't save me now, oh
Don't save me now, oh

[Chorus]
Crazy, staring at your body in amazement
Feel me sinking deeper in your ocean
Now I know I'm too far into the waters now to float

[Verse 2]
Cold hands, desperate for the places they don't know yet
Tasting even sweeter in the moment
God, you shouldn't come without a warning
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Don't save me now, oh
Don't save me now, oh

[Chorus]
Crazy, staring at your body in amazement
Feel me sinking deeper in your ocean
Now I know I'm too far into the waters now to float
Crazy, staring at your body in amazement
Feel me sinking deeper in your ocean
Now I know I'm too far into the waters now to floatEmbed go with u Someone's EP II BAYNK soul
