2 ContributorsMannish Boy LyricsWhoa yeah, oh yeah
Everythin' gonna be alright this mornin'
Oh yeah
Now when I was a young boy, at the age of 5
My mother said I was gonna be the greatest man alive
But now I'm a man, I passed 21
I want you to believe me honey I had lots of fun
I'm a man
Spell M-A child -N
That represents man
No B-O child -Y
That mean mannish boy
I'm a man
I'm a full grown man
I'm a man
I'm a natural born lovers man
I'm a man child
I'm a rollin' stone
I'm a man child
I'm a hoochie coochie man
Sittin' on the outside, just me and my mate
You know I'm made to move you honey
Come up 2 hours late
Was that a man?
I spell M-A- child -N
That represents man
No B-O- child -Y
That mean mannish boy
A man
I'm a full grown man
I'm a man
I'm a natural born lovers man
I'm a man
I'm a rollin' stone
I'm a man child
I'm a hoochie coochie man
I'm a natural born lovers man
I'm a rollin' stone
I'm a natural born lover
I'm a hoochie coochie man
Well, well
Oh yeah, hey
I'm a natural born lovers man
Well
I'm a natural born loverYou might also likeEmbed
