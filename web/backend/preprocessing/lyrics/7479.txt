3 ContributorsSave Me Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm tired of faking it, running away from what I feel
I'm scared of facing it, what if I'm breakin' everything we built

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, how can you give me love?
Like you know how it felt
When all that I have to give
Is myself (Is myself)

[Chorus]
I want you, there's nobody else
If I lose it all, you'll be there to help
If this building was burning
You won't see me running out
'Cause I want you to come save me now

[Drop]
To come save me now
To come save me now
Me now
(To come save me now)
To come save me now

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm overthinking it
Hoping that things can just stay how they've been
Lately my heart's been hurting me
I just can't bear the space that's in between

Well, how can you give me love?
Like you know how it felt
When all that I have to give
Is myself (Is myself)

[Chorus]
I want you, there's nobody else
If I lose it all, you'll be there to help
If this building was burning
You won't see me running out
I want you to come save me now

[Drop]
To come save me now
To come save me now
Me now
(To come save me now)
