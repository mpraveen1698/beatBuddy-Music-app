8 ContributorsWeak Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know what it is that you done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you doing
(Oh, no, no)
It's a feeling that I want to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
But I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

[Chorus]
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In the days, your love's so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me
By my side, I swallow all of my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet, (yeah, yeah)
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

[Verse 2]
Time after timе after time I try to fight it, (yeah)
But your lovе is strong and it keeps on holding on
The system is down
When you around, I try to fight it, (hey)
In my condition, I don't wanna be alone
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
But I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you, you, (oh)

[Chorus]
I get weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, take over me)
In the days, your love's so amazing (Amaze)
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)
By my side, I swallow all of my pride
Your love is so sweet, it knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak1Embed Weak Weak Larissa Lambert chill
