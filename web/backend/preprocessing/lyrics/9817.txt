The only thing I ever wanted
The only thing I ever needed
Is my own way, I gotta have it all
I don't want your opinion, I don't need your ideas
Stay the fuck out of my face, stay away from me
I'm my own god, I do as I please

[Pre-Chorus]
Just wipe your own ass and shut your mouth

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh
I had enough, and you're going down (Shut your mouth)
Whoa-oh
What comes around you know goes around

[Verse 2]
My mind is playing tricks on me
I'm not as stable as I used to be
Pushed and shoved, you know you're going too far
I will not break my back for you no more, I'm gonna go my way
I'm gonna take control
Time to wake up and dig myself out of this hell

[Pre-Chorus]
Just wipe your own ass and shut your mouth

Whoa-oh
I had enough, and you're going down (Shut your mouth)
Whoa-oh
What comes around you know goes around (Shut your mouth)
Whoa-oh
You're getting what your ego deserves (Shut your mouth)
Whoa-oh
What comes around you know goes around

[Pre-Chorus]
Shut your mouth

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh
I had enough, and you're going down (Shut your mouth)
Whoa-oh
What comes around you know goes around

[Outro]
Whoa-oh
Shut your mouth
Whoa-oh
Shut your mouth
Whoa-oh
