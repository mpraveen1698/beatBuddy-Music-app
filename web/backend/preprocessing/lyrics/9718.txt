[Verse 1]
So messed up I want you here
In my room, I want you here
And now we're gonna be face-to-face
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place

[Chorus]
And now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Well, come on

[Verse 2]
And now I'm ready to close my eyes
And now I'm ready to close my mind
And now I'm ready to feel your hand
And lose my heart on the burning sands

[Chorus]
And now I wanna be your dog
And now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Well, come on
