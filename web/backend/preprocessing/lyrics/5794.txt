14 ContributorsFriday Night LyricsFriday night
Put my backpack on to do my thing
But the bouncer wouldn't let me in

He just stood there with a stupid grin
Last time
I went on crying
But I kept trying
Cause he don't know the moves that im supplying
I'll take my glasses
I'm gonna bounce back up
And kick some asses
I've waited long enough
You think you own me
You don't control me
You think you hurt me
Saying that I'm freaky
You're just a fake
I'm here to stay
Just cuz I'm different
I shouldn't walk away

You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you
You might also likeYou're a freak
Don't belong cuz you're alone and weak
But I'm just as cool as I am geek
Mr. Power I am all on fleek
And this time
I won't be crying
No, I'm not buying
You know the slide as the moves I'm supplying
I'll take my glasses
I'm gonna bounce back up
And kick some asses
I'm bout to call your bluff

You think you own me
You don't control me
You think you hurt me
Saying that I'm freaky
You're just a fake
I'm here to stay
Not gonna be that geek who walked away

You think you own me
You don't control me
You think you hurt me
Saying that I'm freaky
You're just a fake
I'm here to stay
Just cuz I'm different
I shouldn't walk away
You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you

You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you4Embed Friday Night‬‬‬ Friday Night Vigiland electronic
