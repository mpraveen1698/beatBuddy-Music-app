2 ContributorsForgot About Us Lyrics[Verse 1]
What if I wasn't meant to be happy?
And what if I believed in more lies than the stars up in the sky?
Now I'm calling for a taxi
While you're sitting in his backseat
You took him to the place we used to lie

[Pre-Chorus]
These city lights
Don't shine so bright
Now that you're not mine

[Chorus]
Don't say you're sorry and don't say I'm yours
When I'm not the only one that you're falling for
Don't say you love me 'cause it just makes it worse
I'm losing my balance on the edge of your words

[Post-Chorus]
I'm making friends with the ceiling
While you're busy sleeping on the other side
Of someone's bed tonight
Hate that I miss you after all that you've done
I'll never forget how you forgot about us
Forgot about us

Only you know how to make my heart break
And only you know all the words to say to make it all alright
You shoulda never put your phone down
What a stupid way to find out
Better leave this place and get you off my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
These city lights
So far behind
Now that you're not mine

[Chorus]
Don't say you're sorry and don't say I'm yours
When I'm not the only one that you're falling for
Don't say you love me 'cause it just makes it worse
I'm losing my balance on the edge of your words

[Post-Chorus]
I'm making friends with the ceiling
While you're busy sleeping on the other side
Of someone's bed tonight
Hate that I miss you after all that you've done
I'll never forget how you forgot about us
Forgot about us, oh-ooh-ooh, oh-ooh
[Bridge]
I'm making friends with the ceiling
While you're busy sleeping on the other side
Of someone's bed tonight
I'm lying here barely breathing
While you're catching feelings
On the other side
Of someone's bed tonight

[Outro]
Hate that I miss you
After all that you've done
I'll never forget how you forgot about us
