When I hold you close to me
I could always see a house by the ocean
Last night I could hear the waves
As I heard you say, "All that I want is to be yours"

[Chorus]
Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before
With you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart

[Verse 2]
Back when you were far away
We would go on dates to watch the same movie
And you were imagining sitting next to me
Holding my hand for the whole thing

[Chorus]
Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before
With you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart
