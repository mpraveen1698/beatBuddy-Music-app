If I don't have you with me, I'm alone
You know I never know which way to go
I think I need you with me for all-time
When I need new direction for my mind
You listen to my lectures on the phone
You help me find the treasure in the hole
You'll tell me if I'm acting like a fool
I know that you're not something to lose, now

[Chorus]
I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use
You're my only compass
I might get lost without you

[Verse 2]
Could you tell me where to go?
You're always there to help me when I'm down
I'm lucky you've been keeping me around
You're the star I look for every night
When it's dark, you'll stick right by my side

[Chorus]
I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use (I keep you in my pocket)
You're my only compass (Yeah)
I might get lost without you
You might also like[Bridge]
Like a magnet
Hard to imagine ever changing
Anything changing my way
Baby, like a magnet
Can't help that I'm attracted to you, I am
Could you keep on guiding me?
Please

[Extended Chorus]
I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use
You're my only compass
I might get lost without you
(I might get lost without you)
I've got something to confess
I might get lost without you
You're my only compass
I might get lost without you46Embed Compass Hard To Imagine The Neighbourhood Ever Changing The Neighbourhood alternative
