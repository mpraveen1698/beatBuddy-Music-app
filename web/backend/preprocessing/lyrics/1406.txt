Thought I saw your shadow under the door
Just a trick of the light I've seen before
I can never tell what's real anymore
Anymore, anymore

[Verse 2]
I remember when we ran from the pool
All the decorations up in your room
And I couldn't find the right words to use
But I knew that you knew

[Pre-Chorus]
It's seemed so long, it's seemed so long
The moments that stay, they turn out all wrong
When I look around, you're gone

[Chorus 1]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
All the places I return to
All the faces that remind you

[Chorus 2]
I can still see you at the place I know when I close my eyes
Do you remember when we felt like the only two alive?
Don't let me be one of the people that seek a lost romance
Would you go and do it all over again, given the chance?
