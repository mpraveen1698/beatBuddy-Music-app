7 ContributorsStand By Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus]
So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

[Verse 2]
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus]
So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand now, stand by me

[Bridge]
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand by, stand by me
