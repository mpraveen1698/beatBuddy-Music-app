(Those days)

[Chorus]
When Heaven takes you home
And you're at the gates alone
If the grass isn't greener
Come back and check I'm still breathin'
When Heaven takes you home
And you're untouchable
Tell 'em how you back flip through tragic
Show 'em how to struggle, make magic

[Drop]
(Those days)
Make magic
(Those days)

[Verse]
There's nothin' wrong with you
But it has hurt to watch you fade away
I don't wanna see the end of the world without you
(Those days)
There's nothin' wrong with you
You're perfect, you'rе cool
You take the best parts of you
Show mе what love can do
You might also like[Chorus]
When Heaven takes you home
And you're at the gates alone
If the grass isn't greener
Come back and check I'm still breathin'
When Heaven takes you home
And you're untouchable
Tell 'em how you back flip through tragic
Show 'em how to struggle, make magic

[Build]
(Those days)
Make magic
Show 'em how to struggle, make magic

[Drop]
(Those days)
Make magic
(Those days)
Make magic
(Those days)
Make magic
(Those days)
(Those days)
(Those days)
[Outro]
Make me small
So I can fit in your pockets when you go
'Cause when you're gone
