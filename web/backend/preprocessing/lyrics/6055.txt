4 Contributors​​​​better off without me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hard to say
If it's haunted in these hallways
But the ghost of us is always hanging around
I'll take the blame
But I can't change the hurt you're feeling
Falling too hard left us needing solid ground

[Pre-Chorus]
When we started this with the reckless promises
I never wanted it to end, oh

[Chrous]
I guess love isn't what I thought
We were blinded by the hope we got
We were slow dancing in the dark
Do you remember, remember?
Fell so deep we couldn't see
Maybe we were never meant to be
One day I'll just be a memory and you'll be better

[Post-Chorus]
Better off without me
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Better off without me
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

I like to think
I was not the destination
Just a temporary stop along the way
Won't be long now
Someday when you're someone else's
Yeah, you'll say it's for the best we walked away, oh

[Chrous]
I guess love isn't what I thought
We were blinded by the hope we got
We were slow dancing in the dark
Do you remember, remember?
Fell so deep we couldn't see
Maybe we were never meant to be
One day I'll just be a memory and you'll be better

[Post-Chorus]
Better off without me
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Better off without me
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
I guess love isn't what I thought
We were blinded by the hope we got
We were slow dancing in the dark
Do you remember, remember?
Fell so deep we couldn't see
Maybe we were never meant to be
One day I'll just be a memory and you'll be better
Better off without meEmbed better off without me better off without me Matt Hansen singer-songwriter
