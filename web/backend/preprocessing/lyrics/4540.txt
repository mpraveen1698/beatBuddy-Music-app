30 ContributorsWhen I Am Older Lyrics[Intro]
What was that? Samantha?

[Verse 1]
This will all make sense when I am older
Someday, I will see that this makes sense
One day when I'm old and wise
I'll think back and realize
That these were all completely normal events
Ah

[Verse 2]
I'll have all the answers when I'm older
Like why we're in this dark enchanted wood
I know in a couple years
These will seem like childish fears
And so I know this isn't bad, it's good
Excuse me

[Verse 3]
Growing up means adapting
Puzzling out your world and your place
When I'm more mature, I'll feel totally secure
Being watched by something with a creepy, creepy face
Ah, ah
You might also like[Verse 4]
See, that will all make sense when I am older
So there's no need to be terrified or tense
I'll just dream about a time
When I'm in my agéd prime
'Cause when you're older
Absolutely everything makes sense
