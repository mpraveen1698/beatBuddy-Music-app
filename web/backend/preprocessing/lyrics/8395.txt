11 ContributorsWorld So Cold Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd feel this
Guilty and I'm broken down inside
Living with myself, nothing but lies
I always thought I'd make it
But never knew I'd let it get so bad
Living with myself is all I have

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel numb
I can't come to life
I feel like I'm frozen in time

[Chorus]
Living in a world so cold
Wasting away
Living in a shell with no soul
Since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away

[Verse 2]
Do you ever feel me?
Do you ever look deep down inside
Staring at yourself, paralyzed
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I feel numb
I can't come to life
I feel like I'm frozen in time

[Chorus]
Living in a world so cold
Wasting away
Living in a shell with no soul
Since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away from me

[Bridge]
I'm too young (I'm too young)
To lose my soul
I'm too young (I'm too young)
To feel this old
So long (So long)
I'm left behind
I feel like I'm losing my mind

[Verse 2]
Do you ever feel me?
Do you ever look deep down inside
Staring at your life, paralyzed
[Chorus]
Living in a world so cold
Wasting away
Living in a shell with no soul
Since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away from me

[Outro]
I'm too young (I'm too young)
I'm too young (I'm too young)13Embed World so Cold Life Starts Now Three Days Grace grunge
