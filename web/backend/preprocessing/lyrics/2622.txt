There will come a soldier
Who carries a mighty sword
He will tear your city down, oh lei oh lai oh Lord
Oh lei, oh lai, oh lei, oh Lord
He will tear your city down, oh lei oh lai oh Lord

[Verse 2]
There will come a poet
Whose weapon is His word
He will slay you with His tongue, oh lei oh lai oh Lord
Oh lei, oh lai, oh lei, oh Lord
He will slay you with His tongue, oh lei oh lai oh Lord

[Verse 3]
There will come a ruler
Whose brow is laid in thorn
Smeared with oil like David's boy, oh lei oh lai oh Lord
Oh lei, oh lai, oh lei, oh Lord
Smeared with oil like David's boy, oh lei oh lai oh Lord
Oh lei, oh lai, oh lei, oh Lord
He will tear your city down, oh lei oh lai... oh
