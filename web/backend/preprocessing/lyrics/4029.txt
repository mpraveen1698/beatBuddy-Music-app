74 ContributorsThrough the Fire and Flames Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
On a cold winter morning
In the time before the light
In flames of Death's eternal reign
We ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down
And the times are tough, alright
The sound of evil laughter falls
Around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain
We watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again we know

[Pre-Chorus]
So now, we fly ever free, we're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness, our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

[Chorus]
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives, all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on!

[Verse 2]
As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back through the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars
In your darkest dreams, see to believe
Our destiny this time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day, this misery must go on

[Chorus]
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives, all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on!
[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Now, here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard now, can we understand?
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man

[Chorus]
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives, all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on!
