7 ContributorsHot In It (Tiësto’s Hotter Mix) Lyrics[Intro: Charli XCX]
It's Charli, baby
Tiësto

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
You won't see me cryin' on the bathroom floor
I ain't never comin' back for more
Wanna see you walkin' out that door
Bye-bye, bye-bye
You won't see me beggin' for a second chance
Say I need you 'cause it don't make sense
Boy, you just lost a ten out of ten
Won't lie, lie, lie

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Tonight, I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight, I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight, I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it (Yeah)
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it

Movin' till my feet get sore
Hands all on me till my dress gets torn
Watch me do it, do it real hardcore
My, my, my, my
You and me, we never, ever made much sense
I'm too independent, no offence
Boy, don't be sad about the things I said
Don't cry, cry, cry

[Rise: Charli XCX]
Tonight, I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it (Hot in it)
(I look hot in it)

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight, I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight, I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it (Yeah)
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight, I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it (Yeah)
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in itEmbed Hot In It - Tiësto’s Hotter Mix Hot In It (Tiësto’s Hotter Mix) Tiësto;Charli XCX trance
