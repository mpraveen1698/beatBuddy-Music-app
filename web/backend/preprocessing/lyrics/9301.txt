I don't remember the moment I tried to forget
I lost myself, is it better not said
Now I'm closer to the edge

It was a thousand to one and a million to two
Time to go down in flames and I'm taking you
Closer to the edge

[Chorus]
No, I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
(Can you, can you, can you, can you)
Can you imagine a time when the truth ran free?
The birth of a sun, the death of a dream
Closer to the edge
This never ending story
Paid for with pride and faith
We all fall short of glory
Lost in our fate
You might also like[Chorus]
No, I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
(No, no, no, no)

[Bridge]
(No, no, no, no)
I will never forget (No, no)
I will never regret  (No, no)
I will live my life (No, no, no, no)
I will never forget (No, no)
I will never regret (No, no)
I will live my life

[Chorus]
No, I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
(No, no, no, no)

[Post-Chorus]
Closer to the edge
Closer to the edge
(No, no, no, no)
Closer to the edge
Closer to the edge
(No, no, no, no)
