Astronaut

[Chorus]
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, yeah
What you know about rollin’ down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean

[Verse 1]
She say that I'm cool
I'm like "Yeah, that’s true"
I believe in G-O-D
Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb
I'ma play her for fun
Y'all don't rеally know my mental
Let me givе you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn’t know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I’ma kill everything like this purge

Let's just get this straight for a second, I’ma work
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it
Everything that I do is electric
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin’ like kinetic, yeah

[Verse 2]
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, la-la-la-la
Both hands together, God, let me pray
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine
They say that I'm so fine
You could never match my grind
Please do not, not waste my time

[Chorus]
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, yeah
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean1Embed Astronaut In The Ocean Astronaut In The Ocean Our Last Night metalcore
