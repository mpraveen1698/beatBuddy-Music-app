From the breaking of the day to the middle of night
From the breaking of the day to the middle of night
From the breaking of the day to the middle of night
From the breaking of the day to the middle of night

[Verse 1]
Summertime and I'm caught in the feeling
Getting high and I'm up on the ceiling
I don't know what you're doing in New York
All I know is you ain't on my bedroom floor

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm seein' you undressed in my room
But it's just a memory, a fantasy
Are you in your house? Are you going out?
Are you going crazy like me?
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night

[Chorus]
I try to forget about you, baby
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why, I don't know why you're dancing in my mind
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
All the time
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
All the time

Everyone's been wearing your perfume
Everything is reminding me of you
I don't know what I'm doing in New York
But all I know is you ain't walking through the door

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm seein' you undressed in my room
But it's just a memory, a fantasy
Are you in your house? Are you going out?
Are you going crazy like me?
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night

[Chorus]
I try to forget about you, baby
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why, I don't know why you're dancing in my mind
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
I try to forget about you, baby
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why, I don't know why you're dancing in my mind
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night (Yeah)

[Bridge]
And I wonder if you think about me, too
Where we used to go, what we used to do
And I wonder if you're crying out inside, oh yeah
(From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night)
(From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night)
Oh whoa
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
[Chorus]
I try to forget about you, baby (I try)
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why (I don't know why)
I don't know why you're dancing in my mind (Yeah)
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
I try to forget about you, baby (Baby, baby)
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why, I don't know why you're dancing in my mind
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
All the time
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
All the time
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night9Embed All the Time All the Time Zara Larsson swedish
