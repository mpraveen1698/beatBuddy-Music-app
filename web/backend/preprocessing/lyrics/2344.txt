21 ContributorsCherry Blossoms Lyrics[Intro]
(You make me sic)
(Crash)
While having sex for breakfast, yeah
I, I, I'll bite your soul and you'll like it
While having sex for breakfast, yeah
(Fuck you, Shady)

[Chorus]
Cherry blossoms all around town
I need your love and I need it right now
Let's go for a skate, we can slide all around
You runnin' through my head, goin' 'round and 'round
I think I got somethin' that you can't see
Look in the mirror, see you're so lovely
Before I met you, girl, I was so lonely
I been through it before, so girl, don't break me
I keep a 4.5 just for the Ghost
You got me goin' crazy, I'm doin' the most
Think you really stole my heart, I don't know where to go
I wanna be with you, it don't matter how far
I don't even go outside, only if I'm with you
I can grab the moon for you and put it by you
Maybe sit and watch the stars in my drop top coupe
Maybe hold your hand, girl, it's just me and you
You might also like[Verse]
I don't care about these hoes
They steady tryna slide, but I'm duckin' love smoke
I'm tryna be with you and I hope you understand
Just 'cause I got attention don't mean I'm a fan
Swear I really make time and it's all for you
I'm tryna get through 'cause I'm all for you
Your friends call you crazy, sayin' that I'm not true
I'ma be there when you need me 'cause I love you

[Bridge]
I needed you, can't be hopeless
Needed you, I'm so cautious
Don't wanna break down when I hold you
My heart falls down into pieces

[Chorus]
Cherry, cherry blossoms all around town
I need your love and I need it right now
Let's go for a skate, we can slide all around
You runnin' through my head, goin' 'round and 'round
I think I got somethin' that you can't see
Look in the mirror, see you're so lovely
Before I met you, girl, I was so lonely
I been through it before, so girl, don't break me
I keep a 4.5 just for the Ghost
You got me goin' crazy, I'm doin' the most
Think you really stole my heart, I don't know where to go
I wanna be with you, it don't matter how far
I don't even go outside, only if I'm with you
I can grab the moon for you and put it by you
Maybe sit and watch the stars in my drop top coupe
Maybe hold your hand, girl, it's just me and you
[Outro]
(Fuck you, Shady)
I needed you, can't be hopeless
Needed you, I'm so cautious
Don't wanna break down when I hold you
My heart falls down into pieces
