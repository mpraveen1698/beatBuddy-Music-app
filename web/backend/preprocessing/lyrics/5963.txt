Tell her "try your best" just to make it quick
Come attend to the sick
'Cause there must be something she can do
This heart is broken in two
Tell her it's a case of emergency
There's a patient by the name of Gregory

[Chorus]
Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this thirst
My night nurse, oh, gosh
Oh, the pain is getting worse

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna see no doc
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock
'Cause there's no prescription for me
She's the one, the only remedy

[Chorus]
Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this thirst
My night nurse
Oh, the pain is getting worse
I'm hurt, my love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I don't wanna see no doc
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock
'Cause there's no prescription for me
She's the one, the only remedy

[Chorus]
Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this thirst
My night nurse
Oh, the pain is getting worse
I'm hurt, my love
And I'm sure
No doctor can cure

[Outro]
Night nurse
Night nurse, oh, gosh8Embed Night Nurse Night Nurse (Expanded Edition) Gregory Isaacs dub
