Life's alright in Devil Town
We're right, no one's gonna catch us now
Dad has bought a new car now
We're fine, no one's gonna catch us now (Okay)
(Hey!)

[Verse 1]
You said something dumb again
She's mad, at least that's what they say
Mum and Daddy aren't in love
That's fine, I'll settle for two birthdays

[Chorus]
Devil Town is colder in the summertime
I'll lose my mind at least another thousand times
Hold my hand tight, we'll make it another night
I still get a little scared of something new
But I feel a little safer when I'm with you
Falling doesn't feel so bad when I know you've fallen this way too

[Verse 2]
We're all dead in Devil Town
That's fine, 'cause nothing's gonna scare us now
We're all in our dressing gowns, mine's white and stripey
Yours is green and brown
You might also like[Verse 3]
I forgot my name again
I think that's something worth remembering
Spiders in your favourite shoes
Just leave them be 'cause they're more scared of you

[Chorus]
Devil Town is colder in the summertime
I'll lose my mind at least another thousand times
Hold my hand tight, we'll make it another night
I still get a little scared of something new
But I feel a little safer when I'm with you
Falling doesn't feel so bad when I know you've fallen this way too

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Devil Town is colder in the summertime
I'll lose my mind at least another thousand times
Hold my hand tight, we'll make it another night
I still get a little scared of something new
But I feel a little safer when I'm with you
Falling doesn't feel so bad when I know you've fallen this way too58Embed Devil Town Cavetown Cavetown indie-pop
