30 ContributorsCloud 9 Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't wanna seem the way I do
But I'm confident when I'm with you
Lately, all I feel is bad and bruised
Tired of tripping on my shoes

[Chorus]
But when he loves me, I feel like I'm floating
When he calls me pretty, I feel like somebody
Even when we fade eventually to nothing
You will always be my favorite form of loving

[Verse 2]
When I start to tumble from the sky
You remind me how to fly
Lately, I've been feeling not alive
But you bring me back to life

[Chorus]
But when he loves me, I feel like I'm floating
When he calls me pretty, I feel like somebody
Even when we fade eventually to nothing
You will always be my favorite form of loving

[Instrumental Bridge]

But when he loves me, I feel like I'm floating
When he calls me pretty, I feel like somebody
Even when we fade eventually to nothing
You will always be my favorite form of loving16Embed Cloud 9 Honeymoon Beach Bunny indie
