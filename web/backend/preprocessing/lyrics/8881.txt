8 ContributorsTouch Lyrics[Intro: BabyJake]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1: BabyJake]
So many things left unsaid
It might be hard to accept
Won't you be honest? (Honest)
Won't you be honest? (Honest)
It's hard to call you a friend
Don't try to misrepresent
Girl, why you stoppin'? (Stoppin')
Girl, why you stoppin'? (Stoppin')

[Pre-Chorus: BabyJake]
You (Don't hesitate)
Put me through it (I'm here to stay)
Girl, you (Can't make me wait)
When you act like this when we're alone

[Chorus: BabyJake]
I only wanna touch your body
I only want you (Only want you)
I only wanna touch your body
I only want you (Only want you)
I only wanna touch your body
I only want you (Only want you)
I only wanna touch your body
I only want you (Only want you)
