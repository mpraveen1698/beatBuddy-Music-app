Millionaire say, got a big shot deal?
Iâ€™ve thrown it all away, but
But I'm not too sure how I'm supposed to feel
Or what I'm supposed to say, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels
To handle everyday

[Chorus]
And I miss you, love

[Verse 2]
Make room for the prey
'Cause I'm coming in with what I want to say, but
It's gonna hurt
And I love the pain
A breeding ground for hate, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels
To handle every day
Like the one that just passed
In the crowds of all the people
You might also like[Interlude]
Remember today
I've no respect for you

[Chorus]
And I miss you, love
And I miss you, love

[Verse 3]
I love the way you love
But I hate the way I'm supposed to love you back
And it's just a fad part of the teen, teenage angst brigade, and

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels
To handle every day
Like the one that just passed
In the crowds of all the people

[Interlude]
Remember today
I've no respect for you

[Chorus]
And I miss you, love
And I miss you, love
[Interlude]
Remember today
I've no respect for you

[Chorus]
And I miss you, love
And I miss you

[Outro]
I love the way you love
But I hate the way I'm supposed to love you back2Embed Miss You Love Neon Ballroom Silverchair grunge
