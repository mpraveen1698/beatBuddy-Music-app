4 ContributorsPart of Your World (Jodi Benson Cover) LyricsLook at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here you think
"She's got everything"
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty
But who cares? No big deal, I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'
Walking around on those - what do you call 'em? Feet

Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a - what's that word again? Street

Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free - wish I could be
