54 ContributorsThe Spirit of Radio Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Begin the day with a friendly voice
A companion unobtrusive
Plays that song that's so elusive
And the magic music makes your morning mood

[Verse 2]
Off on your way, hit the open road
There is magic at your fingers
For the spirit ever lingers
Undemanding contact in your happy solitude
[Chorus]
Invisible airwaves crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle with the energy
Emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength
Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free
[Verse 3]
All this machinery making modern music
Can still be open-hearted
Not so coldly charted
It's really just a question of your honesty
Yeah, your honesty
One likes to believe in the freedom of music
But glittering prizes
And endless compromises
Shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Invisible airwaves crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle with the energy
Emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength
Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
For the words of the profits
Were written on the studio wall
Concert hall
And echoes with the sound
Of salesmen
Of salesmen
Of salesmen!13Embed The Spirit Of Radio Permanent Waves Rush hard-rock
