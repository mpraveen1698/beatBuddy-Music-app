P-p-porn star dancing

[Verse 1: Matt Walst]
Kelly won't kiss my friend Cassandra
Jessica won't play ball
Mandy won't share her friend Miranda
Doesn't anybody live at all?
Amanda won't leave me empty-handed
Got her number from a bathroom stall
Brandy just got way too much baggage
And that shit just gets old (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Walst]
But I got a girl who can put on a show
The dollar decides how far you can go

[Chorus: Matt Walst]
She wraps those hands around that pole
And she licks those lips and off we go
And she takes it off nice and slow
'Cause that's porn star dancin'
She don't play nice, she makes me beg
And she drops that dress around her legs
And I'm sittin' right by the stage
For this porn star dancin' (Hey)

Your body's lightin' up the room
I want a naughty girl like you
There's nothing hotter than a

[Verse 2: Chad Kroeger]
Stacy's gonna save herself for marriage
But that's just not my style
She's got a pair that's nice to stare at
But I want Girls Gone Wild (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Walst]
But I know a place where there's always a show
The dollar decides how far you can go

[Chorus: Matt Walst]
She wraps those hands around that pole
And she licks those lips and off we go
And she takes it off nice and slow
'Cause that's porn star dancin' (Hey)
She don't play nice, she makes me beg
And she drops that dress around her legs
And I'm sittin' right by the stage
For this porn star dancin' (Hey)

[Post-Chorus: Matt Walst]
Your body's lightin' up the room
I want a naughty girl like you
Let's throw a party just for two
You know those normal girls won't do
[Verse 3: Ludacris]
They won't do, I need a girl that's kinda frisky
Drinkin' with the fellas, takin' shots and gettin' tipsy
We always wanna party 'cause she sexy as hell
And if I ever get in trouble, bailin' me outta jail
'Cause she a stone cold stunner, hotter than a summer
When she step up in the club, every man and woman want her
She make me wanna get a stripper pole up in my home
'Cause her porn star dancin' has got me in the zone

[Guitar Solo: Zakk Wylde]

[Chorus: Matt Walst]
She wraps those hands around that pole
And she licks those lips and off we go
And she takes it off nice and slow
'Cause that's porn star dancin' (Hey)
She don't play nice, she makes me beg
And she drops that dress around her legs
And I'm sittin' right by the stage
