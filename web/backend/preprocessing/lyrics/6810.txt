5 ContributorsHearts on Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
We saw the writings on the wall
When heathens ruled above us all
Tormented, we still heard the call
You come to bring us down
Wield the scepter, steal the crown
Time on the throne is running out

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause seasons change
But we are still the same
Even though the cold winds blow
The fire burns inside

[Chorus]
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Burning for the steel
Hearts on fire

[Verse 2]
For years shunned by society
Outcasts, condemned for our beliefs
Our legions grew in secrecy
And now the time is here
I see the Templars everywhere
The freedom call is drawing near

We hold our rebel banners up with pride
The colour's crimson
And the hammer is the sign

[Chorus]
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Burning for the steel

[Bridge]
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Hearts, hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Hearts, hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Hearts, hearts on fire, hearts
Hearts on fire, hearts, hearts
Hearts on fire, hearts, hearts
Hearts, hearts on fire
[Chorus]
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Burning for the steel
Hearts on fire
