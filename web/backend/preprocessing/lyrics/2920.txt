24 ContributorsPressure Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm in a mood
I'm still tastin' you
Pacin' around for days
Crave you back with me
Pretend I'll be good

[Chorus]
Give me silence, silence, I just need your touch
Know your violence violence, hides on the tip of your tongue
In the darkness darkness, we go on and on
Always under pressure
(Pressure, uh)

[Verse 2]
Can't take it back (Back)
When you talk like that, no
You make me see red
Still end up in my bed
Know I want that sweat
Aye, yeah

[Chorus]
Give me silence, silеnce, I just need your touch
Know your violence violеnce, hides on the tip of your tongue
In the darkness darkness, we go on and on
Always under pressure
(Pressure, uh)

Always under pressure
(Ah, ah)
