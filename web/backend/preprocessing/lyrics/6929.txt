Starry eyes
How can I get to you, my true little
Starry eyes?
What can I say or do for you, my little
Starry eyes?
Starry eyes forever
Shall be mine
Starry eyes
What can I say to make you listen?
Starry eyes
What can I do for your attention?
Starry eyes
Starry eyes forever
Shall be mine

[Verse]
When I'm alone, I hear and feel you
Wish that I could reach right out and touch you
But knowing you're the one to greet me, and meet me
Two alone in the dark, may it be

[Chorus]
Starry eyes
The sparks will fall on me
Starry eyes
Won't you listen that I'm here being
For you, starry eyes?
Starry eyes forever
Shall be mine
