25 ContributorsStill Got the Blues (For You) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Used to be so easy
To give my heart away
But I found out the hard way
There's a price you have to pay
I found out that love
Was no friend of mine
I should have known
Time after time

[Chorus]
So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

[Verse 2]
Used to be so easy
To fall in love again
But I found out the hard way
It's a road that leads to pain
I found out that love
Was more than just a game
Playing to win
But you lose just the same

[Chorus]
So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you
You might also like[Bridge]
So many years since I've seen your face
But here in my heart there's an empty space
Where you used to be

[Chorus]
So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

[Outro]
Though the days come and go
There is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you4Embed Still Got The Blues Still Got The Blues Gary Moore hard-rock
