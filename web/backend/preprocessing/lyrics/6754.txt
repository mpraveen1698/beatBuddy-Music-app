Lost and broke I feel like we can't get anywhere
Enough to feel like leavin’
Hopeless but I know that this can't be everything
We don't need this heartache

[Chorus]
We could break away if you really want to run
Hard to keep the pace
When you’re staring at the sun
Let's hide away from me
Try to escape from me
Let's hide away
If you really want to run

[Verse 2]
With you I see hope
When before I didn't care
Now I know I need you
I need you
I need you
Now I know I need you

[Chorus]
We could break away if you really want to run
Hard to keep the pace
When you're staring at the sun
Let's hide away from me
Try to escape from me
Let's hide away
If you really want to run

Maybe it's freedom
A chance to keep breathing
Maybe we’re lonely
Maybe it’s freedom
A chance to keep breathing
Maybe we're lonely
Maybe it’s freedom
A chance to keep breathing
Maybe we're lonely
Maybe it's freedom
A chance to keep breathing
Maybe we're lonely

[Chorus]
Maybe we could break away if you really want to run
Hard to keep the pace
When you’re staring at the sun
Let's hide away from me
Try to escape from me
Let's hide away
If you really want to runEmbed Run Run Harrison Storm folk
