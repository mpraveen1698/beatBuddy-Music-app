What are you doing Prompto?
[Bape in that Suave Lee?]

[Chorus]
Pull up switching lanes, better watch it, I'ma take your name
Don't try me motherfucker, I'ma bring the pain
No, this ain't a challenge
Keep it fluent, don't misunderstand
Comin' up quick, gotta blast in the hall of fame

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm insane, cannot blame what they made of me (Nah)
Goth bitch, bang, got a blade with a tendency
Rid of you, a stain in the way so I gotta bleach
Man, you cannot talk so I think it's ‘bout time that I
Go on the road
I'ma ghost
Watching ‘em blow, Geronimo
Coast to coast
Yes, I know
Givin' you a taste of your own medicine
It's evident
Your negligence is hellish bent
No sedimentary
My intelligence is scary as I
You might also like[Chorus]
Pull up switching lanes, better watch it, I'ma take your name
Don't try me motherfucker, I'ma bring the pain
No, this ain't a challenge
Keep it fluent, don't misunderstand
Comin' up quick, gotta blast in the hall of fame

[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait
I just made
Everything you wanted
You can keep the change
And I wanna taste
All the rage
Even if you miss it, I'ma take the frame
I just gotta balance, new balance when I wear the shoes
I just gotta girl and she do what I want her to
I just got a whip and it glides like my revenue
I just made a hit and it bangs like a drummer do
Yeah, she dancin', throw it back, yeah, throw it back
I'm advancing, get the cash, yeah, get the bag
Call it ransom, I'ma take her and her friends
We gon' do a tandem, I'ma buy that bitch a Benz
Okay money longer (Yeah), money stronger I
Just got a couple bottles, oughtta get some models
Huh, go full throttle
Aristotle, I camisado in the night like it's very fatal
Don't let me catch you in the streets as I
[Chorus]
Pull up switching lanes, better watch it, I'ma take your name
Don't try me motherfucker, I'ma bring the pain
No, this ain't a challenge
Keep it fluent, don't misunderstand
Comin' up quick, gotta blast in the hall of fameEmbed Japanese Stutter Japanese Stutter Prompto sad
