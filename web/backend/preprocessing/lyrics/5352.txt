All you ever caused was pain
You can say you're sorry, the evidence is on my
Body, but I never complain
I wear it as a lesson, a curse and a blessing

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, you're not a prophet
Have you forgotten that you're godless?
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, you're on your knees, and
You're tryna speak, beggin' me please, but

[Chorus]
Don't even say what you're gonna say
It's too late, too late, baby
Why did you wait to finally change?
It's too late, too late to save me, oh, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
You watched me
Burn, burn, burn
You watched me
Burn, burn, burn
You watched me

[Verse 2]
I don't even pity your pain
You can use it as a weapon, but I won't ever let it
Pull me back under again
I let you fool me once, but now I'm dead and gone

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, you're not a prophet
Have you forgotten that you're godless?
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, you're on your knees, and
You're tryna speak, beggin' me please, but

[Chorus]
Don't even say what you're gonna say
It's too late, too late, baby
Why did you wait to finally change?
It's too late, too late to save me, oh, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
You watched me
Burn, burn, burn
You watched me
Burn, burn, burn
You watched me

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn
You watched me
Burn, burn, burn
You watched meEmbed Burn Burn David Kushner singer-songwriter
