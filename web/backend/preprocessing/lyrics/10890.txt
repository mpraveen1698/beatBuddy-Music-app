5 ContributorsPetals Lyrics[Verse 1]
To see age in a flower
The dawns are speeding up
You know it'll hurt you
Feel all of a sudden
Tired and teary-eyed
You knew it'd kill you

[Verse 2]
Don't wear a tie that'll choke you
To death in the city
Take it off and forget
Spare the fret that'll make you
Miss all of Summer
Sweat it out and forgive

[Verse 3]
To see loss in a shower
The petals turn to mush
It still disappoints you
Then less of a sudden
You wire your weary mind
To let it deceive you

[Verse 4]
Don't force a smile that'll make you
Resent the city
Play it soft and forgive
Keep the frown that'll make you
Squint in the Summer
Play it slow and forgetYou might also likeEmbed Petals A Mineral Love Bibio chill
