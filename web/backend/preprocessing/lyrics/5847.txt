1 ContributorReady Yet Lyrics[Intro]
(Hey)

[Verse 1]
I can't let go of the feeling now
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart (Hey)
I thought I had you all figured out
I've tried to live without you
But it's so hard to live without

[Pre-Chorus]
You tonight
I thought that I'd be alright
Baby, just tell me why
This bed feels cold without (Hey)
You inside
Oh my and your emerald eyes
Floating on daydream highs
I shouldn't linger

[Chorus]
But I guess I'm not ready yet
I'm lost in my head
I'm not getting closer
I guess I'm not ready yet
You're still in my head
One day, I'll forget
But I'm not ready yet
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
But I'm not ready yet

[Verse 2]
I makе-believe that I'm somеwhere else
But I can't get away from you
I can't get away from myself
I'd rather fantasize, so I close my eyes
But I can't get away from you
I don't wanna live without

[Pre-Chorus]
You tonight
I thought that I'd be alright
Baby, just tell me why
This bed feels cold without
You inside
Oh my and your emerald eyes
Floating on daydream highs
I shouldn't linger

[Chorus]
But I guess I'm not ready yet
I'm lost in my head
I'm not getting closer
I guess I'm not ready yet
You're still in my head
One day, I'll forget
But I'm not ready yet
[Post-Chorus]
I'm not ready yet
I'm not ready yet
But I'm not ready yet
I'm not ready yetEmbed Ready Yet Ready Yet Mokita electro
