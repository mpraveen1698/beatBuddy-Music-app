10 ContributorsHigh You Are (Branchez Remix) LyricsOoh, and I don't care how high you are (Ooh) yeah

Two hands they take me by surprise
I'm gripping on to where I think I should arrive
We lie so vacant in the dark
Take me now so I can wake up, and drift away

And I don't care how high you are
Open your mind, inhale the dark
And I don't care how high you are
Don't wake me up 'til we arrive

And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't

And I don't care how high you are
Open your mind, inhale the dark
And I don't care how high you are
Don't wake me up 'til we arriveYou might also like15Embed High You Are (Branchez Remix) High You Are (Remixes) What So Not;Branchez electronic
