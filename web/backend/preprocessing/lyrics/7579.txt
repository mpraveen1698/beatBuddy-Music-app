Seek me, call me
I'll be waiting
Seek me, call me
I'll be waiting

[Verse 1]
This distance, this dissolution
I cling to memories while falling
Sleep brings release, and the hope of a new day
Waking the misery of being without you
Surrender, I give in
Another moment is another eternity

[Chorus]
(Seek me) For comfort, (Call me) For solace
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart
(Seek me) Completion, (Call me) I'll be waiting
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart

[Verse 2]
You know me, you know me all too well
My only desire - to bridge our division
In sorrow I speak your name
And my voice mirrors, mirrors my torment

(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart

[Bridge]
Am I breathing?
My strength fails me
Your picture, a bitter memory

[Outro]
For comfort, for solace
(Seek me) For comfort, (Call me) For solace
