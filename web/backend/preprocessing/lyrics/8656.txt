Anyone can see clearly you're made for this kingdom
Dancing on the cold roof while your lemon tree cries
Anyone can see dearly that you've got to bring them
Never make another bed where your enemy lies

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Tread not away from your heart
Sweat not, right from the start
Copperbelly hidin' out there in every mirror
Copperbelly try to fill you with meaningless fear

[Chorus]
Someone's in love with emotional pain
Keys to this kingdom that comе with your name
I don't wanna go, she don't wanna know
They don't wanna, so, so, so, so
Easy to need whеn it all reads the same

[Verse 2]
Copperbelly wanna tell you there's nobody out there
Take it on the chin as you look for the win
Copperbelly wanna tell you that you better not dare
Copperbelly wanna sell you a tub full of gin

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We all suffer our losses
We all know the bad breaks
Sleeping on the sled of this old western decline
Living in your head, taking way too much time

Someone's in love with emotional pain
Keys to this kingdom that come with your name
I don't wanna go, she don't wanna know
They don't wanna go, so, so, so, so
Easy to need when it all reads the same

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Clockwork is orange and built for compression
Stumbling upstairs, am I somebody who
Start work is free and so full of impressions
Abstraction face and I look just like you

[Outro]
Take me by my warm hand and I'll be there
I'll be in your evening chair4Embed Copperbelly Return of the Dream Canteen Red Hot Chili Peppers alt-rock
