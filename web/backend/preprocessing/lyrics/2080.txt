You asked to walk me home
But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
And now my feet can't touch the bottom of you

[Pre-Chorus]
You couldn't have, you couldn't have

[Chorus]
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
Who loves you more
So I will wait for the next time you want me
Like a dog with a bird at your door
Mmm

[Verse 2]
We hate "Tears in Heaven"
But it's sad that his baby died
And we fought about John Lennon
Until I cried

[Pre-Chorus]
And then went to bed upset

[Chorus]
But now, I am dreaming and you're singing at my birthday
And I've never seen you smiling so big
It's nautical themed and there's something I'm supposed to say
But can't, for the life of me, remember what it is
You might also like[Bridge]
And if I could give you the moon
I would give you the moon

[Chorus]
You are sick and you're married and you might be dying
But you're holding me like water in your hands
When you saw the dead little bird, you started crying
But you know the killer doesn't understand23Embed Moon Song Punisher Phoebe Bridgers indie-pop
