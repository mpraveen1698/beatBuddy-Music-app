8 ContributorsPsycho! (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Trippie Redd & MASN]
Haha
Big 14, know what the fuck goin' on
I might just go psycho
Too many drunk white hoes
Yeah

[Chorus: MASN]
I might just go psycho
Too many drunk white hoes
Said I won't but I might though
Walking on the tight rope
Do it just in spite though
Backwoods got my eyes low
I might just go psycho
Backwoods had my eyes low

[Verse 1: MASN]
I just left in the Porsche
I'm moving too fast I cannot slow it down
On my way to the morgue
I'm dying young if I don't slow it down
Too much cash in the bag
I'm burning it all, nothing can stop me now
Gave you one more chance
You lost that shit and you just lost a crown
I waste my time, I can't move
It's making me go blind to this new shit
I'm so clueless, saying this is old news (Old news)
But you're not new, you're old news (Old news)

I might just go psycho
Too many drunk white hoes

[Chorus: MASN]
I might just go psycho
Too many drunk white hoes
Said I won't but I might though
Walking on the tight rope
Do it just in spite though
Backwoods got my eyes low
I might just go psycho
Backwoods had my eyes low

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
When you see me, bitch, no photos, no photos (Yeah)
I just swerved off in a Lambo', feel like Rambo (Big 14)
I got two Glocks with hella ammo (Ammo)
I'm Killa Kam, ho
I'm with my niggas, fuck the clan, ho (Yeah)
Hit you, shazam, woah (Bah)
I got your bitch wet like a dam, ho
Don't give a damn, ho, oh, man, goddamn, ho
Oh wow, so damn dope
They wanna take me from my fam', no
I got so damn dope
Like I'm so fuckin' psycho, I got black and white hoes
Run 'em through the night, ho, ah
[Chorus: MASN & Trippie Redd]
I might just go psycho
Too many drunk white hoes (14)
Said I won't but I might though
Walking on the tight rope (Ah)
Do it just in spite though
Backwoods got my eyes low
I might just go psycho
Backwoods had my eyes low

[Outro: MASN & Trippie Redd]
I just might go psycho
Up all night I'm on the road
Lighting feel like old shows
Haha, 14
