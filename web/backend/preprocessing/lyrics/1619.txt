I can't escape this hell
So many times I've tried
But I'm still caged inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can't control myself

[Chorus]
So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
(This animal, this animal)

[Verse 2]
I can't escape myself (I can't escape myself)
So many times I've lied (So many times I've lied)
But there's still rage inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can't control myself

[Chorus]
So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal

Somebody help me through this nightmare
I can't control myself
Somebody wake me from this nightmare
I can't escape this hell
(This animal, this animal)
(This animal, this animal)
(This animal, this animal, this animal)

[Chorus]
So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
(This animal I have become)58Embed Animal I Have Become One-X Three Days Grace alt-rock
