20 ContributorsDance Hall Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take your baby by the hand
And make her do a high handstand
And take your baby by the heel
And do the next thing that you feel

[Pre-Chorus]
We were so in phase
In our dance hall days
We were cool on craze
When I, you, and everyone we knew
Could believe, do, and share in what was true
Oh, I said

[Chorus]
Dance hall days, love

[Verse 2]
Take your baby by the hair
And pull her close and there, there, there
And take your baby by the ears
And play upon her darkest fears

[Pre-Chorus]
We were so in phase
In our dance hall days
We were cool on craze
When I, you, and everyone we knew
Could believe, do, and share in what was true
Oh, I said

[Verse 3]
Take your baby by the wrist
And in her mouth, an amethyst
And in her eye, two sapphires blue
And you need her, and she needs you

[Refrain]
And you need her, and she needs you
And you need her, and she needs you
And you need her, and she needs you
And you need her
And she needs you

[Pre-Chorus]
We were so in phase
In our dance hall days
We were cool on craze
When I, you, and everyone we knew
Could believe, do, and share in what was true
Oh, I said
[Chorus]
Dance hall days, love
