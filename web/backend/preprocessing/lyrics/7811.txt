7 ContributorsEmbody Me LyricsStole, forcefully
forced from me, your body leaves
Fold to your knees,
your body needs, to embody me

Decorated in your bed,
every second that we had was newlywed

oh, where’ve you been,
all soaked marine, in kerosine
Stow your love with me,
my body needs your body heat

Decorated in your bed,
every second that we had was newlywed
Separated in your head
in every present that you had, I was a wreck
Oh, I'm in agony, your anatomy has gone
and the hold that you had of me didn’t have any, at allSee Novo Amor LiveGet tickets as low as $41Embed Embody Me Bathing Beach Novo Amor folk
