8 ContributorsCinder Ace Lyrics[Intro]
(Yungster Jack)

[Verse 1]
Take me where the light is
And I'll tell you where to find it
At the ADA store, I'm with Simon
On the eighty-eighth floor like I'm the highest
And my girl's in a white dress
Got a CBD stogie, baby, light this
Fuck around and I made history, who's coming like this?
Psilocybin in the chocolate, I feel enlightened
And I just powered up, I'm off my supplements
I had a little bit of money then I doubled it
I put down a handful of drugs 'cause I fumbled it
She reach out her hand for a hug, you know what it is
Lion's mane and cordyceps
Bro send me the coordinates
Saw something online that I wanted then I ordered it
Fuck it, I want more than this
I know that there's more to this
Take the money and then forward it
I'm the ace so I'm scorin' it
I can feel it in my skin
'Cause I listened to the words in the wind
I used to walk on ice so thin
And now I can finally move my limbs
Mix the juice with the gin
Walk around and tip up my chin
No, I don't gotta tell my bro shit
'Cause he knows by the way that I grin

Y3 hat with a little bit of dirt on it (Dirt)
XL hoodie, throw another fuckin' shirt on it (Shirt)
Keychains on my belt, back it up and twerk on it (Twerk, go)
They're tryna be like me but it looks the worst on 'em (Worst)
I got evil money coming in, I see a curse on it (Curse on it)
I gotta stop selling these opens, I don't want a nerd on it
I almost lost all my hope like the church was fallen
I had to figure my way out, I had to curveball it
Documents in the drawer
Where's the information? I don't even see a source
I've been working so damn hard, I got dirt in my pores
If you live by the sword then you die by the sword
And the evil documents didn't exist
I cannot smoke regular weed, it makes me sick
They tried to take away my crown 'cause I'm really that bitch
I be off the dirty sticks, I only have one wish
