Kinda wanna make snow angels in the grass
Climbin' on the roof, I don't care if I show my ass
Tell somebody I love them and then take it back
'Cause life gets so damn sad

[Pre-Chorus]
(God) so much annoying shit, but I'ma let it slide
Gotta be up at six, we'll go to bed at five
We'll lose our minds just for the night (Night, night, night)

[Chorus]
Kiss me when you're drunk like you're stone-cold sober
Could be dying young, but we're gettin' older
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I feel like, feel like letting go (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Don't know what we want, baby, that don't matter
I do what I want, think about it after all
I feel like, feel likе letting go (I feel like, feel like, feel likе)

[Verse 2]
Jumpin' on a pool table, like, "That's my song" ("That's my song")
Make out with my best friend, but it's just for fun (Just for fun)
Takin' dirty pictures in the bathroom stall
'Cause we look so damn good

(God) so much annoying shit, but I'ma let it slide
Gotta be up at six, we'll go to bed at five
We'll lose our minds just for the night (Night, night, night)

[Chorus]
Kiss me when you're drunk like you're stone-cold sober
Could be dying young, but we're gettin' older
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I feel like, feel like letting go (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Don't know what we want, baby, that don't matter
I do what I want, think about it after all
I feel like, feel like letting go

[Post-Chorus]
The world could end tonight and we won't know
I don't wanna think 'bout tomorrow
Pour another glass and make a toast
Pour another glass and pour another glass
And pour another glass and pour another gla—
"Okay, we're drunk"

[Chorus]
Kiss me when you're drunk like you're stone-cold sober
Could be dying young, but we're gettin' older
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I feel like, feel like letting go (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Don't know what we want, baby, that don't matter
I do what I want, think about it after all
I feel like, feel like letting go
[Post-Chorus]
The world could end tonight and we won't know
I don't wanna think 'bout tomorrow
Pour another glass and make a toast
