1 ContributorStarShine (I Donâ€™t Want This Night To End) LyricsAll night
Dancing to the moonlight
Being in the spotlight
A thousand stars
They only shine for us
Hold me
Don't let go and love me
Time is going slowly
I don't want this night to end
All night
Dancing to the moonlight
Being in the spotlight
A thousand stars
They only shine for us
Hold me
Don't let go and love me
Time is going slowly
I don't want this night to end

I don't want this night to end

All night
Dancing to the moonlight
Being in the spotlight
A thousand stars
They only shine for us
Hold me
Don't let go and love me
Time is going slowly
I don't want this night to end
