I want a little bit of your love
A little bit of your touch
A little of your special special special nature
I want a little bit of your love
A little bit of your touch
A little of your special special special nature

[Verse: Olamide]
Stop playing games i- wanna see your face (ah)
Back to the days (ah)
You call me on face time before we fell in love and you said I was your crush (ah)
Miss way you blush, lost in the sauce
Now you wanna be alone like huh Henny with no chaser
Pencil and eraser we used to be close
The rеason I chose ya cause you are a soldiеr
You handle your biz like a motherfucking boss ya
Hmmmmm no leave me alone (babe)
Dirty memories keep flashing
Weh me give it to you for the back seat
Ina mi porche ina mi Bentley
Omo your bo-bo body deadly
You ma naughty naughty shawtie
Little cutie thing i’m sorry picture me grabbing your booty muah muah
I know you like that, I hope you write back
Hello no one is available to pick your call please
Leave a message after the tone
Hey babes, holla back at me when you get my messageYou might also likeEmbed Want (feat. Fave) UY Scuti Olamide;Fave dancehall
