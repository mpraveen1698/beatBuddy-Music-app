Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling is just so right
As we dance by the moonlight
Can't you see you're my delight?
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you out of my mind
I feel love for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes

Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling is just so right
As we dance by the moonlight
Can't you see you're my delight?

I won't get you out of my mind
I feel love for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes

As we dance by the moonlight
Can't you see you're my delight?
