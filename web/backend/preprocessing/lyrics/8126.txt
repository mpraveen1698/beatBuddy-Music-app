36 ContributorsEverybody Loves Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, hail Caesar, shadow in my backseat
And her friends are standing right in front of me
World wide from the Cimarron to Turkey
Open up, said everybody loves me

[Pre-Chorus]
And you don't have to make a sound
'Cause they got what you need
What you need
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Got love for the people that have warned you
God love all your sentimental virtue
Eight balls with the takers that'll make you
Late calls with the lovers that'll hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you don't have to make a sound
They got what you need
What you need
Make you say

[Chorus]
Oh my!
Feels just like I don't try
Looks so good I might die
All I know is everybody loves me
Head down
Swaying to my own sound
Flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me

Well, I pray the music don't stop till I turn gray
Stars forever like John Sousa never fade
He had a beautiful child, named her Désirée
Hope I'm remembered for the things that I never made

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you don't have to make a sound
When they got what you need
Make you say

[Chorus]
Oh my!
Feels just like I don't try
Looks so good I might die
All I know is everybody loves me
Head down
Swaying to my own sound
Flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody, everybody, oh
Everybody, everybody

[Bridge]
Don't need my health
Got my name and got my wealth
I stare at the sun
Just for kicks all by myself
I lose track of time
So I might be past my prime
But I'm feeling oh so good
Yeah!
[Chorus]
Oh my!
Feels just like I don't try
Looks so good I might die
All I know is everybody loves me
Head down
Swaying to my own sound
Flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me

[Outro]
Loves me
Everybody, everybody
