How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen, when your heart's not open

[Chorus: Madonna with Sickick]
Mm, mm-mm-mm
If I could melt your heart
Mm, mm-mm-mm
We'd never be apart
Mm, mm-mm-mm
If I could melt your heart
Mm, mm-mm-mm
We'd never be apart (Sick)
Mm, mm-mm-mm
If I could melt your heart
Mm, mm-mm-mm
We'd never be apart
Mm, mm-mm-mm
Give yourself to me
Mm, mm-mm-mm
We'd never be apart (Sick)
Mm, mm-mm-mm
If I could melt your heart
Mm, mm-mm-mm
We'd never be apart
Mm, mm-mm-mm
If I could melt your heart
Mm, mm-mm-mm
We'd never be apart
Mm, mm-mm-mmYou might also likeEmbed Frozen Frozen Madonna;Sickick dance
