Oh, baby
Oh, man
You're making me crazy
Really driving me mad
That's alright with me
It's really no fuss
As long as you're next to me
Just the two of us

[Chorus]
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Begging you please, baby
Show me your world

[Verse 2]
Oh, brother
Sweetheart
I'm feeling so tired
Really falling apart
And it just don't make sense to me
I really don't know
Why you stick right next to me
Wherever I go
You might also like[Chorus]
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Begging you please, baby
Show me your world104Embed My Kind of Woman 2 Mac DeMarco edm
