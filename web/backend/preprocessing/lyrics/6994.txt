Don't get no sleep in the night
But I'm living
You thought you shut me down baby
I used to need all your love
Now I'm all changed
Oh no
I'm on the molly got me feeling crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been had to move on
I fell out of love
I had to move on
Now all these drugs
They're hitting too strong
They made up my my mind
They made me move on, move on

[Chorus]
Now I know I got my game on lock
I don't hustle but I'm still on top
Money coming 'til the day I drop
All these bitches wanna get on top
I got all of these diamonds right on my neck
I'm too busy counting all these checks
I'm in the bentley you but you won't catch me flex
I'm with your bitch and she be giving me neck

Oh oh oh, I used to need all your love now it's all changed (oh no)
I'm on the molly got me feeling crazy
Don't need no love, your love ain't doing me no good
Ain't doing me no good
Yes I'm alone, your love ain't

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been had to move on
I fell out of love
I had to move on
Now all these drugs
They're hitting too strong
They made up my my mind
They made me move on, move on

[Chorus]
Now I know I got my game on lock
I don't hustle but I'm still on top
Money coming 'til the day I drop
All these bitches wanna get on top
I got all of these diamonds right on my neck
I'm too busy counting all these checks
I'm in the bentley you but you won't catch me flex
I'm with your bitch and she be giving me neckEmbed Next Next Shaker soul
