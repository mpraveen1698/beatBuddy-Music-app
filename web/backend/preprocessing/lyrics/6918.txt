I'm just a fleabag, nobody loves me
Send me to rehab, somebody touch me

[Verse 1]
I wanna turn back time
I wanna fix the way I was designed
Crawl behind my eyes
And kill my stale state of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I fade and fade
And every time I try to change, to change
I stop

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a fleabag, nobody loves me
Send me to rehab, somebody touch me
I'm not your monkey
I'm not your puppy
I'm just a fleabag, nobody loves me at all

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, hey
Nobody loves me, yeah
Hеy, hey
Nobody loves me, yеah

I dance 'round the truth
I'll be a ballerina boy for you
No matter what I do
You twist my words and get confused

[Pre-Chorus]
So I fade and I fade
And every time I try to change, to change
I stop

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a fleabag, nobody loves me
Send me to rehab, somebody touch me
I'm not your monkey
I'm not your puppy
I'm just a fleabag, nobody loves me at all

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, hey
Nobody loves me, yeah
Hey, hey
Nobody loves me, yeah
