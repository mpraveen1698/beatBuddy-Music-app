Hmm, hmm
Hmm (Hmm-hmm)
Hmm

[Verse 1]
The summer I turned eighteen
Started with me running from a party
Bella was drinking in the back
My prom night panic attack
Racing, climbing to the front door
Bolted down 29 going 84
Ended the night on the curb
These last twelve years were a blur

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear I was just on the pavement
Laying down while someone traces me
Watching the sky, I thought I had more time
What a lie, I guess that was goodbye

[Chorus]
I guess that was goodbye
I guess that was goodbye

[Verse 2]
Wonder if I can outrun September
It's not the end (The end)
If I play pretend like when we were kids
Make friends with the dark, say, "Stay forever"
Don't let me down, down, down (Down, down, down)
Night's a fair weather friend, lets daylight come in
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Swear I was just on the pavement
Laying down while someone traces me
Watching the sky, I thought I had more time
What a lie, I guess that was goodbye

[Chorus]
I guess that was goodbye
I guess that was goodbye

[Bridge]
But I guess Mr. Clock was just doing his job
And it's nobody's fault, but I wish it was

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear I was just on the pavement
Laying down while someone traces me
Watching the sky, I thought I had more time
What a lie, I guess that was goodbye

[Outro]
I guess that was goodbye
I guess that was goodbye
I guess that was goodbye
I guess that was goodbye2Embed I Guess That Was Goodbye I Guess That Was Goodbye Lyn Lapid songwriter
