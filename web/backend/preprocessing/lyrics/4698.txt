18 ContributorsSix Days (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
I get a feeling there's gonna be a riot
I don't read the newspapers
Because they all have... ugly prints
Check me out
Check me out
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Bring it on cause there's gonna be some shit tonight!

[Verse 1]
At the starting of the week
At summit talks you'll hear them speak
It's only Monday
Negotiations breaking down
See those leaders start to frown
It's sword and gun day

[Chorus]
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

[Post-Chorus]
(Come, come, come, come, come with it)
(Come, come, come, come, come with it)

[Verse 2]
You could be sitting taking lunch
The news will hit you like a punch
It's only Tuesday (What time is it?)
You never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April Fool's Day (What time is it?)
You might also like[Chorus]
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

[Interlude: Yasiin Bey]
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another bomb
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another bomb (Bomb)
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another bomb
Tomorrow is another day
Today is another...
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb...

[Verse 3: Yasiin Bey]
Fire!
Shot!
Escalation, devastation, generation, separation, situation, dissipation
Shot!
Another shot, another shot, the tender vessel pressure pop
The heart is cold the gun is hot (Shot!)
I'm not sure if they done or not
I'm not sure that they wanna stop
The gun is cold the blood is hot (Shot!)
(Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot)
The hearts are weak, the guns are not
[Verse 4]
You hear a whistling overhead
Are you alive or are you dead?
It's only Thursday (What time is it?)
You feel the shaking of the ground
A million candles burn around
Is it your birthday? (What time is it?)

[Chorus]
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late (Get tomorrow on the phone)
(Trying to reach tomorrow)
(Get tomorrow on the phone)
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late (I need to see tomorrow)
(Trying to reach tomorrow)
Make tomorrows come, I think it's too late

[Outro: Yasiin Bey]
Another day!
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb...
(Tomorrow is another day)
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb...
(Tomorrow is another day)
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb...
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Bring it on cause there's gonna be some shit tonight!9Embed Six Days - Remix The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) DJ Shadow;Mos Def electronic
