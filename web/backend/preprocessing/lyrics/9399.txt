Listen up, you got a problem man

[Chorus]
Baby you’ve been on my mind
Baby you’re wasting my time

[Verse 1]
Lotta pressure on my name
Lotta worries in my head
Lotta responsibilities, traps & threats
I canalize, no I won’t break

[Verse 2]
Down at night alone with myself
With my demons and my pain
Maybe if I blow some trees and see that bitch it’ll make all that shit fade away

[Break: Snoop Dogg]
Don’t get distracted
Pleasure is not happiness, stop running away from reality

[Chorus #2]
Baby you’ve been on my mind
So let me smoke
Weed every night
You might also like[Bridge]
Last night I gave up and did it again
I tricked my mind to forget

[Outro]
Baby you’ve been on my mind
Baby you’re wasting my time
Baby you’ve been on my mind
Baby you’re wasting my time7Embed MARIJUANA WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE (Deluxe) Rilès french
