8 ContributorsBad Romance Lyrics[Intro]
Want your bad romance
Want your bad romance

[Verse 1]
I want your ugly
I want your disease
I want your everything
As long as it's free
I want your love (I want your love)
Love, love, love
I want your love (I want your love, I want your love)

I want your drama
The touch of your hand
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love (I want your love)
Love, love, love
I want your love (I want your love, I want your love)

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad, a bad romance

[Chorus]
I want your love and
I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh)
I want your love and
All your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad romance
Want your bad romance
Want your bad romance

I want your horror
I want your design
'Cause you're a criminal
As long as your mine

Love, love, love
I want your love (I want your love, I want your love)

I want your psycho
Your vertigo stick
Want you in my rear window
Baby you're sick
I want your love (I want your love)
Love, love, love
I want your love (I want your love, I want your love)

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad, a bad romance

I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
