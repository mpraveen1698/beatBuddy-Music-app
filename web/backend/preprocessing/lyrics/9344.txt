I know what you like girl, yeah
We playin all these games like Nintendo 69 girl, yeah
Uh, couldn't make it to the top, kamikaze

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I can't debate my mistakes, tryna make sure
That I'm tryna make all these claims, everything clear
I'ma make you feel like this shit last forever
Lemme prove it to ya (Can you hear it?)

[Chorus]
'Cause we be on that honeymoon
Like everything is all good
Even when it all goes down
Still chilling on that honeymoon
You know baby that its all good
Evеn when it all falls down, down, down
Yeah, you know what it's like
Wе be goin' zero to a hundred every night
Still chillin' on that honeymoon
Like everything is all good
Even when it all falls down, down, down

Oh, got that sunset on my dashboard
Oh, riding shotgun in your best clothes
I can't break it to ya
I can't break it
Trying to make it all last, yeah

[Bridge]
We be drowning, emotion
See the signs of an omen, yeah

If we stay stuck in this garden
We ain't gonna blossom, yeah
