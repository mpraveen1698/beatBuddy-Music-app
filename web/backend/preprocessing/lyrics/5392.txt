1 ContributorLife Of A Don Lyrics[Hook]
Know that you a real one know that you earned it
Always had to build up look what you turned in
Bask in your killings after putting work in
Famiglia proud and the fans go worship - x2

[Verse 1]
It's like you too afraid of the lows to be enjoying the highs
They gon wait till you gone to be giving you props
Never took a L, only learning experiences
Never afraid to fail, only thing that I’m fearing is
Not trying, work till I'm feeling delirious
Never dying, cause real ones never do
Won't show out for anyone ain’t into appearances
And I only fuck with people with similar perseverances
Causе disappearances to ones not gеtting clearances
To be in my city but never in the same state
In all seriousness
God giveth god taketh away
But god keep giving me these blessing each day
Lineage made in Italy, I was made in America
Vintage make in energy, imma break any barrier
I'm the man I was meant to be, never played any character
The old me dead to me, only similar exterior

[Hook]
Know that you a real one know that you earned it
Always had to build up look what you turned in
Bask in your killings after putting work in
Famiglia proud and the fans go worship - x2

Half a decade up in Dover
Getting follow after follow found me getting known here
Gifted bottle after bottle now I'm never sober
Fucking model after model they just bending over
Leave the hollow in tomorrows past, rented time
Like once they open up there isn't ever closure
You can do favor after favor but they say you stepping over
Others true colors show in times of your celebration
Most of the time talk it out but when doubt has confirmation
They say they'll hold you down cause they don't want you elevating
They want to blow up quick but they blowing over
We got the gas behind us we just let it smolder
Came a long way from church food and the dial up
They a thousand leagues under the sea and we a mile up
Maz and me agreed each song to keep switching the style up
And if they hate then let them hate and watch the money pile up
People go and prop you up so you're easily shot down
The thought of being counted outs just odd now
So many counting on me it's hard keeping count
To alleviate a grievance, gotta seek em out
When you surrounded by fake the real ones look out of place
Real move in silence and you talk a lot
A lot of people want to dead me
I don’t need to pay for a living space
I live in heads rent free
[Hook]
Know that you a real one know that you earned it
Always had to build up look what you turned in
Bask in your killings after putting work in
Famiglia proud and the fans go worship - x2
