Freezin'
Rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again
Oh, feelin'
Maybe he'll see a little better, set of days, ooh, yeah
Oh, hand out
Faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, ooh, yeah
Oh, dark grin
He can't help, when he's happy he looks insane, hm, yeah

[Chorus]
Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away (ooh)
Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again

[Verse 2]
Kneelin'
Lookin' through the paper though he doesn't know to read, ooh, yeah
Oh, prayin'
Now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin'
Understands the weather of the winter's on its way
Oh, ceilings
Few and far between all the legal halls of shame, hey

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away

Ah, whispering hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away

Woo, ah, yeah
Fuck it up

[Interlude]
Hey man, you got a dollar?
Come on, just some spare change, man, I know you got
Well, God bless you, man, God bless you

[Chorus]
Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again, yeah
Oh, whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away, yeah!
Woo, ah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, mama mami!38Embed Even Flow Ten Pearl Jam grunge
