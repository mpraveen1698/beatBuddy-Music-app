10 ContributorsMindreader Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're like a bittersweet harmony
And there never really was a you and me
You wrapped me 'round your finger
Then hit my back with your deadly stinger

[Pre-Chorus]
Save myself
You'll be the death of me
Save myself
Stay away from me
Save myself
I want you out of my head so bad

[Chorus]
And even if I wanna hide what I'm feeling for you
You'd figure it out 'cause
You're a mindreader
And even if I wanna hide what I'm feeling for you
You'd figure it out 'cause
You're a mindreadеr

[Verse 2]
All the goddamn time, you made mе feel like shit
The only thing you really cared about was your benefit
I wanna get out while you're tryna get in sucka
Everything you did is something I'll do better
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Save yourself
Oh, I will beat you up
Save yourself
I know you'd never stop
Save yourself
I'm gonna make you regret so bad

[Chorus]
And even if I wanna hide what I'm feeling for you
You'd figure it out 'cause
You're a mindreader
And even if I wanna hide what I'm feeling for you
You'd figure it out 'cause
You're a mindreader
Mindreader

[Bridge]
Save myself
Yeah

[Breakdown]
You are the devil, bitch
Everybody knows that
I wanna cut my thoughts out of your head
You are the devil, bitch
Everybody knows that
When I'm done with you, you'd rather be dead
Dead, so dead
When I'm done with you, you'd rather be dead
Dead, so dead
When I'm done with you, you'd rather be dead
[Chorus]
And even if I wanna hide what I'm feeling for you
You'd figure it out 'cause
You're a mindreader
And even if I wanna hide what I'm feeling for you
You'd figure it out 'cause
You're a mindreader
Mindreader

[Outro]
I gotta move on but you hold me
You're still in my head you control me
'Cause you're a mindreader
I wanna be right here without you
Just wanna forget what I've been through
I need a mindreader
