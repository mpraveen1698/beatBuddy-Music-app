15 Contributorsâ€‹she likes spring, i prefer winter Lyrics[Verse]
Stay by the fire
You're giving looks like you're telling me I'm faded
It's cold outside (Cold outside)
But spring's in the corner and I'm waiting
On the way to work, she saw the flowers bloomin' up
Tellin' me how winter sucks for you
What more that I can do?
But we met this year last season
That's why it's so memorable for me
We've worked so hard to where we be
And that's enough for me right now

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've been dyin' to see
But you be that flower for me
I prefer marigold
But it's the lily from the valley that you want
What you've been dyin' to see
But you be that flower for me
I prefer marigold
But it's the lily from the valley that you want (Want)
But I'd be so glad if I'm havin' you
For this moment, yeah
For this moment, yeah, yeah

Girl, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, that's it
Don't let it hurt, let it hurt, let it hurt, nothing left to feel
Winter or spring, it don't matter to me
As long as you're here
I can keep you warm 'til spring comes
Yeah

[Bridge]
Jasmine marigold winters, oh yeah
Whichever blooms first, I might call you by that
Whatever you like
Daffodil or tulips, 'cause I really don't mind
If that makes you happy, then I'll be (I'll be)
Happy too (Happy too), oh
Jasmine marigold winters, oh yeah
Whichever blooms first, I might call you by that
Whatever you like
Daffodil or tulips, 'cause I really don't mind

[Chorus]
Girl, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, that's it
Don't let it hurt, let it hurt, let it hurt, nothing left to feel
Winter or spring, it don't matter to me
As long as you're here
I can keep you warm 'til spring comes (Ohh-oh)
Girl, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, that's it
Don't let it hurt, let it hurt, let it hurt, nothing left to feel (Feel)
Winter or spring it don't matter to me (To me)
As long as you're here
I can keep you warm 'til spring comes
