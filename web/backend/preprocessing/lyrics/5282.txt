Why you standin' all by yourself?
Those shoes were made for dancin' with someone else
Why don't we move over to that empty space?
I'll bet you twenty bucks I'll put a smile on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
I know a place where we can

[Chorus]
Dance the night away
Baby, we can try to
Make the world spin slower
We can take our time
And get to know each other over cherry wine

[Verse 2]
Well, it's too soon to give up on tonight, oh
I haven't had the chance to show you my moves and I
I think you'd like to see why they would call me Mr. Dynamite

[Chorus]
I can show you while we dance the night away
Baby, we can try to
Make the world spin slower
We can take our time
And get to know each other over cherry wine
I've been waitin' on this dance floor
Made for two
Won't you show me just what you can do?
I don't wanna waste your time
So please just have me for tonight?
Dance

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said, "Let's dance the night away"
Baby, we can try to
Make the world spin slower
We can take our time
And get to know each other over cherry wine
Oh, I, dance the night away
Baby, we can try to
Make the world spin slower
We can take our time

[Outro]
I know it's too soon to say, "You're mine"
But let's have a little drink tonight
And get to know each other over cherry wine9Embed Cherry Wine Cherry Wine grentperez chill
