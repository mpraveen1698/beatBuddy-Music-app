91 ContributorsThere For You Lyrics[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
I woke up pissed off today
And lately, everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too

[Breakdown: Troye Sivan]
But you gotta be there for me too

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

[Bridge: Troye Sivan]
I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

[Breakdown: Troye Sivan]
But you gotta be there for me too

[Bridge: Troye Sivan]
Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Said I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
But you gotta be there for me too
[Breakdown: Troye Sivan]
But you gotta be there for me too54Embed There for You There for You Martin Garrix;Troye Sivan edm
