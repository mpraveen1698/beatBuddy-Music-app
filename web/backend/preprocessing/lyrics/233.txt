Mount Everest ain't got shit on me
Mount Everest ain't got shit on me
'Cause I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, yeah
Burj Dubai ain't got shit on me
You could touch the sky but you ain't got shit on me
'Cause I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, yeah

[Chorus]

(Tell 'em)
I burn down my house and build it up again
(Tell 'em)
I burn it down twice just for the fun of it
(Tell 'em)
So much money I don't know what to do with it
(Tell 'em)
I don't pick up my phone, ain't no one worth the time
(Tell 'em)
I got me one gun and an alibi
(Tell 'em)
So much love that the whole thing feel like a lie

[Bridge]
I don't need nobody (Ha)
I don't need nobody (Ah)
I don't need nobody
I don't need nobody (Ah)
I don't need nobody (No cap)
I don't need nobody
(To save me)
(So high, so high)
