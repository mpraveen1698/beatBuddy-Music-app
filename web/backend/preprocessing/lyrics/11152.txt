Here we go

[Verse 1]
Island breeze suh mi fresh enuh
Mek a one post and she wet enuh
Gyal, they a foot like crep enuh
Ex gyal a tell man fi settle dung, but anyhow
Thirty gyal a day cah man a chop
If yuh check di stats, then di Chopp dey a top
Yuh girl inna mi Snap and I mek di batty—
Pocket ever fat, enuh bricks
Dis a block full a strap, a nuh backpack
Cali Corner, my block
Cool pon it too, torture fi tapped
Keys like locks, traffic and trap
Money run top speed, sittin' like Flash, what's that? (What's that?)

[Chorus]
Stop gwaan like yuh nuh notice, yuh notice, gyal
Weh yuh wife gimme brain every time
Weh mi feel like, say mi need motives
Watch pon mi wrist, coldest
Rich cah mi live pon the line like clothes pin
She a say, "You bruk so how you boasy?"
Dung in her throat like say mi name "COVID"
Inna mi bag like groceries
Dawg, man, inna mi bag like book
Here we go, how mi look? (Ayy)
Tek them gyal, gyal thief, gyal crook
She a fall fi di image a di style a di look
She a Snap to mi song and a sing to di hook

Uptown gyal but she nuh gwaan stush
Suh she suck off mi cocky, dung throat mi a push
Yuh gyal a groupie but issa wife yah look
Yuh nuh see it so yuh fool, bredda, mind, you look stupid
Yuh gyal a call mi a say she wan' do tings
Yuh watch da pum but she gimme when yuh not looking
Swing e fast cah the Choppa good looking
And mi song dem hotter than di pot that she cooking
Say she love me, nuttin' mi cyaan do, still
Yuh cyaan get mi heart, baby, mi a nuh cupid
Top Choppa, wah you tek mi fi, rookie? (Ayy)

[Chorus]
Stop gwaan like yuh nuh notice, yuh notice, gyal
Weh yuh wife gimme brain every time
Weh mi feel like, say mi need motives
Watch pon mi wrist, coldest
Rich cah mi live pon the line like clothes pin
She a say, "You bruk so how you boasy?"
Dung in her throat like say mi name "COVID"
Inna mi bag like groceries
Dawg, man, inna mi bag like book
Here we go, how mi look? (Ayy)
Tek them gyal, gyal thief, gyal crook
She a fall fi di image a di style a di—
She a Snap to mi song and a sing to di—Embed Verified Choppa 2 Verified Choppa 2 Marksman j-dance
