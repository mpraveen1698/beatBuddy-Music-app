2 ContributorsDestiny (Cinematic Edit) LyricsTravelers on an unending voyage of discovery
A voyage fueled by desire to know our true calling
Seeking for timeless wisdom beneath the ever changing depths of heaven
Trapped in confusion
Armed with melodies to strike our emotions
Waging the war within
Until one day
Sooner or later we see
This music is our destiny

Sooner or later we see
This music is our destiny

As we walk through the valley in the shadow of death
Thy shall fear no evil
Headhunterz are back

Sooner or later we see
This music is our destiny
