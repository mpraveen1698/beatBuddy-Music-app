I'm still on your Netflix
Girl, I know you love me
Even though your parents
They don't fucking trust me
They probably all right though
I know I'm an asshole
No reply to all your texts, girl, I do you mad cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Like you're just
Dying to drive, but you can't find the keys
Not looking for God, but you're down on your knees
I'm all that you want, but not what you need, girl, why?

[Chorus]
Tell me why do you still love me
Why do you love me?
You know you shouldn't love me
Yeah, you still love me

[Verse 2]
All your friends tell you they hate me
God, I'm fuckin' shady
Couple weeks ago they were inside my sheets naked
Club, so you can Snapchat
Titties out to snap that
I know that you do that shit just hoping for a snap back
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Like you're just
Dying to drive, but you can't find the keys
Not looking for God, but you're down on your knees
I'm all that you want, but not what you need, girl, why?
(Girl, why?)

[Chorus]
Tell me why do you still love me
Why do you love me?
You know you shouldn't love me
Yeah, you still love me, oh

[Bridge]
Why do you need me when you know you don't need me?
It's tearing you apart
I leave you broken and shaken
And you still call me baby

[Chorus]
Tell me why do you still love me (Why you love me?)
Why do you love me? (Why you love me?)
You know you shouldn't love me (Yeah)
Yeah, you still love me (You still love me)35Embed Why COSMIC Bazzi electro
