Drop another snake bomb, it might shake
I confused it with an earthquake
Mass confusion in a mason jar
Texas blood flow in a biker bar
Stick to bluegrass guns
We are riding with the flying nuns
Tell me all the dirty things you have seen
Are you laced up? Well, are you really clean?

[Chorus]
I'ma lose it if I do not find, oh
Someone better reach out
Find a steady shine
Someone better reach out
Get it on the line
I’m a bruiser and I do not mind, oh
Someone better reach out
Climb a mountain time
Someone better reach out
Get it on the line

[Verse 2]
Cruising down the hill in a blue streetcar
Can't refuse it, no matter who you are
Filling up your head with a bathtub rose
We composed it, but does it really show?
Slow your donkeys down
This good lord is from a border town
I'm about to lose what little I’ve got
Please don't treat me like an afterthought

I'ma lose it if I do not find, oh
Someone better reach out
Find a steady shine
Someone better reach out
Get him on the line
I'm a bruiser and I do not mind, oh
Someone better reach out
Climb a mountain time
Someone better reach out
Get it on the line

[Bridge]
Feel my call the lexicon makes its
Own way, own way
Break this fall, the excellence has its
Own say, own say

[Verse 3]
Hazard pay for a canceled bear
Bygone Sally with the greasy hair
Hard as nails but soft to wear
Rooftop crops up, we'll have a folding chair
Pay your thug store hench
Mugshot daddy with a golden wrench
Locomotive smoke to cover up what's broke
Please don't seize me until you get my joke
[Chorus]
I'ma lose it if I do not find, uh
Someone better reach out
Find a steady shine
Someone better reach out
Get him on the line
I’m a bruiser and I do not mind, oh
Someone better reach out
Climb a mountain time
Someone better reach out
Get him on the line

[Outro]
I’ma lose it if I do not find, oh
Someone better reach out
Find a steady shine
Someone better reach out
Get him on the line3Embed Reach Out Return of the Dream Canteen Red Hot Chili Peppers metal
