26 ContributorsEvery Time You Leave Lyrics[Verse 1: Brian Burkheiser]
All I ever wanted was to find someone
But holdin' it together is the hardest part
No one said life gets in the way
That our plans may change, but our hearts remain
You stand in the doorway holdin’ me
Feeling the tension, you beg and plead
Not to go away again
And then she said

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
"Every time you leave, I lose a little piece of me"
And every time we speak, words don't do it justice
It's just us from here, here
And that’s when she said
"Every time you leave, I lose a little piece of me"

[Verse 2: Delaney Jane]
All I ever wanted was to find someone
But finishing the puzzle is the hardest part
Every day wishin' you could stay
'Cause our minds may change, but our hearts remain
You stand in the doorway holding me
Lost in the moment, I can't believe
You gotta go away again
Hear me when I say

"Every time you leave, I lose a little piece of me"
And every time we speak, words don't do it justice
It's just us from here, here
And that's when she said
"Every time you leave, I lose a little piece of me"

[Post-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser and Delaney Jane]
'Cause if you ever start to hesitate
And you feel the weight, it starts to break
We’re not the same
Know that this means everything to me
Oh, to me, oh, to me, oh, to me, oh, to me

[Bridge: Brian Burkheiser and Delaney Jane]
Every time you leave, I lose a little piece of me
And every time we speak, words don’t do it justice

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
Every time you leave, I lose a little piece of me
And every time we speak, words don't do it justice
It’s just us from here
Here, here
And that's when she said
Every time you leave, I lose a little piece of me
[Outro: Brian Burkheiser and Delaney Jane]
All I ever wanted was to find someone
But finishing the puzzle is the hardest part
(I lose a little piece of me)
No one said life gets in the way
It's just us from here
Here (I lose a little piece of me)
Here, I lose a little piece of me5Embed Every Time You Leave TRAUMA I Prevail;Delaney Jane metalcore
