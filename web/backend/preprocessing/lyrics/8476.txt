5 ContributorsHeavenly Lyrics[Verse 1]
I love the sound of your voice
On the back of my neck when we're tangled up in each other
(Tangled up in each other, yeah)
And I love the nights we spend
Where the hours blend and we're still hidden under the covers
(Yeah)
I must be dreaming

[Chorus]
Heavenly, you are my remedy
I want you to bury me in your reverie

[Verse 2]
I couldn't have planned for this
Falling for you the way I did
Yeah, it's tantric, romantic, it's heaven to me
I'm anchored to every word that you speak

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think I'll ever find another who could make me feel this good, this good
And I don't ever wanna have to spend another night here without you, without you

[Chorus]
Heavenly, you are my remedy
I want you to bury me in your reverie
Heavenly, you are my remedy
I want you to bury me in your reve-, your reverie

Don't mean to sound pathetic
But I finally get it
Don't mean to sound so desperate
But you are my heaven
You are my heaven

[Chorus]
Heavenly, you are my remedy
I want you to bury me in your reverie
Heavenly, you are my remedy
I want you to bury me in your reve-, your reverie
In your reverieEmbed Heavenly Into the Raging Sea Broadside emo
