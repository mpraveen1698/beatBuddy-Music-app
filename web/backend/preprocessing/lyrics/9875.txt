I will now proceed to entangle the entire area
[Verse 1]
Almost cut my hair
It happened just the other day
It was gettin' kinda long
I could-a said, it was in my way
But I didn't and I wonder why
I feel like letting my freak flag fly
Yes I feel like I owe it to someone

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Must be because I had the flu for Christmas
And I'm not feelin' up to par
It increases my paranoia
Like lookin' at my mirror and seein' a police car
But I'm not givin' in an inch to fear
'Cause I promised myself this year
I feel like I owe it to someone

[Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
When I finally get myself together
I'm gonna get down in that sunny southern weather
And I find a place inside to laugh
Separate the wheat from the chaff
I feel like I owe it to someoneYou might also like5Embed Almost Cut My Hair Deja Vu Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young psych-rock
