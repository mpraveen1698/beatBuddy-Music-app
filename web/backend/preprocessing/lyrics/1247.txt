You don't look like in your photo
You're prettier than that
Now I kinda wish that you said so
Would've put in more effort

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, I hope you call me, call me
'Cause I know I won't let you down
And I hope you believe, believe
I'll be here for you, here for you

[Chorus]
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
When I think about you, thе world go less blue
Let's do it ovеr again
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world go less blue
Let's do it over again
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'll go on all your adventures
If you wanna find yourself
I've been to so many places
But I've never felt better

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, I hope you call me, call me
'Cause I know I won't let you down
Man, I hope you believe this
I'll be here for you, here for you

[Chorus]
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world go less blue
Let's do it over again
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world go less blue
Let's do it over again (It works)
