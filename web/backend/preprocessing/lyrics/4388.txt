24 ContributorsSexy Drug Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sexy girl, I just fell in love
You should try it, it's a hell of a drug
Like OMG, you make me com-com-complete
I'm looking for reasons, I'm begging and pleading
I'm dreaming of calling you mine
You keep me stu-stu-stuttering, stumbling
Fumbling over my lines
Without you, girl, I'm not alright
I'm not okay, yeah

[Chorus]
No, don't give up on me
Wait, it's not what it seems
Now we can't stop this tragedy
And it's back to the start, yeah, yeah
And we're falling apart, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Sexy girl, come and lay with me
I'm frustrated, and it's sexually
Like OMG, you make me com-com-complete
I'm just being honest, I'm creeping and crawling
I'm kissing the top of your head
We're rocking and rolling, we're touching and moaning
And making a mess of your bed
Can someone help? She shot me dead
I can't be saved, yeah

No, don't give up on me
Wait, it's not what it seems

[Bridge]
So, God, if you are real, I need your help
Because this girl has stolen my heart with her broken halo
And I can't deny, she's so damn fine
Give me some advice

[Interlude]
Sexy girl, I just fell in love
You should try it, it's a hell of a drug
Like OMG, you make me com-com-complete

[Chorus]
No, don't give up on me, wait, it's not what it seems
Now we can't stop this tragedy
No, don't give up on me, wait, it's not what it seems
Now we can't stop this tragedy
And it's back to the start, yeah, yeah
And we're falling apart, yeah, yeah
And it's back to the start, yeah, yeah
And we're falling apart, yeah, yeah
