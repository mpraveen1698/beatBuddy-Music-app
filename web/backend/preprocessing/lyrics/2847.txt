They say 'Freak'
When you're singled out
The red
Well, it filters through

[Chorus]
So lay down, the threat is real
When his sight goes red again

[Post-Chorus]
Seeing red again
Seeing red again

[Verse 2]
This change
He won't contain
Slip away
To clear your mind

[Verse 3]
When asked
Who made it show (Made it show)
The truth
He gives in to most

So lay down, the threat is real
When his sight goes red again

When his sight goes red again

Seeing red again, seeing red again
Seeing red again, seeing red again
Seeing red again, seeing red again
Seeing red again, seeing red!
