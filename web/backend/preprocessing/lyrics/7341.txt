18 ContributorsLet Me Hear Lyrics[Chorus]
You guys do not notice that we
Are gifted just by being humans
We are absolute predators
We do not even have any enemies
Maybe there are other animals watching us
And thinking that "someday we will beat them down"

[Verse 1]
Oh, we have the brains to think hard
Wear our favorite clothes
We are at no doubt human beings many small lives
They were born (they were born) With the fate (with the fate)
Of dying for someone (for someone a human baby)
A human baby, when will they find out
(When will they find out the true fact, yeah)

[Refrain]
That at the point they were born, we are (we are winners)
(The) winners of Earth
ああ、一人泣いていた隣の君が問いかける
だから僕ら寄り添い生きるきらめくまで

[Breakdown]
For what have I been living for?
When will I find out the answer?
An answer that is only for you
What will myself and (the) first scenery I saw look like?
It's my face, my face
You might also like[Verse 2]
Shut up! I read this inside
The book I read before (the book I read before)
According (to) Maslow (according (to) Maslow)
There are five steps (in a) human's desire
To live a long long life to stay safe and to receive
(Baby)
Love from others
To get respect from (Baby) others, to get closer (Yeah)
To your ideal (Yeah) That's what it said (Yeah)
No matter how hard other animals try
They probably can't go over the first step
That is how intelligent we are and, (an animal) filled with greed
But that is probably why we can still live
On the top of the food chain
In this blue planet although we have weak bodies

[Bridge]
ああ、また君の目にいつもの朝が映り込む
流れる涙が消えてゆく

[Refrain]
For what to live for think deeply as you live, yeah
'Cause you humans are (the) only ones that can do this on Earth
新しい答えを
What is it that you want to get in your right hands?
Let me hear
[Outro]
Tell me your new answer
Prove that you are different from monkeys
If there is nothing to crave for, humans will die in a way
Don't you think so too?
Let me hear, let me hear, let me hear5Embed Let Me Hear Feeling of Unity Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas metal
