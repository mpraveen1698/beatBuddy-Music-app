All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man, I'm sure
When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

[Chorus]
But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody
Like you, oh, oh, oh
Like you, like you

[Verse 2]
So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

[Chorus]
But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody

[Chorus]
If you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody
