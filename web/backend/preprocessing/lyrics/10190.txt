[Verse 1]
And it go 1, 2, 3, 4
How many times can I fall in love in a night
I don't know (I don't)
No, No
She wanna be with a lowlife rapper
Yeah I'm pretty good at singing too
I can keep you right in tune
We could fall in love right after
Ay wassup, wassup, what's the
And what's the difference between youthful and childish
Between you and I, this is perfect timing
Just rewind yeah just rewind yeah
I'm having trouble can you remind me

[Verse 2]
And it go 5, 6, 7, 8
How many times can we hold this gaze
Without falling deeper in this trance
Just grab my hand and spin around and fall back yeah
She wanna live like a rockstar (aye)
Want a supercar ever since the Hotwheels
She want the Louis Vuitton, she already got heels
The list go on and on got a lot to offer
And
Let the rhythm push you in the right direction
You're my type no second guessing
I'm alright, cool, calm, collected
Promise I won't bite unless
You want to get aggressive
So what if this was fate
What if right here, right now
We were meant to be together
Meet each other in this place
I cannot hear, it's too loud
We should get to know each other
Maybe just to be safe
And it would be great if you could explain (yeah)
If you could explain
[Chorus]
Who taught ya how to move like that
Throw it back, you my old school crush
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I really wish I knew you back
Before I knew too much
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)6Embed Crush B.L.I.S.S. Souly Had chill
