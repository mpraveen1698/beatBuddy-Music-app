15 ContributorsFor the Glory Lyrics[Verse 1]
Better back down, you're in my domain
Got the whole crowd screaming out our name
It's a blowout, it's a hurricane
It's over before you know it
Why you shaking? We're a dynasty
In the making, we're the royalty
Now we're breaking down the enemy
Move over for the soldiers

[Pre-Chorus]
Take a swing, I can take a hit
If we die, it's fine, we live for this
It's all for this

[Chorus]
We're gonna stand on top with our hands in the sky
Gonna raise our cup to the stadium lights
For the glory, for the glory
For the glory, for the glory
We celebrate with the city tonight
Hear the hometown cheer, it's the ultimate high
For the glory, for the glory
We do it for the glory, for the glory

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we've waited for our time to come
Calculated everything we've done
We've upgraded, now you can't outrun
A champion, now you're facing one
Can you hear them? Yeah, it's all for us
You believe them? Yeah, it's serious
Hear the siren? We're victorious
I'm telling ya, can I get a hell yeah?

Take a swing, I can take a hit
If we die, it's fine, we live for this

[Chorus]
We're gonna stand on top with our hands in the sky
Gonna raise our cup to the stadium lights
For the glory, for the glory
For the glory, for the glory
We celebrate with the city tonight
Hear the hometown cheer, it's the ultimate high
For the glory, for the glory
We do it for the glory, for the glory

[Verse 3]
You're the chaser, I'm the eraser
I'll ruin your record, I'm back here to break ya
I cut like a razor, so call the trophy engraver
I'm gonna get it, wait till I win it
God, I'm so glad to be in it
Can't wait to say that we did it
This is my life, and I live it
Ready to give it my all when you fall back
Taking advantage of all that
Game is on average, you're so bad
Playing shorthanded, your team scratched
Time to assess all the damages
I knew that you couldn't handle this
It takes a man to stand up to the king
And unfortunately, you're in bandages
[Chorus]
We're gonna stand on top with our hands in the sky
Gonna raise our cup to the stadium lights
For the glory, for the glory
For the glory, for the glory
We celebrate with the city tonight
Hear the hometown cheer, it's the ultimate high
For the glory, for the glory
We do it for the glory, for the glory

[Outro]
This is why we do it
This is what we live for
We're on top, we're number one
Hands to the sky
Never back down
Never back down
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name6Embed For the Glory Machines All Good Things blues
