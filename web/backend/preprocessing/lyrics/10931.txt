2 ContributorsBest Thing Lyrics[Chorus]
I know we said this won’t be the way we stay forever
I want you in my life that won’t change if we’re not together
Even if you’re not the one I see down the aisle
You’re the best thing
You’re the best thing
That’s happened to me in a while

[Verse 1]
I was in the dark but you held up a light
Became my best friend who shares my bed some nights
Handed me the map to help me find myself
Made sure that I know I don’t need no one else

[Refrain]
I was in a cycle of pain that was disguised as love
I didn’t know what I could know, you made me feel enough
There ain’t no title that can match our vibe
But whatever we call it just know you changed my life

[Chorus]
I know we said this won’t be the way we stay forever
I want you in my life that won’t change if we’re not together
Even if you’re not the one I see down the aisle
You’re the best thing
You’re the best thing
That’s happened to me in a while

You always have my back I know you love to watch it
When I want the truth I know you always got it
You’re like my soulmate from another lifetime
I’ve been showing you your value you’ve been teaching me mine

[Refrain]
'Cause, I was in a cycle of pain that was disguised as love
I didn’t know what I could know, you made me feel enough
There ain’t no title that can match our vibe
But whatever we call it just know you changed my life

[Chorus]
I know we said this won’t be the way we stay forever
I want you in my life that won’t change if we’re not together
Even if you’re not the one I see down the aisle
You’re the best thing
You’re the best thing
That’s happened to me in a while

[Bridge]
And if we ain’t meant to be together forever
You’re still the best thing
You’re still the best thing
And if we ain’t meant to be together forever
You’re still the best thing
You’re still the best thing
To happen to me in a while
Happen to me in a while
[Outro]
You’re still the best thing
My best friend
