(Oh) Turn up the music, let's get out on the floor
I like to move it, come and give me some more
Watch me getting physical, out of control (Ah-ah)
There's people watching me (Ah-ah), I never miss a beat

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie Horler]
Steal the night, kill the lights, feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight 'cause it's pulling you in
Wrap it up, you can't stop 'cause it feels like an overdose
(Feels like an overdose, like an overdose)

[Chorus: Natalie Horler & (Carlprit)]
Oh, oh, evacuate the dance floor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ, let the music take me underground
(Everybody in the club)
Oh, oh, evacuate the dance floor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club)
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ, come burn this place right down to the ground

[Verse 2: Natalie Horler]
(Oh) My body's aching, system overload (Overload)
Temperature's rising, I'm about to explode
Watch me, I'm intoxicated, take in the show (Ah-ah)
It's got me hypnotized (Ah-ah), everybody step aside

[Post-Chorus: Carlprit]
Come on and evacuate, feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate, push it to the top
Come on and evacuate, feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate, you don't have to be afraid

[Bridge: Carlprit]
Now guess who's back on a brand new track
That got everybody in the club goin' mad?
So everybody in the back
Get your back up off the wall and just shake that thang
Go crazy, yo, lady, yo, baby
Let me see you wreck that thang
Now drop it down low, low
Let me see you take it to the dance floor, yo
[Chorus: Natalie Horler & (Carlprit)]
(Everybody in the club) Evacuate the dance floor

Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
