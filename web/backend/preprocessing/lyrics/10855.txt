16 Contributorsâ€‹worthless Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm always so alone
Even when surrounded
By people that I know
I'm always so astounded
By my ability to ruin everything
Losing friends and starting fires
Everyone thinks I'm a liar
I always stay at home
'Cause I'm not good in public
I sit here on my phone
I'm always disappointed
I watch them live their lives
I wish that I were happy
Victim of my generation
Time machines cannot erase it

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am I supposed to be?
When will I be complete?
When will they be proud of me?
It's getting harder to see

[Chorus]
Slit my wrists, bloody fists
Questioning why I exist
Pain persists, evil gifts
Fucking up my life to shit
I'm worthless, I'm worthless
I'm worthless, slit my wrists until I bleed out

I try to stay strong
No matter what I do
I'm always in the wrong
It never gets easier
But maybe that's the point
It's part of growing up
Messing up and learning from it
That's just life, it's necessary
Clinging to hope
What else is there to live for?
Got nowhere to go
What else is pain good for?
I am confident that your life has a purpose
It's okay, you will get through it
Don't give up 'cause someone needs you

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am I supposed to be?
When will I be complete?
When will they be proud of me?
It's getting harder to see

[Chorus]
Slit my wrists, bloody fists
Questioning why I exist
Pain persists, evil gifts
Fucking up my life to shit
I'm worthless, I'm worthless
I'm worthless, slit my wrists until I bleed out
[Bridge]
Please, don't give up
Gotta stay strong, gotta move on
Gotta know hope when you feel low
Please, you gotta know
That someone needs you
Please, don't give up
Gotta stay strong, gotta move on
Gotta know hope when you feel low
Please, you gotta know
That someone needs you

[Chorus]
Slit my wrists, bloody fists
Questioning why I exist
Pain persists, evil gifts
Fucking up my life to shit
I'm worthless, I'm worthless
I'm worthless, slit my wrists until I bleed out
Worthless, I'm worthless
I'm worthless, slit my wrists until I bleed out9Embed worthless the way we used to love. eli. sad
