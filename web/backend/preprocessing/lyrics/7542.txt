You're hurtin’ so much
I need you to breathe again
You have been hurtin' so much
I need you to breathe again

[Verse 1]
Skin unfolding
Come in, my friend
You feel unsteady
But I won't bend

[Chorus]
You’re hurtin' so much
I need you to breathe again
You have been hurtin' so much
I need you to breathe again

[Verse 2]
Reach in, go deeper
You will feel no pain
In the sweet surrender
Alive once again

[Chorus]
You're hurtin' so much
I need you to breathe again
You have been hurtin' so much
I need you to breathe again
You're hurtin' so much
I need you to breathe again
You have been hurtin’ so much
I need you to breathe again
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You’re hurtin' so much
I need you to breathe again
You have been hurtin’ so much
I need you to breathe again2Embed Breathe Breathe CamelPhat;Cristoph;Jem Cooke progressive-house
