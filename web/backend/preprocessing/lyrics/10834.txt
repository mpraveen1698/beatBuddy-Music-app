6 ContributorsColder Heavens Lyrics[Verse 1]
In every corridor that shifted the maze
No single part of you was ever the same
Now we're so tired by the things we have seen
All we've forgotten only visits in dreams
How I misunderstood
Here I stand undressed
Here I confess my doubt
Did you know that I would?
From this fractured lens
We're unveiled again and again

[Chorus]
Sometimes I get the feeling I'm lost
Just hiding it is never enough
Now I find in every mirror a ghost
Only once I saw the killer
Once I saw the killer up close

[Verse 2]
Heaven's over now, I know it's gone
I know it's over now if colder heavens come
Carry me further down where our madness rests
Where I'll have less to doubt
All I misunderstood, my abandoned friend
Our parade has already left
You might also like[Chorus]
Sometimes I get the feeling I'm lost
Just hiding it is never enough
Now I find in every mirror a ghost
Only once I saw the killer
Once I saw the killer up close

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Sometimes I get the feeling I'm lost
Just hiding it is never enough
Now I find in every mirror a ghost
Only once I saw the killer
Once I saw the killer up close

[Outro]
Heaven's over now, gone away
Heaven's over now, gone away
Away...
Away...Embed Colder Heavens Colder Heavens EP Blanco White british
