25 ContributorsIn the Waiting Line Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wait in line
Till your time
Ticking clock
Everyone stop

[Refrain]
'Cause everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you believe
In what you see?
There doesn't seem to be
Anybody else who agrees with me

[Chorus]
Do you believe
In what you see?
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Wasting my time
In the waiting line
Do you believe
In what you see?

Nine to five
Living lies
Every day
Stealing time

[Refrain]
Everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can
Everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you believe
In what you feel?
There doesn't seem to be
Anybody else who agrees with me

[Chorus]
Do you believe
In what you see?
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Wasting my time
In the waiting line
Do you believe in
In what you see?
[Bridge]
And I'll shout and I'll scream
But I'd rather not be seen
And I'll hide away
For another day

[Chorus]
Do you believe
In what you see?
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Wasting my time
In the waiting line
Do you believe in
In what you see?

[Outro]
'Cause everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
'Cause everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can
And everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can
And everyone's saying different things to me
