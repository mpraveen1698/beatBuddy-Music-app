2 ContributorsEyes Blue Or Brown, Canâ€™t Remember Lyrics[Chorus]
Eyes blue or brown, can't remember
Lot of time has passed since 3rd of December
Eyes green or grey, can't remember
But I bet you know the colour of Heather's

[Verse]
Getting cold, but I have my own sweater
Fuck your polyester 'cause cotton's way better
You were playin' Jack and Rose
When you sunk, only you froze
'Cause you gave her your sweater
You're lost in Atlantic, tryin' not to panic
But now it's too late to come back
Moved on and I'm better
Know my worth, I'm Heather
Not taken for granted

[Chorus]
Eyes blue or brown, can't remember
Lot of time has passed since 3rd of December
Eyes green or grey, can't remember
But I bet you know the colour of Heather's
Eyes blue or brown, can't remember
Lot of time has passed since 3rd of December
Eyes green or grey, can't remember
But I bet you know the colour of Heather's
Eyes blue or brown, can't remember
Lot of time has passed since 3rd of December
Eyes green or grey, can't remember
But I bet you know the colour of Heather's
Eyes blue or brown, can't remember
Lot of time has passed since 3rd of December
Eyes green or grey, can't remember
But I bet you know the colour of Heather's
Eyes blue or brown, can't remember
Lot of time has passed since 3rd of December
Eyes green or grey, can't remember
But I bet you know the colour of Heather's
