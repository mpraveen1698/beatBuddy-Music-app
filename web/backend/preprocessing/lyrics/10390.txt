6 ContributorsLetting Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
We can say what we say
We can go one more day
We can try but it's all the same
Hold on to could have beens
With the salt on our chins
We can try but it's all the same

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I-I, I don't wanna waste my time
But I still love the taste of our bittersweet
No, I-I, I don't wanna waste your time
When we can't make our hearts skip beats

[Chorus]
When you feel like letting go but you're holding on
When you feel like letting go 'cause the love is gone
When you feel like letting go
Yeah, we can try and try
But with no more tears to cry
You know
When you feel like letting go but you're holding on
When you feel like letting go 'cause the love is gone
When you feel like letting go
Yeah, we can try and try
But with no more tears to cry
You know
When you feel like letting go
When you feel like letting go

Used to stay up all night
Talking in to the light
Now we ran out of words to say
All the reasons to let go
Repeats like an echo
We only need one to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I-I, I don't wanna waste my time
But I still love the taste of our bittersweet
No, I-I, I don't wanna waste your time
When we can't make our hearts skip beats

[Chorus]
When you feel like letting go but you're holding on
When you feel like letting go 'cause the love is gone
When you feel like letting go
Yeah, we can try and try
But with no more tears to cry
You know
When you feel like letting go but you're holding on
When you feel like letting go 'cause the love is gone
When you feel like letting go
Yeah, we can try and try
But with no more tears to cry
You know
When you feel like letting go
When you feel like letting go
[Chorus]
When you feel like letting go but you're holding on
When you feel like letting go 'cause the love is gone
When you feel like letting go
Yeah, we can try and try
But with no more tears to cry
You know
When you feel like letting goEmbed Letting Go Letting Go Hogland;KIDDO deep-house
