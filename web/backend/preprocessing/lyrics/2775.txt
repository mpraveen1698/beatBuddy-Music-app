I know what to do (Do)
Then come back for you (You)
I know what to do (Do)
Then come back for you (You)
I know what to do (Do)
Then come back for you (You)
(I come back for you)

[Chorus]
When you asked me for some more, I was energised
Couldn't see your eyes, they were up inside
When you asked if I could see, I was pulverised
Sat in overdrive, test and recognise

[Verse 2]
I know what to do (Do)
Then come back for you (You)
I know what to do (Do)
Then come back for you (You)
I know what to do (Do)
Then come back for you (You)

[Chorus]
When you asked me for some more, I was energised
Couldn't see your eyes, they were up inside
When you asked if I could see, I was pulverised
Sat in overdrive, test and recognise
When you asked me for some more, I was energised
Couldn't see your eyes, they were up inside
When you asked if I could see, I was pulverised
Sat in overdrive, test and recognise
When you asked me for some more, I was energised
Couldn't see your eyes, they were up inside
When you asked if I could see, I was pulverised
Sat in overdrive, test and recognise
