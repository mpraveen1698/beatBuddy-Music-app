10 ContributorsRamen Waitress LyricsYour taste is strong
I want it all
You're so delightful
I want a mouthful
Call me a creep
You're all I eat
Just the one for me
My little treat
You keep me warm
Please give me more
Your shiny hair
Keeps me in a stare
I get depressed
When I get dressed
Wish you were here
I feel empty, dearYou might also like1Embed Ramen Waitress Hopeless Romantic High Sunn garage
