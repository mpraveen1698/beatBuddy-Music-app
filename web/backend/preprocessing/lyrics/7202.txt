Stay a little longer
I feel your body
But youʼre out of touch

Donʼt say the words (no)
Just let me have this
Cause you only love me
When the lights go

Down down down down
You only love me when the lights go
Down down down down
You only love me when the lights go

Down down down down
Down down down down
You only love me when the lights go
Down down down down
Down down down down

Letʼs take our time
We are no runaways
But I can keep you save
I donʼt mind
If Iʼm part of the game you play (mh)
You might also likeDonʼt wake me up (no)
Better keep my eyes closed
I canʼt stand to see you fading out

Donʼt say the words (no)
Just lеt me have this
Cause you only lovе me when the lights go

Down down down down
You only love me when the lights go
Down down down down
You only love me when the lights go

Down down down down
Down down down down
You only love me when the lights go
Down down down down
Down down down down

You only love me when the lights go downEmbed Lights Go Down Lights Go Down Meynberg;Joseph Feinstein deep-house
