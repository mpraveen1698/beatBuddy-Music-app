5 ContributorsMe & Magdalena Lyrics[Verse 1]
Me and Magdalena
We're driving south through Monterey
As the sun is slowly sinking
Into a distant ocean wave

[Chorus]
And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she's under

[Verse 2]
Tell me, Magdalena
What do you see in the depths of your night?
Do you see a long-lost father?
Does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child?

[Chorus]
But know everything lost will be recovered
When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered
And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she's under

[Bridge]
Me and Magdalena
Always leaving early and sleeping late
Secluded in the canyon
Lost within a turn of fate
You might also like[Chorus]
But know everything lost will be recovered
When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered
And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she's under1Embed Me & Magdalena Good Times! (Deluxe Edition) The Monkees psych-rock
