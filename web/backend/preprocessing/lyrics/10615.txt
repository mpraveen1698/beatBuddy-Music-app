I'm lost and, I'm lost and
I'm lost and, I'm lost and
We lost in, emotion
I'm sorry, unspoken
Stop talking, explosion
Make up sex, so broken
Don't leave me, don't leave me
I know you, you need me
I know I'm not that easy, but babe, I'm on my knees
So lost that we can't see
I want you next to me
You wanna see me bleed
You wanna hear me scream

[Pre-Chorus]
So loud, but no sound
We fall down, we fall down

[Chorus]
On and off, and off and on
Can we talk, what's goin' on?
When we stop, we never stop
It's every day, every day (Yeah)
On and off, and off and on
Can we talk, what's goin' on?
When we stop, we never stop
It's every day, every day (Yeah)

Careful, slowly, darling, what's the hurry?
Love me, hate me, kiss me when you hurt me
Dancin' when we're burning
Every day, she learning
Ways to cut my heart into the shape she wants to turn me
Baby, that's a no-no
How low can you go, go?
Stick around to find how bad she'll wreck my fuckin' heart though

[Pre-Chorus]
So loud, but no sound
We fall down, we fall down

[Chorus]
On and off, and off and on
Can we talk, what's goin' on? (Hey!)
When we stop, we never stop
It's every day, every day (Yeah)
On and off, and off and on
Can we talk, what's goin' on?
When we stop, we never stop
It's every day, every day (Yeah)3Embed onoffonoff onoffonoff keshi chill
