You wanna be my baby?
Wanna be, you wanna be my baby?
Wanna be, you wanna be my baby?
Wanna be, you wanna be my baby?
Wanna be, you wanna be my baby?

[Verse 1: John Concepcion]
The way your body feels on mine
The way the chills creep up your spine
Ain't tryna ask but you’ll be mine
We moving fast
Can we just slow down the time?
Tell me how does it feel (yeah)
When I kiss you where you like it
You got me falling for you baby girl
I know you'll fall in love
Addicted like a drug (drug)
You falling for a thug (na)
Girl, you know what's up

[Pre Chorus: John Concepcion]
Baby, you’re a dream
So baby let me show you what I mean
And if you let me, follow your routine
Then ain't nobody do it like we do
You might also like[Chorus; John Concepcion]
Don't be so cautious
I'll be the one to tell you you're gorgeous
Want you to be my center of focus
Need you to be mine (mine, mine)
Girl, you so fine
Girl, you should come over here sometime
You know my line
Baby, just my hit my line

[Verse 2: Vinsint]
I gasp for air
As I watch that booty fall
This shit ain't fair
You are mine booty fine
Call me crazy
I got a dirty question baby
Baby, I ain't tryna waste your time but
Can I hit it from behind?
And I be talking my shit lately, come on
Just wanna make you horny, listen
I'mma make you my baby, yeah
Think that I’m frontin’ and
Think that I'm playing
But all that I’m saying's
For you (for you, you, you)
For you
[Chorus: John Concepcion]
Don't be so cautious
I'll be the one to tell you you’re gorgeous
Want you to be my center of focus
Need you to be mine (mine, mine)
Girl, you so fine
Girl, you should come over here sometime
You know my line
Baby, just my hit my line

[Outro: Vinsint & Concepcion]
Don't be so cautious

That pussy be my center of focus
Need you to be mine (mine, mine)
