Kolo (I want to use my last card)
I want to use my last card, oh (Kolo)
Ice Prince Zamani, yeah
Oxlade (Kolo)

[Verse 1: Oxlade]
My pastors been dey warn me
I been think say you dey one for me
I got you, but I'm down for this
But you don't know I'm the one for you
Those cases I reminisce
Many-many things wey you do for me
Many things wey you do for me

[Chorus: Oxlade]
(Kolo) I want to use my last card to spoil your life, oh
(Kolo) I want to go market, tear my shirt dey shout I love you
(Kolo) E get the things wey you dey do me I no fit explain, oh
(Kolo) Baby, you make me kolo, eh, eh, kolo, kolo

[Verse 2: Ice Prince]
Uh, I've been out here thinking
I've been smokin' and overdosе drinkin'
Tryna make you queen and a wife
My macaroni with cheese on a sidе
Hello, hey shawty, nice to meet ya
I gats make money, spoil you and your sister
Make I send ram to your mama for Easter
I no fit whine you mama, you no be lister
Girl, you make a man go nuts
The way you set with your chest and butt
Damn, you make a man go
I'ma let Oxlade do the rest of the talk

[Verse 3: Ice Prince]
E get e something you dey do me
Me I wanna love you truly
Just like a scene from a movie
I'll be like a Romeo to your Julie
Baby girl check this (Check this)
I'll be on you IG (IG)
But never call never text shit
I don't do the DM's, tagging and all that (Nah)
But every time you drop me a text I'ma call back
I'll be right there next to you, in real life
Treat you like a queen, my Nubian still nice (Ice)
I don't see nobody, you're the one I will wife
Come rain, come sun, come fire, come ice
