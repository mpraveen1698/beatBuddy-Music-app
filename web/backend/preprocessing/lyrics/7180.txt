You say I'm trip-trippin', but it's something always in the way
Same shit I'm dealin' with, just on a different day (Oh)
But I always end up right here with you, you
Oh, now I'm big trippin' 'cause you got me caught up in the chase (Oh)
Took it all from me, got nothing left to give away
Know I always end up findin' the truth, truth

[Verse]
Why you gotta go and make shit so complicated
Put the blame on me 'cause you knew that I was gon' tolerate it
I can't carry it all for you
I'm trying but you fumble it all
Try to keep it low key
Guess that's how it's gon' be
When you finally gon' see
Don't you put this on me, yeah
If I'm trippin', send me your location
I'll be waitin', boy, don't test my patience
Đừng nói anh yêu em, boy, if your fakin'
I've been thinking, all this timе I wasted
"Sorry," really don't mean shit at all

[Chorus]
You say I'm trip-trippin', but it's somеthing always in the way
Same shit I'm dealing with, just on a different day (Oh)
But I always end up right here with you, you
Oh, now I'm big trippin' 'cause you got me caught up in the chase (Oh)
Took it all from me, got nothing left to give away
Know I always end up findin' the truth, truth
