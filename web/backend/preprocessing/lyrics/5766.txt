26 ContributorsThe Wonder of You Lyrics[Verse 1]
When no one else can understand me
When everything I do is wrong
You give me hope and consolation
You give me strength to carry on

[Chorus]
And you're always there to lend a hand
In everything I do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you

[Verse 2]
And when you smile, the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king
Your kiss to me is worth a fortune
Your love for me is everything

[Chorus]
I'll guess I'll never know the reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you
Play it, James

[Chorus/Outro]
I'll guess I'll never know the reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder
The wonder of youYou might also like3Embed The Wonder of You The Essential Elvis Presley Elvis Presley rockabilly
