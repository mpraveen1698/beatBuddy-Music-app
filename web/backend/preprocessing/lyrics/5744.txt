13 ContributorsYou Don’t Want Me Anymore Lyrics[Intro]
Sometimes the truth hurts more than the lie (Teqkoi)
My feelings for you, they’ll never die
You say I’m perfect, then wouldn’t it be worth it to try again

[Chorus]
You’re going through shit, just don’t make excuses
You don’t want me anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore

[Verse]
And you say you love me but tell him you want him
You say you’re sorry but then go look for him
Got me so fucked up
You got me so fucked up

[Refrain]
And maybe if we met a different time
Things would be different now
Things would be different now
And maybe if we met at a different time
Things would be different now
Things would be different now10Embed You Don't Want Me Anymore You Don't Want Me Anymore Snøw;Teqkoi sad
