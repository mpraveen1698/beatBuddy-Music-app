When I'm with you, I don't wanna be with you

[Verse 1]
White hair and a hopeful smile
Your inside is on your outside
I need a pleasant surprise

[Pre-Chorus]
Good heart and desire to please
I want a fatal disease

[Chorus]
With you, I don't wanna be with you
When I'm with you, I don't wanna be with you

[Verse 2]
You are everything
My most demanding dream

[Pre-Chorus]
Good heart and desire to please
I want a fatal disease

[Chorus]
With you, I don't want to be with you
When I'm with you, I don't want to be with you
When I'm with you, I don't want to be with you
When I'm with you, I don't want to be with youYou might also like12Embed Covet Colourmeinkindness Basement hardcore
