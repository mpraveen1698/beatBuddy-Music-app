9 ContributorsYou Said Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, turn it up, Retro
Mm, yeah

[Chorus]
You said
"It's a little late for apologies"
Would never want me back
And now you're callin' me
It's a little late
But who am I to say
'Cause I would take you back
So what's it gonna be?

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Came back with that bouquet and apology note (Yeah)
Told me that it's too late, I should probably go (Yeah)
Drove home on that same road
Same one that you'd take home
The mornin' after you'd stay over
Hard to see it go (Yeah)
What you mean "it's over" why you walkin' out?
Made a few mistakes, I know, I'm sorry let's just talk it out
All I know is days are gettin' darker when you not around
Hundred times apologizing, isn't that enough?

But you said "It's a little late for apologies"
Would never want me back
And now you're callin' me
It's a little late
But who am I to say
'Cause I would take you back
So what's it gonna be? (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Heard that you were hangin' with another guy
Phone started ringing, heard your voice on the other side
Told me you were sorry that we ended things
And now you want me back so we can try a second thing
Hmm
So, you tellin' me that you spent time with another guy
To see the grass on the other side, was greener here
And you re-appear in my life, thinkin' I'd love to try
Wait
What about when I tried that?
You tell me you ain't like that
Got a brand new guy, got side tracked
Heart got broken and now you want mine back? (Ugh)
Why you comin' back the moment I decide to move on?
Playin' with my heart, you make it hard to know the truth, huh
Don't know what to do, 'cause honestly I'm missin' you
I haven't been the same since you went away, but I said
[Chorus]
It's a little late for apologies
Didn't want me back
And now you're calling me
It's a little late for apologies
'Cause you were never there
When you promised me

[Outro]
It's a little late for apologies
Didn't want me back
Stop calling me
It's a little late for apologies
And now the tables turned
So, I'm the one to leave2Embed You Said You Said Connor Price sad
