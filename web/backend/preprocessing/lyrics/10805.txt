1 ContributorNEXUS (PODv) Lyrics[Bridge]
The point of all
The fighting and trouble on the Earth
The nexus
You can't believe in what you hear
Point of all
The fighting and trouble on the earth
The nexus
You can't believe in what you hear

[Verse 1]
Never see the sun
Never be the same
I can see your tears inside
Torn up skies have killed the rain
Are we born to lose?
Should we even try?
Are we gonna gеt to choose
Who will live and who will die?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hatе
Blinding me, and your love
When you're talkin' about him
Sound just like a broke' record!
There's a reason why
Holdin' dirty secrets
Where you're gettin' your power
Sacrificin' my cousin!
What's it gonna be?
You might also like[Chorus]
Do I come from the fire?
We're going back, oh yeah!
So spend some time with me
I really like your company
We're not so different
Flip the coin it doesn't matter
And if we don't survive
I'd rather die than live a lie

[Verse 2]
Never see the bloom
Never see the game
I can see your tears inside
Hanging on the deepest pain
Yeah, we both are bruised
He's the reason why
Are we gonna let him choose?
We're connected you and I

[Pre-Chorus]
Hate
Blinding me, and your love
When you're talkin' about him
Sound just like a broke' record!
There's a reason why
Holdin' dirty secrets
Where you're gettin' your power
Sacrificin' my cousin!
What's it gonna be?
[Chorus]
Do I come from the fire?
We're going back, oh yeah!
So spend some time with me
I really like your company
We're not so different
Flip the coin it doesn't matter
And if we don't survive
I'd rather die than live a lie

[Bridge]
The point of all...
The point...
The nexus...
Point of all
The fighting and trouble on the earth
The nexus...
You...

[Chorus]
Do I come from the fire?
We're going back, oh yeah!
So spend some time with me
I really like your company
We're not so different
Flip the coin it doesn't matter
And if we don't survive
I'd rather die than live a lie
[Chorus]
Do I come from the fire?
We're going back, oh yeah!
So spend some time with me
I really like your company
We're not so different
Flip the coin it doesn't matter
And if we don't survive
I'd rather die than live a lie

[Outro]
The point of all
The fighting and trouble on the Earth
The nexus
You can't believe in what you hear
Point of all
The fighting and trouble on the earth
The nexus
You can't believe in what you hearEmbed NEXUS <PODv> iv SawanoHiroyuki[nZk];Laco anime
