1 ContributorFall For You Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
I been wondering if you remember
I said that we're not meant for each other
'Cause I don't believe in soulmates
But I won't let that get in the way
I don't mean to complicate it
But there's no other way around it
To try to make one out of two
When I am me and you are you
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus]
When I fall for you
I'll change my colors if I have to
If anyone is worth it, I think it's you
Baby, I'd die for you
When I fall for you
We'll dance like the leaves when their time is due
Forgive and forget to make room for new
Baby, I'd die for you
I'll fall for you
I'll fall for you

[Pre- Chorus]
여름의 열기가 식은 후
달라진 모습의 me and you
나뭇잎은 이미 변해가고 있네
그렇게 마주하는 우리의
결말은 아니길 바래
Yeah 사랑은 참 쉽지 않네
배려는 가식이 아니라고 했어
나는 너를 위해 떨어질 수 있어

When I fall for you
I'll change my colors if I have to
If anyone is worth it, I think it's you
Baby, I'd die for you
When I fall for you
We'll dance like the leaves when their time is due
Forgive what was said to make room for new
Baby, I'd die for you
I'll fall for you
I'll fall for you4Embed Fall for You Fall for You Sarah Kang;Jesse Barrera chill
