1 ContributorFinally Lyrics[Intro]
Finally, you get what I need
Bet them kisses so sweet
On my cheek, on my thigh, yeah

[Verse 1]
That ain't cool
You been testing all my patience
I got work, annual vacation, get a clue
Oh oh
If I were you
I'd be sampling temptation
You that high that I been chasing like a fool
Oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you calling me constantly
Blowing my phone up and coming around
Don't let me down, uh
I want you calling me constantly
Blowing my phone up and coming around
Don't let me down
'Cause

[Chorus]
Finally, you get what I need
Bet them kisses so sweet
On my cheek, on my thigh, yeah
Finally, you get what I need
And my feeling's so deep
I just might ride or die, yeah
You might also like[Verse 2]
Fight or flight
My adrenaline is pumping
But you gotta show me something
No goodbye
Don't waste my time
You been playing it too cool
Hard-to-get like we in high school
Ain't got all night

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you calling me constantly
Blowing my phone up and coming around
Don't let me down, uh
I want you calling me constantly
Blowing my phone up and coming around
Don't let me down
'Cause

[Chorus]
Finally, you get what I need
Bet them kisses so sweet
On my cheek, on my thigh, yeah
Finally, you get what I need
And my feeling's so deep
I just might ride or die, yeah
[Bridge]
Finally you got me right
Finally, get what I like
Finally you read my mind
Finally, finally, finally, yeah

[Chorus]
Finally, you get what I need
Bet them kisses so sweet
On my cheek, on my thigh, yeah
Finally, you get what I need
And my feeling's so deep
I just might ride or die, yeahEmbed Finally Finally Yves V;HUGEL progressive-house
