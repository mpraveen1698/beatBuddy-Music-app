4 ContributorsThese Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come closer
To the music
Make me want you
Make me lose it
Oh, come closer
To the music
Need all of your company

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just wanna feel it
Can you feel it?
Like a melody in the air
And I don't wanna need it
But I need it
Come get high on it if you dare

[Chorus]
These nights
We learn to love again
These times
They go and come again
These nights
Make it easy to pretend
Like this night can never end, it's alright, alright

Start a fire
It's a movement
Lift me higher

Deep desire
Yeah, you gotta use it
Need all of your company
And I just wanna feel it
