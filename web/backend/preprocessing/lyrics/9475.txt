6 ContributorsLiving In A Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was never the kind
To be taking my time
Any place that's worth a damn
And today's another day
That I've gone and thrown away
And I don't care where it lands

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm just thinking about us

[Chorus]
I've been living in a dream about you
And now I know you were all I ever wanted on my mind
And if I never see
My own reality
Well, I'm okay to leave it all behind

[Verse 2]
I'll be gone for a time
Tuning out for a while
It's gonna look like I'm not all there
I've decided that today
Seems alright to piss away
Ignore my empty stare

[Chorus]
I've been living in a dream about you
And now I know you were all I ever wanted on my mind
And if I never see
My own reality
Well, I'm okay to leave it all behind

[Bridge]
When I come down
And look around
I can't believe
The fantasy is gone like a memory
Out of my reach
Fading out from me
You're fading out from me, yeah

[Chorus]
I've been living in a dream about you
And now I know you were all I ever wanted on my mind
And if I never see
My own reality
Well, I'm okay to leave it all behindEmbed Living In A Dream Life Turns Electric (BonusTrack Version) Finger Eleven grunge
