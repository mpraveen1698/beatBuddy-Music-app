8 ContributorsOutta Time Lyrics[Intro: KillBunk]
Yeah
Uh, uh
Yeah, uh

[Chorus: KillBunk]
Bitch, I'm running outta time, get out my fucking face, hoe
Want more money, money, money, I just want the pesos
This my first time getting high today
I be off the drugs, they ask me if I wanna die today
I was with my bitch, I ask her if she wanna die today
God damn, I'm still going through a lot of things
When I leave the scene, it look like I just hit the lottery
Yeah, lottery, lil' nigga, there ain't no stopping me
I can't flop, okay
They keep telling me to drop, okay

[Verse 1: KillBunk]
They keep telling me to drop, ayy
Yeah they know that I'm gon' get it, bunk on top
Pour the lean, sipping Wock'
You a fiend, you off rocks
Ayy, bitch if you come into my crib, give me top
I just wanna rock out
Fuck all of them niggas, what they talk 'bout?
She say she up north, lil' baby, this shit going south
Had to get this money, go and switch the route
I just popped a upper but this shit keep going down

Shit keeping going down
Shit keeping going down
Shit keeping going down

[Chorus: KillBunk]
I was with my bitch, I ask her if she wanna die today
God damn, I'm still going through a lot of things
When I leave the scene, it look like I just hit the lottery
Yeah, lottery, lil' nigga, there ain't no stopping me
I can't flop, okay
They keep telling me to drop, okay

[Verse 2: DustyStayTrue]
I'm pulling up in a truck
Need my Glock, I keep it tucked
Back-to-back, I bet on black, I spent like fifty on this bus'
And I know niggas fake, I know they faux, they camouflage
So when those coppers come around, we turn them cameras off
I wasn't tryna hurt your feelings, I was tryna ball
Why you stressin'? Why you fussin'? I can't talk at all (Talk at all)
Nowadays, it really seem like we don't talk at all
And when them choppers get to bussin', I can't call it off

[Chorus: DustyStayTrue & KillBunk]
Bitch, I'm running outta time, get out my fucking face, ho
Want more money, money, money, I just want the pesos
This my first time getting high today
I be off the drugs, they ask me if I wanna die today
I was with my bitch, I ask her if she wanna die today
God damn, I'm still going through a lot of things
When I leave the scene, it look like I just hit the lottery
Yeah, lottery, lil' nigga, there ain't no stopping me
I can't flop, okay
They keep telling me to drop, okay1Embed Outta Time Outta Time KillBunk;Dustystaytrue sad
