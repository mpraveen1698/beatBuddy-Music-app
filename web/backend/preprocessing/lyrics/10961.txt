6 ContributorsOctober Eyes Lyrics[musical interlude]

All the lack of symmetry fits you so perfectly lady
Yes I fall with your clothes take em' off hold me close, baby

Those October eyes
Keep me up all night
Darling, my sunrise is when you go

If god spends extra time
Didn't waste a single dime on you
Bless your arms, Bless your breath
Singing songs to my chest as we dance the crowd away

Ah do do do do do
Ah do do do do do
Ah do do do do
Oooo... Oooo...

Say you hate your little nose
Girl, I love that little nose, always
The way you sway in those jeans means so damn much to me
Yeah, you do

Those October eyes
Couldn't hold one lie
Got my heart so wide
Like windows and stereos

Yeah you are merry for a hangover
Put some gasoline up in my motor
Girl Id buy a ring if I could afford to, right now

October eyes
Ah do do do do do
Yeah
Those October eyes
Ah do do do do do
Mhmm yeah
Those October eyes
(you are merry for a hangover)
Ah do do do do do
(Put some gasoline up in my motor)
Those October eyes
(Girl Id buy a ring if I could afford to)
Ah do do do do do, you2Embed October Eyes October Eyes Alt Bloom chill
