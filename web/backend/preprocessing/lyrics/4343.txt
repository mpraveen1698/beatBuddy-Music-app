3 ContributorsMeet Me At Our Spot (Live) Lyrics[Verse 1: WILLOW, WILLOW & Tyler Cole]
When I wake up
I can't even stay up
I slept through the day, fuck
I'm not getting younger
But when I'm older
I'll be so much stronger
I'll stay up for longer
Meet me at our spot

[Chorus: WILLOW, Tyler Cole,WILLOW & Tyler Cole]
Caught a vibe (Woo, yeah)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes )
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive (Woo, yeah)
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must bе the life

[Verse 2: Tyler Cole, WILLOW & Tyler Cole]
When I go to sleep
I can't еven fall asleep
Something's got ahold of me
Feel it taking over me
But when I'm older I'll be moving onward
I just got a drunk text
Meet me at our spot
You might also like[Chorus: Tyler Cole, WILLOW & Tyler Cole]
Yeah, we caught a vibe (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
When I look into your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna hold you all night (All night)
Maybe we can take a drive (Take a drive)
Baby, we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life

[Bridge: WILLOW & Tyler Cole]
Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there
Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there

[Chorus: WILLOW, Tyler Cole,WILLOW & Tyler Cole]
We caught a vibe (Woo, yeah)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes )
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive (Woo, yeah)
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
