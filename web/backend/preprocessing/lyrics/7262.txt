2 Contributors​juice Lyrics[Verse 1]
Saw you leaning over the counter
Your drink’s not getting any colder
You’ve been here well over an hour
It’s like i’m waiting for an answer
Hair tangled up in a flower
Caught in a daze it’s your power
Thinking of getting in closer
My heart is yours to devour
Could it be you’re my messiah
Looking at you its my golden hour

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m drowning in your ocean
Come save me from the open
What you providing, got me excited
Now ya left me all confused

[Chorus]
Girl ya got me (got me loose, got me loose)
Can’t еven blame it on the juicе (on the juice,on the juice yeah) Now we breaking all the rules yea yea yea

Parking lot, come take a drive with me
