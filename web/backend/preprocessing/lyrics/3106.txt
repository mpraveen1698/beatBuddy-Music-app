(Uh) I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
These players come to get me 'cause they'd like my behind
I can't love my business if I can't get a trick
Down on Santa Monica where tricks are for kids

Woah, come on and kick me
Woah, come on and kick me

[Chorus]
(Whoa, whoa) Come on and kick me
(Whoa, whoa) You've got your problems
(Whoa, whoa) I've got my ass wipe
(Whoa, whoa) You've got your big G's
I've got my hash pipe
Uh

Of men that don't bother with the taste of a teat

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, come on and kick me
Woah, come on and kick me
