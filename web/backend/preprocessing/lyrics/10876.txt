1 ContributorDays I will Remember LyricsThese are the days I will remember
These are the faces I need most
Everything changes but I'll keep forever
These days I will remember, these days I will remember

Still got that trophy that said second place
Still got that breakup letter from my old flame
And I know it's been too long to recall it right
But you don't forget the goodbyes
And you don't forget the good times

Still got that scar from my one and only fight
Still remember when your father left and we drove all night
And I know it's been too long to recall it right
But you don't forget the goodbyes
And you don't forget good times
No you don't forget the goodbyes
And you don't forget good times

These are the days I will remember
These are the faces I need most
Everything changes but I'll keep forever
These days I will remember, these days I will remember

Still got that blanket from when you were born
That night love hit me like a heavy storm
And I know it's been too long to recall it right
But you don't forget the goodbye
And you don't forget the good times
No you don't forget the goodbye
And you don't forget the good times

These are the faces I need most
Everything changes but I'll keep forever
These days I will remember, these days I will remember

These are the days I will remember
These are the faces I want close
If everything changes and we're not together
These days I will remember, these days I will remember
These days I will remember

Sometimes you know it's time to go
But you just wanna hold on, hold on
Sometimes you know it's time to go
But you just wanna hold on, hold on
Hold on

These are the days I will remember
These are the faces I need most
Everything changes but I'll keep forever
These days I will remember, these days I will remember

These are the days I will remember
These are the faces I want close
If everything changes and we're not together
These days I will remember, these days I will remember
