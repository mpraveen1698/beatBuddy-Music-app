Blacked out, how'd the other night last?
Maybe come around for a minute, shit, I like that
I could never catch, taking aim, might've missed you
Couple hundred miles out, if I hear the text, mm
Know you're probably
Blacked out, how'd the other night last?
Maybe come around for a minute, shit, I like that
I could never catch, taking aim, might've missed you
Know you're probably

[Verse 1]
Blacked out, get the bag now
Where the address, where's he at now?
Don't let me back there
My death be regicide, that's if I'm ever gone
If you pop me in my face, please spare the better side
Tapped out in my hands, only for one time
"Let her go," I'm trying, the worst oh
Let her go, let her go, she'll be running back
Sell her soul, I'll buy it, nothing to worry 'bout
Eighteen days until she blow, said I'll pass
See the AC great, ride in the Rove'
When the car stop, changing lanes, fill the cup
'Til my heart drop, changing lanes, fill the cup, say

Blacked out, how'd the other night last?
Maybe come around for a minute, shit, I like that

Couple hundred miles out, if I hear the text, mm
Know you're probably
Blacked out, how'd the other night last?
Maybe come around for a minute, shit, I like that
I could never catch, taking aim, might've missed you
Know you're probably

[Verse 2]
Addy'd up (Ooh), Addy'd up
What I like is never enough
Barely a time that I could share with others
Bought a new table just to skip supper
And all of my demons in bed, what you call it?
I left all of my demons on read, not a problem, mm
Wake up, wake up, mm
Barely a time that

[Chorus]
Blacked out, how'd the other night last?
Maybe come around for a minute, shit, I like that
I could never catch, taking aim, might've missed you
Couple hundred miles out, if I hear the text, mm
