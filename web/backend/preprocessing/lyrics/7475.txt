Break through the undertow
Your hands I can't seem to find
Pollution burns my tongue
Cough words I can't speak, so I
Stop my struggling
Then I float to the surface
Fill my lungs with air, then let it out

[Chorus 1]
I give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me

[Verse 2]
Rock bottom's where we live
And still we dig these trenches
To bury ourselves in them
Backs breaking under tension
Before far too long these voices
Muffled by distances
It's time to come to our senses
Up from the dirt

[Chorus 2]
We give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me

Breathe (breathe)
The air we give (give)
The life we live (live)
Our pulses racing distances
(Breathe) so wet my tongue
(Give) break into song
(Live) through seas of competition

[Verse 3]
So please believe your eyes
A sacrifice
Is not what we had in our minds
I'm coming home tonight
Home tonight

[Chorus 2]
We give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me

[Outro]
Today I offer all myself to this
I'm living for my dying wish
I give it all
Now there's a reason
There's a reason
To give it all8Embed Give It All Siren Song Of The Counter-Culture Rise Against hardcore
