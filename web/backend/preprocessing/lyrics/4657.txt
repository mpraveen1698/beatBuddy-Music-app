If there's a prize for rotten judgment
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history, been there, done that
Who d'you think you're kiddin'?
He's the earth and heaven to you
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through you (Oh, no)
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you're feelin', who you're thinkin' of (Oh)

[Chorus: Meg & Muses]
(Shoo, shoo-doo, doo-doo) No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no (Doo-doo)
You swoon, you sigh
Why deny it? Uh-oh
It's too cliché (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I won't say I'm in love
Shoo-doo, shoo-doo, ooh

[Verse 2: Meg, Muses, Meg & Muses]
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
(Ah) My head is screaming, "Get a grip, girl"
"Unless you're dyin' to cry your heart out" (Oh)
You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby, we're not buying
Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling (Oh, no)
Face it like a grown-up
When ya gonna own up
That you got, got, got it bad? (Woah)

(Shoo, shoo-doo, doo-doo) No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
Give up, give in
Check the grin, you're in love
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love
You're doin' flips (Ooh-ooh)
Read our lips, you're in love

[Post-Chorus: Meg & Muses]
You're way off base (Shoo-doo, shoo-doo)
I won't say it (She won't say it, no)
Get off my case (Sha-da, sha-da)
I won't say it (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Girl, go be proud
It's okay, you're in love

[Outro: MEG, MUSES]
Oh
At least, out loud
I won't say I'm in love
Shoo-doo, shoo-doo, shoo-doo, shoo-doo
