12 ContributorsI Don’t Know Why Lyrics[Verse 1]
Following a feeling
Got no reason I should show up
Here tonight, here tonight
And I'm hoping for a signal
But I'll settle for your body
In my mind, in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Starts as innocent
But moves so quickly, so quickly
Yeah, when you look at me
I must be dreaming

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
The room keeps shaking
Put your arms around me and the walls start breaking
Tell me that you found me and my world starts changing
I see it all in my mind
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
The floor keeps spinning
Whisper in my ear that I'm the one you needed
Touch me like I've never even felt this feeling
Baby, I wish you were mine
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why

Started as a fantasy
But I found it so hard to
Push it down, push it down
How at any given moment
I would say your name so I could
Hear the sound, hear the sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Starts as innocent
But moves so quickly, so quickly
Yeah, when you look at me
I must be dreaming

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
The room keeps shaking
Put your arms around me and the walls start breaking
Tell me that you found me and my world starts changing
I see it all in my mind
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
The floor keeps spinning
Whisper in my ear that I'm the one you needed
Touch me like I've never even felt this feeling
Baby, I wish you were mine
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
[Pre-Chorus]
Starts as innocent
But moves so quickly, so quickly
Yeah, when you look at me
I must be dreaming

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
The room keeps shaking
Put your arms around me and the walls start breaking
Tell me that you found me and my world starts changing
I see it all in my mind
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
The floor keeps spinning
Whisper in my ear that I'm the one you needed
Touch me like I've never even felt this feeling
Baby, I wish you were mine
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why

[Outro]
Oh, I don't know, I don't know
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know, I don't know
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why3Embed I Don't Know Why I Don't Know Why NOTD;Astrid S house
