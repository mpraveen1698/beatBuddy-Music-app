13 ContributorsBetter Days Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you ever want to waste away
Recounting better times?
I'm with you
Is this all we have left to live with?
I only wanna get by
So with that, I don't mind getting by
Reliving moments lived 'til my last breath

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you get it?
Suffocating, can't breathe, but you've got a fucking mouth to feed
Never made the effort to change or go out of our way

[Chorus]
You follow your sorrows
For better days we've waited for how long, how long?
You follow your sorrows
We spiral downward endlessly
But is the bottom where we're meant to be?

[Verse 2]
Is anybody listening?
Can anybody tell me why I can't get up?
Why can't I get up?
Down on my knees as the world comes falling down
My fear chained to the ground for my will is weak
And my state is bleak
You might also like[Bridge]
But I'm bound to break free
Pride running through my veins
My chains lay flat around me
My chains lay flat around me
How long do we endure the pain?
How long 'til we accept?

[Chorus]
You follow your sorrows
For better days we've waited for how long, how long?
You follow your sorrows
We spiral downward endlessly
But is the bottom where we're meant to be?

[Post-Chorus]
This isn't where we're meant to be
We spiral endlessly

[Outro]
You follow your sorrows (Do you get it?)
For better days we've waited for how long, how long? (Suffocating, can't breathe, but you've got a fucking mouth to feed)
(Never made the effort to change or go out of our way)
You follow your sorrows (Is anybody listening? Are you listening?)
We spiral downward endlessly
But is the bottom where we're meant to be?4Embed Better Days The Way It Ends Currents death-metal
