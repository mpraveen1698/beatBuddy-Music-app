35 ContributorsStronger Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't do this for the riches
I'm infected, my condition
Is I'm always in my head
These words are my religion
I'm obsessed, it's by decision
I'ma do this 'til I'm dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Set me on fire
Set me on, set me on fire (Whoa, whoa-oh)
I'm still alive
I'm still ali- I'm still alive (Whoa)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Higher, faster, everlasting
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Higher, faster, never-crashing
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

[Chorus]
Stronger
(Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Stronger
(Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

I do this with conviction
I write truths and never fiction
My disease is what you fed
I can't stop with my ambition
Like a missile on a mission
I'm a force that you will dread

[Pre-Chorus]
Set me on fire
Set me on, set me on fire (Whoa, whoa-oh)
I'm still alive
I'm still ali- I'm still alive (Whoa)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Bet you thought that I was dead
But I'm not dead
I'm not dead
Bet you thought that I was dead
But I'm not dead
I'm not dead
Stronger, stronger, everlasting
Higher, faster, never-crashing
Stronger, stronger, everlasting
Higher, faster,  never-crashing
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
