1 ContributorInto you LyricsI'm breathing, I'm feeling alone
I know that you're leaving while we're still undone
It's gone right before our faces
Gone without a trace
We had something special
I don't need no space
So come back now
Won't you give me some hope, come on
I'll be dancing like nobody is watching
And I wanna be what you need for a second
'Cause I'm into you
Now I'm trying to get your attention
So I'm calling you up on my best intentions
'Cause I'm into you
I'm into you
I'm into you
Remember the fire we had
Our eyes, thеy're shining so bright when our hearts collidе
I don't need a doctor, you're my medicine
Giving me a high when walls are caving in
So come back now
Won't you give me something, tonight
I'll be dancing like nobody is watching
And I wanna be what you need for a second
'Cause I'm into you
Now I'm trying to get your attention
So I'm calling you up on my best intentions
'Cause I'm into you
I'm into you
I'm into you
I'm into you
I'm into you
Dancing like nobody is watching
And I wanna be what you need for a second
'Cause I'm into you
I'm into youYou might also likeEmbed Into You Into You Matisse & Sadko;Hanne Mjøen electro
