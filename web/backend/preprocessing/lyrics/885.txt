Stay-ay-ay-ay ya, away-ay ya, away-ay ya

[Verse 1]
Hide the sun
I will leave your face out of my mind
You should save your eyes
A thousand voices howling in my head

[Verse 2]
Speak in tongues
I don't even recognize your face
Mirror on the wall
Tell me all the ways to stay away

[Chorus 1]
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
And stay away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya

[Verse 3]
Dig a hole
Fireworks exploding in my hands
If I could paint the sky
Well all the stars we shine are burning red
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Stay-ay ay ay ya
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
And stay-ay ay ay ya
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya

[Background]
And stay-
Away-ay ya (I'm hearing voices all the time and they're not mine)
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya (I'm hearing voices and they're haunting my mind)
And stay-
Away-ay ya (I'm hearing voices all the time and they're not mine)
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya (I'm hearing voices and they're haunting my mind)

[Outro]
