39 ContributorsEverybodyâ€™s Fool Lyrics[Verse 1]
Perfect by nature
Icons of self-indulgence
Just what we all need
More lies about a world

[Chorus]
That never was and never will be
Have you no shame? Don't you see me?
You know you've got everybody fooled

[Verse 2]
Look, here she comes now
Bow down and stare in wonder
Oh, how we love you
No flaws when you're pretending
But now I know

[Chorus]
She never was and never will be
You don't know how you betrayed me
And somehow you've got everybody fooled

[Bridge]
Without the mask
Where will you hide?
Can't find yourself
Lost in your lie
I know the truth now
I know who you are
And I don't love you anymore

It never was and never will be
You don't know how you betrayed me
And somehow you've got everybody fooled
It never was and never will be
You're not real and you can't save me
And somehow now you're everybody's fool17Embed Everybody's Fool Fallen Evanescence metal
