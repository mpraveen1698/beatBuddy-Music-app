8 ContributorsWhat You Make It Lyrics[Intro]
I'm just a star fading, falling naked
Burning through my own frustration
Whatever, not your savior
I just think life's what you make it

[Verse 1]
I'm a motel stay on a weeknight
There's a hole in the door but the pool's fine
Take the light with the dark, it's a contrast love, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm a plane and I'm blocking your sunlight
I'm a first-class ticket to a fistfight
Took a hit to the ribs but I feel just fine, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre Chorus]
And I can see that everything repeats
It's all just drop-dead typical
I can see it going on and on

[Chorus]
I'm just a star fading, falling naked
Burning through my own frustration
Whatever, not your savior
I just think life's what you make it
Star fading, falling naked
Burning through my own frustration
Whatever, not your savior
I just think life's what you make it

I'm your fucked up leg in thе fun run (Fun run)
I'm a jet ski ride in a hot tub (Hot tub)
Nevеr quite what you want but I just don't care, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre Chorus]
And I can see that everything repeats
It's all just drop-dead typical
I can see it going on and on (Going on and on)

[Chorus]
I'm just a star fading, falling naked
Burning through my own frustration
Whatever, not your savior
I just think life's what you make it
Star fading, falling naked
Burning through my own frustration
Whatever, not your savior
I just think life's what you make it

[Bridge]
I'm a motel stay on a weeknight
There's a hole in the door but the pool's fine
Never quite what you want but I just don't care

[Chorus]
I'm just a star fading, falling naked
Burning through my own frustration
Whatever, not your savior
I just think life's what you make it
Star fading, falling naked
Burning through my own frustration
Whatever, not your savior
I just think life's what you make it1Embed What You Make It With Confidence With Confidence punk-rock
