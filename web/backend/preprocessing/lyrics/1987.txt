Baby, I call in the dead of night
But you don't need me like I need you
Pray that I won't be alone
Baby, I call in the dead of night
But you don't need me like I need you
Pray that I won't be alone

[Verse]
Layin' on the bed waitin' for your text (Be alone)
Babe, there's nothin' left
Faded, I'm a wreck (Be alone)
Afraid what's comin' next
Wished we never met (Be alone)
Layin' us to rest but baby, I beg you (Be alone)
Too soon with a drunk call
In the middle of the night
You took it, my fault (Be alone)
Didn't really mean to interrupt (Be alone)
But if you change your mind, then hit me up (Be alone)

[Chorus]
Pain, that's an option
No time for nonsense
Can't ask you nothing
Drank, feeling nauseous
Too many toxins, not even conscious
Say nothin' more, say nothin' more, baby
Pain, that's an option
No time for nonsense
Can't ask you nothing
Drank, feeling nauseous
Too many toxins, not even conscious
Say nothin' more, say nothin' more, baby

We're better on our own
Tonight, I'm gettin' throwed (You don't need me)
She never comin' home
Stay with me (Pray that I won't be alone)
Say you'll leave (You don't need me)
(Be alone, yeah-eah-eah-eah)

[Chorus]
Pain, that's an option
No time for nonsense
Can't ask you nothing
Drank, feeling nauseous
Too many toxins, not even conscious
Say nothin' more, say nothin' more, baby
Pain, that's an option
No time for nonsense
Can't ask you nothing
Drank, feeling nauseous
Too many toxins, not even conscious
Say nothin' more, say nothin' more, baby

[Outro]
