Yeah

[Verse 1]
There comes Fenris' twin, his jaws are open wide
The serpent rises from the waves
Jormungandr twists and turns, mighty in his wrath
The eyes are full of primal hate

[Chorus]
Thor! Odin's son, protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate, your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son, protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate, Ragnarök awaits

[Verse 2]
Vingtor rise to face the snake with hammer high
At the edge of the world
Bolts of lightning fills the air as Mjölnir does its work
The dreadful serpent roars in pain

[Chorus]
Thor! Odin's son, protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate, your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son, protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate, Ragnarök awaits

Mighty Thor grips the snake firmly by its tongue
Lifts his hammer high to strike soon his work is done
Vingtor sends the giant snake bleeding to the depth
Twilight of the thunder god, Ragnarök awaits
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Thor! Odin's son, protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate, your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son, protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate, Ragnarök awaits10Embed Twilight Of The Thunder God Twilight Of The Thunder God Amon Amarth death-metal
