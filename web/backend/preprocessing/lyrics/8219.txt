11 ContributorsNever Change Lyrics[Chorus]
I've just been so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
I been so damn lonely
These niggas actin' phony, phony, phony, phony
Actin' so damn phony
Just get out my way
Swerving through lanes, I'll be drifting away
And I can't complain, swear that I'll be okay
We are not the same, no, I'm never gon' change
Change

[Verse 1]
I just keep goin', know I been so broken
These niggas done changed, yet they knockin' my flows in
All smiles, can't tell that my heart's just been frozen
Stay low-low-low-key now, don't cause no commotion
That's just for promotion, raw is my emotion
These songs that I'm composin' stay fly, that's 'cause I'm chosen
And I don't do the boastin', but all she do is post 'еm
She like me 'causе I'm open and I ain't off the potion
But I might be crispy like a white tee
Meditated like tai chi, keep a check like Nike
Can't find a nigga that's like me, but I see
Fuck niggas, that's high-key
Plottin' on me, most likely
Can't fuck with me 'cause I'm icy
You might also like[Chorus]
I've just been so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
I been so damn lonely
These niggas actin' phony, phony, phony, phony
Actin' so damn phony
Just get out my way
Swerving through lanes, I'll be drifting away
And I can't complain, swear that I'll be okay
We are not the same, no, I'm never gon' change
Change

[Verse 2]
I'm leanin' on the fixture and I been off the liquor
Sippin' on that Remy with that Henny, what a mixture
They follow me like scripture and I've been gettin' quicker
Been had the upper hand, I hand to hand it like a pitcher

[Bridge]
And we never gon' fall
All my brothers on call
We forever gon' ball
No, it's nothin' at all

[Chorus]
I've just been so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
I been so damn lonely
These niggas actin' phony, phony, phony, phony
Actin' so damn phony
Just get out my way
Swerving through lanes, I'll be drifting away
And I can't complain, swear that I'll be okay
We are not the same, no, I'm never gon' change
