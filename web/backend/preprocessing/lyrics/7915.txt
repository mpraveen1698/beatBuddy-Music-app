The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

[Bridge: Ella Fitzgerald]
We may never, never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of

[Verse 2: Ella Fitzgerald]
The way you hold your knife
The way we danced 'til three
The way you've changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

[Verse 3: Louis Armstrong]

The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me
