Hey mijo, it's me again, I've been trying to call you already
5-6 times, you're not pickin' up your phone and I'm worried
Es, son las tres en la mañana, babe ¿donde estas?

[Verse 1: Ms Krazie]
I know I always bring this up but now it's time we talk
Mijo please take a lil' minute sit back and relax
Listen to my words I ain't trying to be your mom
Te quiero mucho por favor, and I deserve to know what's up
All those late night calls, when you gotta bounce
Your homies coming first, what's that all about?
I fell in love with a gangster yeah, that's right
But I don't think you realize how I hurt inside
Always worryin', mi pelón, if your comin' home
That's why I call you so much when you leave me alone
I don't wanna bug and this I promise you but in this situation
It's so hard to trust you, I care 'bout you so much lovin' you like
Crazy all I really want is to have your little baby
Tell me that you love me, u will never leave me
Soy la reina de tu vida and you're happy to be with me

[Chorus: Ms Krazie & Chino Grande]
Daddy, let me know that I'm your only girl
The only man that I need in this gangster world
Is you and I wouldn't trade it
So why u think I would lie? Won't you tell me girl?
The only one that I need in my gangster world is you
And I wouldn't trade it

See, I know it's been a struggle I can see in your eyes
Tear drops, they fall get me every time
Baby girl don't cry understand that I try
The only hope that I hold in my gangster life
I hold you dear to my heart though I'm out in the night
Tryin to make a lil' money then come home to a fight
A little fuss can't trust that's it's never enough
Was embraced by your touch in this thing called
Love although I leave so prestige with my hand on
My heat I got jar full of bozers so we all can eat
Comprehend that I spend most my time on the street
And all these other wicked women don't matter to me
It's not like I'm just tryin to get up and leave I work hard every
Minute in the face of defeat I find my feelings would
Cry knowing that u by my side wat u think I was just
Gonna let u walk on by?

[Chorus: Ms Krazie & Chino Grande]
Daddy, let me know that I'm your only girl
The only man that I need in this gangster world
Is you and I wouldn't trade it
So why u think I would lie? Won't u tell me girl?
The only one that I need in my gangster world is you
And I wouldn't trade it
[Verse 3: Ms Krazie]
I understand what your tellin me but it's so hard
Always fuss and we fight tell we back at the start
Te amo te quiero mi crazy vato gangero
Se le k yo tengo con tigo pero te tengo
I know you mean well when you hold me tight
The only one who can handle me like
Every fight and I cherish all the times that
I spend with you hold your pictures in my hand
When I pray for you this is gangster love and I'm
Down for whatever lay me down on the cama
And enjoy that were together turn on the candles
Hickies on my cuello, mi firme veterano, mi firme
Panqitero always down to ride with you like bonnie
And clyde with you I'll always stand with you forever be true
Keep you on my mente siempre mi vida I'm a gangster's
Wife to an anybody killer

[Chorus: Ms Krazie & Chino Grande]
Daddy, let me know that I'm your only girl
The only man that I need in this gangster world
Is you and I wouldn't trade it
So why you think I would lie? Won't u tell me girl?
The only one that I need in my gangster world is you
And I wouldn't trade it
