In this hole, that is me
The dead are rolling over
In this hole thickening
Dirt shoveled over shoulders

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I feel it in me, so overwhelmed
Oh, this pressured center rising
My life overturned, unfair the despair
All these scars keep ripping open

[Chorus]
Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

[Verse 2]
In this hole, that is me
A life that's growing feeble
In this hole, so limiting
The sun has set, all darkens

Buried underneath, hands slip off the wheel
Internal path-way to contention

[Chorus]
Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

[Bridge]
Are you happy?
Are you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
In this hole that is me, left with a heart exhausted
What's my release? What sets me free?
Do you pull me up just to push me down again?

[Chorus]
Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?
[Outro]
Peel me from the skin
(Peel me from the skin)
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear me from the bone
(Tear me from the bone)
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you fucking happy?
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing
Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you fucking happy?
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing13Embed Happy? Lost and Found Mudvayne groove
