7 ContributorsBLUE Lyrics[Chorus]
Feeling blue without you
Give me one more chance, give me one more dance
I'm feeling blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
Just feeling blue without you
Give me one more chance, give me one more dance
I'm feeling blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down

[Verse 1]
I dream that you won't forget me
That's all I really ask of ya
I'd love to talk if you'd let me
I'll take you back to the start with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep on dreaming, I don't know why
I can't seem to let it go
But I keep on tripping on what we had
It's hard not to let you know

[Chorus]
I'm feeling blue without you
Give me one more chance, give me one more dance
I'm feeling blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
I'm feeling blue without you
I don't know what I should do-o-o-o
Feeling so blue without you

We built our love on foundations
We built a house on the hill, yeah
Our little rock of salvation
Oh, my love's there still

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I keep on dreaming, I don't know why
I can't seem to let it go
But I keep on tripping on what we had
It's hard not to let you know

[Chorus]
I'm feeling blue without you
Give me one more chance, give me one more dance
I'm feeling blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
I'm feeling blue, yeah
Oh, give me one more chance, give me one more dance
I'm blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
Just feeling blue without youEmbed BLUE BLUE Tiësto;Stevie Appleton trance
