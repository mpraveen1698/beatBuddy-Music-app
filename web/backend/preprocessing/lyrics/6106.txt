46 ContributorsDancing On My Own Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than I can?
It's a big, black sky over my town
I know where you at, I bet she's around

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I know it's stupid
I just gotta see it for myself

[Chorus]
I'm in the corner
Watchin' you kiss her, oh
I'm right over here
Why can't you see me? Oh
I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the girl you're takin' home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own

[Verse 2]
I'm just gonna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so outta line

[Pre-Chorus]
Stilettos on broken bottles
I'm spinnin' around in circles
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm in the corner
Watchin' you kiss her, oh
I'm right over here
Why can't you see me? Oh
I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the girl you're takin' home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own

[Bridge]
So far away, but still so near
The lights go on, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye

[Break]
I'm in the corner
Watchin' you kiss her, oh

[Chorus]
I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the girl you're takin' home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own (Oh, yeah)
I'm in the corner
Watchin' you kiss her, oh
I'm right over here
Why can't you see me? Oh
I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the girl you're takin' home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own
[Post-Chorus]
I keep dancing on my own22Embed Dancing On My Own Body Talk Robyn swedish
