For the love of God, will you bite your tongue
Before we make you swallow it?
It's moments like this where silence is golden (Golden)
And then you speak
No one wants to hear you
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic, I'm begging you to spare me
The pleasure of your company

[Pre-Chorus]
When did the diamonds leave your bones?

[Chorus]
I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake
I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake

[Post-Chorus]
Go to hell, for heaven's sake

No one wants to hear you, save your breath
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic, you think that no one sees this?
I think it's time you knew the truth, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake
I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake

[Bridge]
When did the diamonds leave your bones?
Leave your bones

[Breakdown]
You're not a shepherd, you're just a sheep
A combined effort of everyone you meet
You're all flesh with no bone
Feed 'em to the sharks and throw 'em to the wolves
[Chorus]
I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake
I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell, for heaven's sake

[Outro]
Go to hell, for heaven's sake
