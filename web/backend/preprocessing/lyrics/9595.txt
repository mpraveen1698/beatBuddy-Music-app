2 ContributorsFeel My Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I confess, I confess
I've been wrong, oh so wrong
I believe, yes, I believe
It could've been so simple if I just let it be

[Chorus]
But I'm here on my knees
I'm screaming, "Oh God, please, won't you come take me now?"
I'll go to hell and back for you
So you can feel my love, feel my love

[Drop]
So you can feel my love, feel my love
So you can feel my love, feel my love

[Verse 2]
I confess, I confess
I'm gonna get it right this time
Now I own all my sins
Oh, I breathe them out a thousand times

[Chorus]
I'm still here on my knees
I'm singing, "Oh God, please, won't you come hear me now?"
I'll go to hell and back for you
So you can feel my love, feel my love
You might also like[Bridge]
I'll go to hell and back for you
So you can feel my love, feel my love
I'll give you everything and more
So you can feel my love, feel my love
I'm never gonna let this light go out
I'm never gonna let our love run cold
I'm never gonna let this light go out
So will you feel my love, feel my love?

[Drop]
So will you feel my love, feel my love?

[Outro]
Oh, no, no, no
I confess, I confess
Oh, no, no, no
So will you feel my love, feel my love?
Oh, no, no, noEmbed Feel My Love (feat. Joe Taylor) Feel My Love (feat. Joe Taylor) Lucas & Steve;DubVision;Joe Taylor progressive-house
