36 Contributorsâ€‹enough Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, oh-woah
Woah-oh, yeah, mmm-oh
Mmm-oh, mmm-oh
Woah, woah, ooh, woah, woah, yeah
I don't know where to call my home
There's a house where I sleep when I'm all alone
I feel like I've been underrated, yeah
People wanna talk shit, just say it

[Chorus]
Faygo in my double cup
Faygo in my double cup
Coming at me, but
I've already had enough of you
I think that I've had enough
(I think that I've had enough)
Let me run this up, let me run these fuckers up
I don't want this, baby
I don't want to fall in love with you
I don't want to fall in love
(I don't wanna fall in love)

[Verse 1]
Side girl keep on texting me but she not the one (She not the one)
Seems like I ain't lost my touch before I begun ('Fore I begun)
Keep on playing games after you've already won
Should have got away when I was able to run
Woman of the night is my only type
She'll come with you if you have a bottle for the night
She don't care about tomorrow 'cause she's living life
She just in it for the moment, way before the night, yeah
Wake up in the morning, vomit all on the walls
When she got the munchies, she know who she gon' call
Waiting on her friends to pick her up when she falls
Never knew that demons took form of Barbie dolls
You might also like[Bridge]
I know what you're thinking
Popped an Addy, now I can't stop blinking
Get piped, get ready for the weekend
All the monsters come out on the weekend

[Chorus]
Faygo in my double cup
Faygo in my double cup
Coming at me, but
I've already had enough of you
I think that I've had enough
(I think that I've had enough)
Let me run this up, let me run these fuckers up
I don't want this, baby
I don't want to fall in love with you
I don't want to fall in love
(I don't wanna fall in love)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like I need a break
They can't do what I've been doing, so they go and hate
I really feel like all this music is my only fate
I'm packing all this fuckin' heat like my name Johnny Dang
Yeah, it's all night, all day
Take me how you want, you can take me anyway
I'll be with you by your side, I'll be here to stay
Find me in the A.M., you can't find me in the day
Fuck a nine-to-five, I'll be in a foreign drive
And my digits on command, so I come and slide
Tell me how much mud you threw into the fucking Sprite
When I'm on the Percs, I'm finally feelin' alive (Oh)
[Bridge]
Finally feelin' alive
I've been taking all the doubt and I throw it aside
My diamonds lookin' like they came straight from the tide
When I'm on the drugs, I'm finally feelin' alive

[Chorus]
Faygo in my double cup
Faygo in my double cup
Coming at me, but
I've already had enough of you
I think that I've had enough
(I think that I've had enough)
Let me run this up, let me run these fuckers up
I don't want this, baby
I don't want to fall in love with you
I don't want to fall in love
(I don't wanna fall in love)19Embed enough enough 916frosty emo
