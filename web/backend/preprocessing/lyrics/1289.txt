Take me to your place (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's skip the foreplay (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Syd]
Hey, you ask me what I’m thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about us (Us)
And this is how the story begins
I'll never tell this story again
’Til one of us is making amends

[Chorus: Syd & Jesse Rutherford]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues (And I do too)

[Verse 2: Jesse Rutherford]
Daddy stuck around but he wasn't present
Cheated on your mom but she never left him
First I didn't get it, now I understand
He broke her heart, left money in her hands
So everything got paid for
She made sure you and your brother had way more
Than she ever had growing up (Yeah)
But when you told me the whole story, I felt like throwing up
I could see it on your face, it was rough
Left a bad taste on your tongue
And she didn't even take any drugs
She would rain all day, couldn't wait for her sun to shine
And you made it shine
There when she cried, you saved her life
You might also like[Chorus: Syd & Jesse Rutherford]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I’d run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues (And I do too)
And if you were my little girl
I’d do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues (And I do too)

[Outro: Syd & Jesse Rutherford]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues (And I do too)11Embed Daddy Issues (Remix) feat. Syd Daddy Issues (Remix) feat. Syd The Neighbourhood;Syd alternative
