5 ContributorsMove Your Body Lyrics[Verse]
The time is now and I'm here to stay
Come with me, baby (Come with me, baby), it's time to play
I took a vow, so we'll be okay
Come with me, baby (Come with me, baby), I'm yours today

[Chorus]
Move your feet, step up to the beat
Got the urge to move your body
Move your feet, step up to the beat
Got the urge to move your body
