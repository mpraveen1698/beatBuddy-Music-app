20 ContributorsUnsung Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your contribution left unnoticed some
Association with an image
Just credit time for showing up again
Attention wandered, I'm left with it

[Chorus 1]
Gone by sin too slowly
Can't pass it up
Then I thought nothing is right
I turned it off

[Verse 2]
To die unsung would really bring you down
Although wet eyes would never suit you
Walk through, no archetypal suicide
Die young is far too boring these days

[Chorus 2]
Your will to speak clearly
Exposed too much
Unsung once too often
Could not rub off
