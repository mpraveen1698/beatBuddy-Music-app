They say we're young and we don't know
We won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know if all that's true
'Cause you got me, and baby, I got you

[Chorus: Bono & Both]
Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe

[Verse 2: Bono & Cher]
They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

[Chorus: Bono & Both]
Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe

[Verse 3: Bono & Cher]
I got flowers in the spring, I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And if I get scared, you're always around
So let them say your hair's too long
Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb
You might also like[Chorus: Bono & Both]
Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe

[Bridge: Bono & Cher]
I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so

[Chorus: Both]
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe1Embed I Got You Babe Look At Us Sonny & Cher rock-n-roll
