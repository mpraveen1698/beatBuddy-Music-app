1 ContributorDon’t Let Our Love Die Lyrics[Verse 1]
There will be times when the waves hit harder
But we won't wash away
There will be days when the skies get darker
But we won’t fade to grey

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we fight all night and all our tears run dry
We'll be okay, okay, yeah
'Cause we can talk it out, nothing can bring us down, no
I won’t walk away

[Chorus]
Our love won't die, we'll stay alive
'Cause we're just too good to let it fade into dust
Let's make it right 'cause you and I
We're just too good to bring thе bad out of us
And if we break apart, we’ll pick up thе pieces
Pick ourselves up again
’Cause you and I, our love won't die
We’re just too good to let us fade into dust

[Drop]
Don't let our love, don't let our love die
Don't let our love, don’t let our love die
Don't let our love, don't let our love die
Don't let our love die

There will be times when I overthink it
'Cause I don't feel enough
There will be nights when you get too jealous
Findin' it hard to trust

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we fight all night and all our tears run dry
We'll be okay, okay, yeah
'Cause we can talk it out, nothing can bring us down, no
I won't walk away

[Chorus]
Our love won't die, we'll stay alive
'Cause we're just too good to let it fade into dust
Let's make it right 'cause you and I
We're just too good to bring the bad out of us
And if we break apart, we'll pick up the pieces
Pick ourselves up again
'Cause you and I, our love won't die
We're just too good to let us fade into dust

[Drop]
Don't let our love, don't let our love die
Don't let our love, don't let our love die
Don't let our love, don't let our love die
