This time it don’t feel like you want it all
Did I do something wrong to make you go?
Said I would know when it's all good to fall
Now I just need you here to hold me close

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I don't want another heart to fill the holes
That you left under my covers for me to grow cold
I don't wanna miss somebody who's not missing me
But the city feels so lonely when you leave

[Chorus]
My room, where I want you
Tangled ease in my sheets
In your shirt that I got you
Half asleep, holding onto me
My bed where you left me
Tangled up, now it's noon
In your shirt that you gave me
Half asleep, wishing I still had you

[Post-Chorus]
Half asleep, wishing I still had you

[Verse 2]
This time you said, you’re playing games again
What are we becoming of it now?
It's fine, I said, if you're the one in my head
'Cause I just don't know how to put you out
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't want another heart to fill the holes
That you left under my covers for me to grow cold
I don't wanna miss somebody who's not missing me
But the city feels so lonely when you leave

[Chorus]
My room, where I want you
Tangled ease in my sheets
In your shirt that I got you
Half asleep, holding onto me
My bed where you left me
Tangled up, now it's noon
In your shirt that you gave me
Half asleep, wishing I still had you

[Outro]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm half asleep, wishing I still had you12Embed Your Shirt Your Shirt Chelsea Cutler indie-pop
