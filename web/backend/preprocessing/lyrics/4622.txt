25 ContributorsFine Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
It seems like every day's the same
And I'm left to discover on my own
It seems like everything is gray
And there's no color to behold

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They say it's over, and I'm fine again, yeah
Try to stay sober, feels like I'm dyin' here

[Chorus]
And I am aware now of how everything's gonna be fine
One day, too late, I'm in Hell
I am prepared now, seems everyone's gonna be fine
One day, too late, just as well

[Verse 2]
I feel the dream in me expire
And there's no one left to blame it on
I hear you label me a liar
'Cause I can't seem to get this through

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You say it's over, I can sigh again, yeah
Why try to stay sober when I'm dyin' here?

And I am aware now of how everything's gonna be fine
One day, too late, I'm in Hell
I am prepared now, seems everyone's gonna be fine
One day, too late, just as well

[Bridge]
And I'm not scared now
I must assure you, you're never gonna get away
And I'm not scared now
And I'm not scared now, no

[Chorus]
And I am aware now of how everything's gonna be fine
One day, too late, I'm in Hell
I am prepared now, seems everyone's gonna be fine
One day, too late, just as well

[Outro]
I am prepared now, seems everything's gonna be fine
For me, for me, for myself
For me, for me, for myself
For me, for me, for myself
I am prepared now, for myself
I am prepared now
And I am fine again20Embed Fine Again Disclaimer Seether grunge
