22 ContributorsYou Might Be Sleeping Lyrics[Verse 1: Jakob Ogawa & Clairo]
Baby, when you're near (you're near)
It's warm (it's warm) inside (inside)
Sometimes when you stare (you stare)
Our hearts (our hearts) entwine (entwine)

[Chorus: Jakob Ogawa & Clairo]
And in the morning I'll be here
You might be sleeping without a care
And in the morning I'll be here
You might be dreaming
Play with your hair

[Verse 2: Clairo]
When I think about you, boy
My sadness disappears
I could lay around forever
You wipe away my tears

[Chorus: Jakob Ogawa & Clairo]
And in the morning I'll be here (I'll be here)
You might be sleeping without a care (without a care)
Doo, doo, doo... doo, doo, doo... duh, do, do
Doo, doo, doo... doo, doo, doo... duh, do, doYou might also like13Embed You Might Be Sleeping Bedroom Tapes Jakob;Clairo garage
