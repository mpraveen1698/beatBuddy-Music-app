2 ContributorsWalk Lyrics[Verse 1]
Used to run down this road
With my heart on fire
Now I’m sitting right here by the side
Like a bird on the wire
See my dream passing by
And I realise
The day that I quit
Is the day I expire

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah I gotta keep moving on, gotta keep moving on
Ooh I’m shaking the dirt from my bones
All I gotta do is walk

[Chorus]
I’m fighting and I’m bleeding
I don’t give up, I walk
My hope, my love, my reason
They guide me as I walk
Like Hannibal over the mountains
I gotta keep moving, I won’t stop
Keep on walking, watch out
Here I’m coming
Walk walk walk walk
Walk walk walk walk

Ain’t no knocking me over
I keep bouncing back
Now I’m done with the noise in my head
Yeah I follow my track
A battle for gold
And a dream in my soul
In times when I fail
I shakе off the pain and

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah I gotta keep moving on, gotta keep moving on oh woah
Ooh I’m shaking the dirt from my bones
All I gotta do is walk

[Chorus]
I’m fighting and I’m bleeding
I don’t givе up, I walk
My hope, my love, my reason
They guide me as I walk
Like Hannibal over the mountains
I gotta keep moving, I won’t stop
Keep on walking, watch out
Here I’m coming
Walk walk walk walk
Walk walk walk walk
Walk walk walk walk
I gotta keep moving, I won’t stop
Keep on walking, watch out
Here I’m coming

[Bridge]
Sitting and waiting
For better days
Or facing the battle
And fight for a change
I’ve made my decision
It’s clearing the haze
In times when I fail
I’m taking the pain
I’m on my way

[Chorus]
Walk!
I’m fighting and I’m bleeding
I don’t give up, I walk
My hope, my love, my reason
They guide me as I walk
Like Hannibal over the mountains
I gotta keep moving, I won’t stop
Keep on walking, watch out
Here I’m coming
Walk walk walk walk
Walk walk walk walk
Walk walk walk walk
I gotta keep moving, I won’t stop
Keep on walking, watch out
Here I’m coming1Embed Walk Seeing Red Saint Chaos;Sam Tinnesz alt-rock
