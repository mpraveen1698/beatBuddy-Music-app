25 ContributorsIn the Army Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
A Vacation in a foreign land
Uncle Sam does the best he can
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

[Verse 2]
Now you remember what the draft man said
Nothing to do all day but stay in bed
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

[Verse 3]
You'll be the hero of the neighborhood
Nobody knows that you left for good
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

[Verse 4]
Smiling faces as you wait to land
But once you get there no one gives a damn
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

[Verse 5]
Hand grenades flying over your head
Missiles flyin' over your head, if you wanna survive
Get out of bed
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army, now

Shots ring out in the dead of night
The sergeant calls: "Stand up and fight!"
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

[Verse 7]
You got your orders better shoot on sight
Your finger's on the trigger but it don't seem right
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 8]
Night is falling and you just can't see
Is this illusion or reality
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - in the army now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now
[Outro]
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - in the army now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

Oh, oh you're in the army - in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - in the army now2Embed In The Army Now In The Army Now Status Quo blues
