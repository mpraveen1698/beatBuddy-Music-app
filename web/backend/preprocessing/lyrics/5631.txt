No high better than you, easy
I'm tripping over my own tongue
Lie!
Desire, like an illness, chokes me
You lit me up so smoke me now !

You made it so obvious that you're not in love
You never gave a damn bout us cos you're not in love

No time to regret this, what we've done
Still I second guess it, cold feet
I'm tripping over my own tongue
Lie!
Love has been and gone and now I'm numb

You made it so obvious that you're not in love
You never gave a damn bout us cos you're not in love

Rolling down into the wildest dream
You sent my soul downstreamSee Maribou State LiveGet tickets as low as $1062Embed Tongue Tongue EP Maribou State;Holly Walker indie
