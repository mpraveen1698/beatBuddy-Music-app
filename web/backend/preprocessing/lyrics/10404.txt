3 Contributors​​feel the same Lyrics[Verse 1]
Maybe this is heaven
Or maybe that’s just you
But I don’t trust my judgement
‘Cuz I’m just 22
My mind is running circles
My heart’s out in the rain
I know that this is sudden but

[Chorus]
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

[Verse 2]
I can’t make my mind up
I don’t know what to do
I’m trying to be honest
See all the point of views
You tell me that you’re leaving
But I wish you would stay
I think this is worth it but

[Chorus]
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?
You might also like[Bridge]
So if you’re thinking “not today”
I’d rather have the truth than start a love that’s fake
Baby, tell me if you need your space
But if you’re feeling lonely, I’m an hour away, hey

[Chorus]
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?Embed feel the same summer nights The Millennial Club chill
