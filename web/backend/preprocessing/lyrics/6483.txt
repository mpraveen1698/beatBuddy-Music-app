Babe, ain't no denying
That I've got you in my head
Girl, I'd be flying
If you stood yourself and said

[Chorus]
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I had
So come on back to me

[Verse 2]
Babe, you're so young and pretty
But you're evil, you oughta know
Darling, ain't that a pity
Won't you stand yourself and show

[Chorus]
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I had
So come on back to me
Yeah
