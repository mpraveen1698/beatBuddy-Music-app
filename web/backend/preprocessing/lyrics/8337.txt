18 ContributorsIn For The Kill Lyrics[Verse 1]
We can fight our desires
(Ooh) But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot
(Ooh) Whether we like it or not
They say we can love who we trust
(Ooh) But what is love without lust?
Two hearts with accurate devotions
(Ooh) What are feelings without emotions?

[Chorus]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Verse 2]
I hang my hopes out on the line
(Ooh) Well they'd be ready for you in time
If you leave them out too long
(Ooh) They'll be withered by the sun
Full stops and exclamation marks (Ah-ah)
(Ooh) My words stumble before I start
How far can you send emotions? (Ooh-ooh)
(Ooh) Can this bridge cross the ocean?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Bridge]
Let's go to war to make peace
Let's be cold to create heat
I hope in darkness we can see
And you're not blinded by the light from me

[Interlude]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand1Embed In For The Kill La Roux La Roux synth-pop
