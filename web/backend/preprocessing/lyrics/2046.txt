22 ContributorsWant You Bad Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you could only read my mind
You would know that things between us ain't right
I know your arms are open wide
But you're a little on the straight side, I can't lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Your one vice
Is you're too nice
Come around now, can't you see?

[Chorus]
I want you all tattooed
I want you bad
Complete me, mistreat me
I want you to be bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

[Verse 2]
If you could only read my mind
You would know that I've been waiting so long
For someone almost just like you
But with attitude, I'm waiting, so come on

[Pre-Chorus]
Get out of Clothestime
Grow out those highlights
Come around now, can't you see?

I want you in a vinyl suit
I want you bad
Complicated, X-rated
I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad

[Bridge]
Don't get me wrong
I know you're only being good
But that's what's wrong
I guess I just misunderstood

[Chorus]
I want you all tattooed
I want you bad
Complicated, X-rated
I want you bad

[Outro]
I mean it, I need it
I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, really, really bad4Embed Want You Bad Conspiracy Of One The Offspring punk
