I wanna feel your heart
Nothing can tear us apart

[Verse 1]
I want you to love me
No matter what I do, my heart is here for you, hmm
I need you to hold me
Even the sky's not blue

[Pre-Chorus]
Thriving with you, ooh
Winners of love
Higher with you
You are all I dreamed of

[Chorus]
I wanna feel your heart
Nothing can tear us apart

[Verse 2]
I'll love you forever
Never forget this truth, I'm always here for you
And I'll be wholehearted
I'll always follow you, hmm

Nothing can tear us apart
Nothing can tear us apart

I wanna feel your heart
Nothing can tear us apart
