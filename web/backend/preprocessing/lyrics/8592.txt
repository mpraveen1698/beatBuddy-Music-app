23 ContributorsAll Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
We always dreamed about this better life, this better life
We always felt it coming all along, yeah, all along
We got the keys to open paradise, yeah, paradise
Now let’s go walking hand in hand

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, we can hit the lights
Make the wrongs turn right
We can smash the clock
Make the pop go rock
With a love this deep
We don't need no sleep
And it feels like
We could do this all night

[Refrain]
We could do this all night
Yeah, everything is alright
We got the keys to open paradise, yeah, paradise
It feels like
We could do this all night

[Drop]
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
We could do this all night
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
