I will be your dentist
Go off, DTM
First date, I was talking my game
And she was with it
Had her smiling when the second one came
She catching feelings
By the third date, I took her breath away
She sat there giggling
At the end, I got nothing else to say

[Chorus]
I got a shawty and she bad
Miss get to the bag
Thrill seeker, she just wanna move it fast
And my shawty, she bad
On cam, throw it back
Get that bread by any means
Shake that ass, 'cause my shawty, she bad
She finesse with the cash
Got them other folks fiendin' for her mad
Reel it in, she got a catch
No cap, no cap
Bitch, she lovin' all the ways that I act
Got a shawty and she bad

She on a high when we together, enter hyperdrive
She caught a big vibe, this time, been like
How I be spittin', wanna sit by and lie all times
Right there beside me like right now
Come down, baby, leg's battle
Everyone pipe down, they out
No one could handle, she like the star now
She been the center attention
Soon as I pop out, it ain't no regular visit
She live the fast life, fast life, she don't wanna leave it
When it's the pastime, pastime, she goin' out drinkin'
She got them big dreams, she living life like she mean it
Before she's six feet under, she live like a demon

[Chorus]
'Cause she bad
Miss get to the bag
Thrill seeker, she just wanna move it fast
And my shawty, she bad
On cam, throw it back
Get that bread by any means
Shake that ass, 'cause my shawty, she bad
She finesse with the cash
Got them other folks fiendin' for her mad
Reel it in, she got a catch
No cap, no cap
Bitch, she lovin' all the ways that I act
Got a shawty and sheâ€”Embed She Bad She Bad Khantrast anime
