19 ContributorsRomance Garbage Lyrics[Intro]
Uber to my house, tell me how you feel
Everything safe, this ain't real
Fuckin' with this girl, she real chill
Fuckin' with this girl, not a big—
(Motherfucking Dyan D)

[Chorus]
You can listen to this song if you want to
You can Uber to my house if you want to
You can call me when you feeling all alone too
And I promise I will always be beside you
You can listen to this song if you want to
You can Uber to my house if you want to
You can call me when you feeling all alone too
And I promise I will always be beside you

[Verse 1]
I can understand that he did you wrong
Cuts on yo' wrist and you feeling so alone
Money in my pocket and I got on VLONE
All my bitches fake and they actin' like some clones, yeah

[Interlude]
Wanna die today, how you feel today?
Wanna die today, how you feel today?
I fuckin' feel about you
この間のすき焼き先生食べた？
食い物は粗末にいないんだ、俺わ...
