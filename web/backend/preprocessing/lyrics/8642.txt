18 ContributorsStarlight (Keep Me Afloat) Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I have to go
Please don't tell me when
Need a little more time
I hope you understand

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a guardian, you're watching over me
Through the depths of my own despair
I look up to the sky and I find my peace
I know you'll be there, so

[Chorus]
Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat
If I ever drift away, would you be there?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat
Till the end of time, make me feel safe
Oh, I just need you nеxt to me
Starlight, won't you lead the way down this rivеr?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

[Drop]
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

[Verse 2]
I see you through the clouds
I feel you when it rains
You never walk out
Even on my darkest days
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Like a guardian, you're watching over me
Through the depths of my own despair
I look up to the sky and I find my peace
I know you'll be there, so

[Chorus]
Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat
If I ever drift away, would you be there?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat
Till the end of time, make me feel safe
Oh, I just need you next to me
Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

[Bridge]
Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

[Drop]
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, woo, ooh
Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat4Embed Starlight (Keep Me Afloat) Starlight (Keep Me Afloat) Martin Garrix;DubVision;Shaun Farrugia progressive-house
