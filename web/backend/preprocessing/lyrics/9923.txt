6 ContributorsWanted Man Lyrics[Chorus]
I ain't old Butch Cassidy or Sundance Kid
But I stole your heart with a just one kiss
You were there by my side when the only reward
Was ridin' shotgun in that Honda Accord
You're my partner in crime when you take my hand
You make me feel like, a wanted man

[Verse 1]
I remember that night that you killed me
One shot to my heart and I'm guilty
Of falling for you, hardcore
Made a getaway out through the back door
Caught your eyes from across the room
And every boy's tryna catch them too
Played it off like I was alright
But that look locked up my whole life
Like I committed a crime
And I was ready to do the time

[Chorus]
I ain't old Butch Cassidy or Sundance Kid
But I stole your heart with a just one kiss
You were there by my side when the only reward
Was ridin' shotgun in that Honda Accord
You're my partner in crime when you take my hand
You make me feel like, a wanted man

We could ride off into the sunset
Or just lie on the couch watching Netflix
Don't really mind, dead or alive
Love feeling like this should be a crime
And I'm ready to do the time

[Chorus]
I ain't old Butch Cassidy or Sundance Kid
But I stole your heart with a just one kiss
You were there by my side when the only reward
Was ridin' shotgun in that Honda Accord
You're my partner in crime when you take my hand
You make me feel like, a wanted man
You make me feel like, a wanted man

[Chorus]
I ain't old Butch Cassidy or Sundance Kid
But I stole your heart with a just one kiss
You were there by my side when the only reward
Was ridin' shotgun in that Honda Accord
You're my partner in crime when you take my hand
You make me feel like, a wanted man
You make me feel like, a wanted man
You make me feel like, a wanted man
You make me feel like, a wanted man
You make me feel like, a wanted manEmbed Wanted Man CRAZYTALK Mat Kearney acoustic
