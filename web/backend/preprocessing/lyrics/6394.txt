15 ContributorsBetter Than Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think you can do much better than me
After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I told myself I won’t miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

[Chorus]
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

[Verse 2]
While lookin’ through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were lookin’ for
If there’s one memory I don’t wanna lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room

But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

[Chorus]
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

[Bridge]
The bed I’m lyin’ is getting colder
Wish I never would’ve said it’s over
And I can’t pretend
I won’t think about you when I’m older
Cause we never really had our closure
This can’t be the end

[Chorus]
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
[Outro]
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
And I think you should know this7Embed Better Than Me Extreme Behavior Hinder grunge
