26 ContributorsEast of Eden Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pink toes pressed against the carpet
Show your face and finish what you started
The record spins down the alley, late night
Be my friend, surround me like a satellite

[Pre-Chorus]
Tiger on the prowl, east of Eden
Coming for you now

[Chorus]
Keep me from the cages under the control
Runnin' in the dark to find east of Eden
Keep me from the cages under the control
Runnin' in the dark to find east of Eden
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Call me wild, drinkin' up the sunshine
Be my man and show me what it feels like
Denim sky unbuttoned down the middle
Spillin' out little by little
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Tiger on the prowl, east of Eden
Coming for you now

[Chorus]
Keep me from the cages under the control
Runnin' in the dark to find east of Eden
Keep me from the cages under the control
Runnin' in the dark to find east of Eden
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)

[Bridge]
If I wanted to stay, you don't mind
You're a true believer (True believer)
Take it up with the badlands
Creep on in like a concrete fever
If I wanted to stay, you don't mind
You're a true believer (True believer)
Take it up with the badlands
Creep on in like a concrete fever

[Chorus]
Keep me from the cages under the control
Runnin' in the dark to find east of Eden
Keep me from the cages under the control
Runnin' in the dark to find east of Eden
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)14Embed East of Eden Kicker Zella Day indie-pop
