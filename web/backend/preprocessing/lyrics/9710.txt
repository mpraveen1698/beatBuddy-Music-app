With eyes wide shut we lay stagnant awake
Safe for now in this wonderous state
Lost at a crossroad that's missing a sign
How do we know if they made it alive
There's something lurking in the distance ahead
Fragments of light shine away from the dead
They fantasize fury, no time left to stop
Its darkness approaching now we're at a loss

[Chorus](x2)
Sometimes, when all that's lost remains
Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
Sometimes we jump across to every cloud
Fly away get lost and never be found

[Verse 2]
There's something lurking from the shadows within
Stealing the colour and life from my skin
They fantasize fury at no extra cost
Darkness approaches now we're at a loss

[Bridge](x2)
Ah

[Chorus](x2)
