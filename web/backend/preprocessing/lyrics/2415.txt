15 ContributorsSOMEBODY Lyrics[Verse 1]
Baby, why the hesitation?
'Cause I know that you can feel it too
You want more and I can taste it
Let me show you what I wanna do
Tryna get trapped in your leg lock
Go another round, make the bed rock
Yuh, bite the neck, I'ma make it sweat
Never give you no rest, never give you no rest

[Pre-Chorus]
You needed somebody, baby, put it on me
I can be that body, said I can be that body
You needed somebody, baby, put it on me
I can be that body, said I can be that, no

[Chorus]
Baby, it’s you, baby, it’s you
(Fuck around, put you down, get it loud, 'nother round)
Baby, it’s you
(You needed somebody, baby, put it on me)
Tell me where you want, te—tell me where you want it
Baby, it’s you, baby, it’s you
(Fuck around, put you down, get it loud, 'nother round)
Baby, it’s you
(You needed somebody, baby, put it on me)
Tell me where you want, te—tell me where you want it

Back it up, girl, now you speakin' my language
Show me your favorite spots, but you don’t gotta say it
(Pull me close, hold it tight, let me go through the night)
Saddle up girl, why you keepin' me waitin'?
Hold on if you wanna get off
If you want love, we gon' make it
(Love, we gon' make— lo—lo—love, we gon' make i—it)

[Pre-Chorus]
You needed somebody, baby, put it on me
I can be that body, said I can be that body
You needed somebody, baby, put it on me
I can be that body, said I can be that, no

[Chorus]
Baby, it’s you, baby, it’s you
(Fuck around, put you down, get it loud, 'nother round)
Baby, it’s you
(You needed somebody, baby, put it on me)
Tell me where you want, te—tell me where you want it
Baby, it’s you (keshi), baby, it’s you
(Fuck around, put you down, get it loud, 'nother round)
Baby, it’s you
(You needed somebody, baby, put it on me)
Tell me where you want, te—tell me where you want it
