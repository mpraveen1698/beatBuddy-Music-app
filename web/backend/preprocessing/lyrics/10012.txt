1 ContributorEasy Lyrics[Intro]
Gimme, gimme what I need
'Cause all I need is everything
It's so, it's so easy
It's so, it's so easy

[Verse]
It's not about diamonds and gold, they come and go
I've seen it all, stories get told, whenever you go

[Chorus]
Yeah, you don't know what you got until it's too late
But you won't know if you got it until you give it away
You'll never know what you could hold if you don't let go

[Pre-Drop]
Gimme, gimme what I need
'Cause all I need is everything
It's so, it's so easy
It's so, it's so easy
No, we don't need no sympathy
'Cause we can touch infinity
It's so, it's so easy
It's so, it's so easy

[Drop]
Gimme, gimme what I need
'Cause all I need is everything
It's so, it's so easy
It's so, it's so easy
No, we don't need no sympathy
'Cause wе can touch infinity
It's so, it's so easy
It's so, it's so easy

This ain't no goodbye, goodbye
Keep losing control, hit bumps in the road
Who cares where we go?

Yeah, you don't know what you got until it's too late
But you won't know if you got it until you give it away
You'll never know what you could hold if you don't let go
