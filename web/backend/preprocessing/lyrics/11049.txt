14 ContributorsThe Negative Lyrics[Intro: Brian Burkheiser]
I'm so sick and tired of the negative

[Verse 1: Brian Burkheiser]
I’m on the edge tonight
Closer to the ledge, you were right
Lost in my head tonight
Lost in my head tonight
I'm spinning in circles and I can't get out
Running from these thoughts that I can’t say out loud

[Verse 2: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Well, damn, I guess you're the perfect person
Same day but a different version
Paint the picture but you don't deserve it
Color's fading underneath the surface
So wear black everywhеre you go
No take backs at the еnd of the road
No last chance when the casket's closed
Your silence is worth more than gold

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
I'm so sick and tired of the negative
Black and white, you're right
I'm fucking over it
Patience is paper thin
And something’s gotta give
I’m so sick and tired of the negative

Time is running out
It's inescapable
Staring at the walls
Feel like an animal
You can’t escape
You can't escape
You think I'm locked in here with you
You're here with me
And no one leaves
Time is running out
It’s inescapable

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
I'm so sick and tired of the negative
Black and white, you're right
I'm fucking over it
Patience is paper thin
And something's gotta give
I'm so sick and tired of the negative
'Cause all my life I never knew
Why my mind is turning black, turning blue
But now I know
That colors don't bleed the same between me and you

[Breakdown: Eric Vanlerberghe]
I've watched the whole world go insane
They convinced me I'm addicted to the pain
I need it
Like a moth drawn to a flame
We're too fucked up to be saved
So go insane
Like a moth drawn to a flame
We're too fucked up to be saved
[Outro: Brian Burkheiser]
I'm so sick and tired of the negative
Black and white, you're right
I'm fucking over itEmbed The Negative TRUE POWER I Prevail metalcore
