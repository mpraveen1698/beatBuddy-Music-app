(Won't you get out of my head?)
(Electrify my golden tooth)

[Verse 1]
Forget it, I'll do it sometime, ooh
I'm locked up on the button
Can't you do it sometime?
Pushed it in too far, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Fine, electrify mine, oh
Electrify my golden tooth
Can't look at your eyes
Without sparking some...

[Chorus]
Electrify my heart-art-art-art-art-art-oh-ooh-ooh
Electrify my heart-art-art-art-art-art-oh-ooh-ooh
(Yeah, haha)

[Verse 2]
(Yeah)
Surprise, I'm in the same time, o-ah
Beneath the same sun (Oh, yeah)
Oh, man, you cut me to size (Ow)
My little buttercup (That hurt)
