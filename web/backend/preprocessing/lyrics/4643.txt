Oh, ooh, no
I can't give a nigga my trust
Ayy, oh
Ayy, oh, oh no
Yeah (Ayy)
Oh
Ayy, yeah
Ayy, ayy

[Verse]
I been tellin' niggas lies (Yeah)
Try to split up all my time (Yeah)
With two or three guys (Yeah)
'Cause I can't make up my mind, I know
I'm so indecisive (Ayy, yeah)
And I know that you don't like it (Ayy, uh huh)
And I never let my guard down (Ayy)
But you steady tryna wife it, oh no (Ayy)
Don't you see that I got baggage?
My heart's way too hard to manage, oh no
I can't give a nigga my trust (I can't)
Said you workin' to change that, but just

[Chorus]
Bare with me (Bare, bare, bare)
You gotta bare with me (Bare, bare, bare)
Oh, bare wit me, oh (Bare, bare, bare)
Baby, just (Ayy), oh, just (Ayy)
Bare with me (Bare with me, bare with me, bare)
You gotta bare with me (Bare with me, bare with me, bare)
Oh, bare with me, yeah (Bare with me, bare with me, bare)
Baby, just (Ayy), just (Ayy)

Niggas, niggas, niggas wrapped around a finger
I don't think I get it (I don't think I get it)
If you was in the picture, maybe I would listen
Time I wish I didn't
Memory started
Bare with me through heartbreaks
Bare with me through long days
Bare with me, don't part ways
Niggas, niggas, niggas wrapped around a finger
I don't think I get it4Embed Bare Wit Me The Album Teyana Taylor soul
