5 ContributorsNeva Again LyricsI don't know where to start, I don't know how to start
I don't where to begin, fuck it I'm going straight in
I guess you mad because I choose the beats over the streets
Shit ain't the same homie, thought you was my main homie
You put dirt on my name homie, got with niggas and changed on me
I keep that thang on me, better stay in your lane homie
Shit been going crazy since I started buzzin
I ain't expect this shit from my cousin, it's like
When I was at the bottom you was going hard to me
Now I'm on top and you don't even talk to me
I started getting shows for 2500 a piece
And choppin it up, making sure all of us eat
You don't want the best for me, you rather see me in jail or decease
You went that way cuz you wanted to, I fuck with you fuck nigga tell the truth
You pose to be right here with BGE, you pose to be with me ridin in the coupe
Niggas that I slicked? How?
On social sites talking foul
Saying how they gon do this and that
Saying shit they ain't bout
Saying how I'm unloyal, saying how I ain't keep it real
I'm the one to put you in position to make money, how I ain't keep it real?
Saying how they made money, saying how they don't fuck with him
Shit nigga, if it's that easy, then let me see you make another one
Fronted me, I curved em, I was leaking I was hurtin'
Now I'm foreign whips swerving, coming thru the Jackson no Curtis
Niggas ain't trustworthy, on the real steal from they friends
A bitch fucked me over, broke my heart and I told myself never again
You might also likeSee, a nigga like me done been through shit and gon' go through shit
It's just how you gon' overcome that shit
See, I emerged from the mud, from the struggle
From the bottom for real
I put my heart and my soul into this shit here
I done dreamed and dreamed and wished and prayed
I get to the position I'm in today
See I done fucked over and been fucked over

It's bad, what's up with you my nigga
It's sad, it's coming from you my nigga
You rooting for niggas that won't even give you a dime
I put in my effort and time to grind and shine
Niggas form my hood trippin'
But I'm still walking home, Tennessee with me
Niggas really in they feelings
Cuz I fuck with Gotti and big homie fuck with me
But it's still Bread Gang and CMG
But it's still Bread Gang and CMG

I don't know where a nigga begin
It's like the richer I get I'm losing my friends
You gotta watch these hoes, they some liars and then
Lay up with you, pretend and then fuck your friend
