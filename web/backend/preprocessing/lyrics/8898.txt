16 ContributorsColourway Lyrics[Verse 1]
I’m breathing black and white, let it fool
Caught by your linen eyes, let them fool

[Chorus]
But I don’t know where we went,
my dear don’t unfold me and call it all pretend,
be here and be holy
I don’t know where we went
my dear don’t unfold me
I’m coloured in again, in you

[Verse 2]
Green where my red love lies, was it all?
Don’t wear your winning prize, let it fool

[Chorus]
But I don’t know where we went,
my dear don’t unfold me and call it all pretend,
be here and be holy
I don’t know where we went
my dear don’t unfold me
I’m coloured in again, in you

[Outro]
oh, what a waste, I’ll be locked in your heaven, always
oh, what a way to be living with all of your pain
oh, what a way to be locking your heaven away
oh, what a wave you have made.See Novo Amor LiveGet tickets as low as $414Embed Colourway Bathing Beach Novo Amor folk
