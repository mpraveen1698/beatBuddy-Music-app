16 ContributorsChanges Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been going through the motions
Learning how to pretend
That everything is perfect
And I've been sinking in an ocean
Drowning but I'm silent
Yet everyone thinks I'm afloat

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm running through mazes, mazes
Maybe it's just a phase but regardless
I'm flipping the pages, pages

[Chorus]
I'm going through changes
But I swear I'm the same
Could you show me some patience
Along the way?
I'm going through changes
But I swear I'm the same
Could you show me some mercy
If I start to stray?

[Verse 2]
I've been chasing aftеr feelings
Most of which are fleeting
I still feel empty
And I've been trying hard to fit in
But how comе I'm so different
From everyone I see?

I'm running through mazes, mazes
Maybe it's just a phase but regardless
I'm flipping the pages, pages

[Chorus]
I'm going through changes
But I swear I'm the same
Could you show me some patience
Along the way?
I'm going through changes
But I swear I'm the same
Could you show me some mercy
If I start to stray?

[Outro]
Trying to fight the seasons
Trying to find my meaning
Maybe there's a reason
Why I'm going through these changes7Embed Changes Changes - EP Hayd singer-songwriter
