19 ContributorsBy the Sword Lyrics[Intro]
Bitch, I got some buzzards clawin' at my fuckin' stomach (Fuckin' stomach)
I'm from the shadows, left the gallows, made the summit (Made the summit)
Hear the trumpets rollin' in like it's '300'
Let the battle feel ravaged, attack
And then we stack the bodies up

[Hook]
Yeah, bitch, I got some buzzards clawin' at my fuckin' stomach (Fuckin' stomach)
I'm from the shadows, left the gallows, made the summit (Made the summit)
Hear the trumpets rollin' in like it's '300'
Let the battle feel ravaged, attack
And then we stack the bodies up

[Verse]
Moon light shinin' off the armor that I'm 'bout to rip (I'm bout to rip)
Got no time to waste, so don't worry, I'll make it quick (I'll make it quick)
Your death will be glorious, I'm emergin' victorious
Name is reignin' notorious, but this isn't where the story ends
There's no turning back now, just fire in the background
The spires overlook the bloody night, it's in the past now
But it's time, the grudge that I been holdin' is brewin' awfully potent
My shoulders shrug, I've had enough, I guess your time is up
Okay, my blade is itchin', ready up now, I smell the fear
This is where it ends, don't look around, there's no one for you here
It's just you and me
So motherfucker are you feelin lucky?
What's it gonna be? Tell me, what's it gonna be?
Kill, my blade stained, plain face
Say my fuckin' name
As my blood runs black, you can tell we're not the same
See the fire in the sky and embrace of the storm
'Cause I live by the sword, and I'll die by the fuckin' sword

Bury me-
Six feet deep, with steel around my flesh (My flesh)
By the sword and laid to rest
The stains turn into nightmares13Embed By the Sword By the Sword iamjakehill sad
