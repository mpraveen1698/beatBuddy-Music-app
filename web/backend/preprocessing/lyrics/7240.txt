48 ContributorsBars No Jutsu Lyrics[Intro]
Hmm, taha goddammit dude
Yo this is for the weebs out there

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh god, yeah this couldn't be hotter
No hate, yeah you really don't gotta
One bar and I'm ending all the drama
Punch lines hitting like Saitama

[Chorus]
You're a Titan, I wonder who's next
Slicing their nape like I did to the rest
Top of the team in the scout regiment
You really want it then prepare to get bent
You're the Uchiha, I am Itachi
Only another Sharingan can stop me
I'm the original, you are a copy
Shadow-clone jutsu but your's lookin' floppy
Japanese could use a little bit of practice
Watched one show but I couldn't quite crack it
Full metal lookin pretty fuckin' savage
And if you disagree, catch this full metal jacket
All talk but that's really okay though
Wanna settle it, let's hop on SAO
Tai Lee got me acting so loco
But I'm Iroh when I'm spittin that fuego
You might also like[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm legendary like Ho-oh
Uh, and I got stans like JoJo
I'm made in heaven and I'm bumpin' every time zone
Using all the lyrics manipulating the time flow
Yeah, I'm on the hunt like Zoro
But I don't even think I really need a sword though
I'm Kirito on the 74th floor ho
Doin' with the beats and the bars from the start yo
Haters think they're tough like Dorochio
But it's all a facade and it's well known
Solo my flow goes so Bozo lookin like Roy Mustang in a wet coat
I go where the hype goes
Flight mode type flow when I write those
Just know I'm a man that you don't quote
If your name's in my mouth, it's better off in a Death Note

[Verse 2]
From the west to the east I tell
Beast that weebs don't sleep cause binging ain't easy
Completely lost in that series
Secretly hoping that no one sees me
So please its not what it seems
The life that they live it's just what I'm needing
And if I could just shoot a bright beam and see my enemies defeated by me, jeez
Run it back cause I'm proud of that Zenitsu when he takes a nap I'm always on attack
And that's a promise you can count on that, if your playin' with lightning then expect to zap
And in this habitat I'm like an acrobat I got Odie in here I gotta thank for that
Made an artifact, out of the sake of rap and I'll be damned if anybody gonna take it back
[Verse 3]
Cause, Imma leave them all with trauma
Imma leave them crying running back to mama
Cause it's hardly common, I'm as smart as Bulma
I got firsts face your face like a Toga
And y'all know it couldn't be hotter
No hate or weâ€™ll leave you in a gutter
One bar and i'm raking in the commas
Motherfuckin' punch lines hitting like Saitama

[Chorus]
You're a Titan, I wonder who's next
Slicing their nape like I did to the rest
Top of the team in the scout regiment
You really want it then prepare to get bent
You're the Uchiha, I am Itachi
Only another Sharingan can stop me
I'm the original you are a copy
Shadow-clone jutsu but your's lookin' floppy
Japanese could use a little bit of practice
Watched one show but I couldn't quite crack it
Full metal lookin pretty fuckin' savage
