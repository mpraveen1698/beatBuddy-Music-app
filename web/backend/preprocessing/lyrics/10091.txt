16 ContributorsGrow Old with Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can feel you breathing
With your hair on my skin
As we lie here within the night
I'll pull the sheets
When it's cold on your feet
'Cause you'll fall back to sleep every time

[Chorus]
Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I (Ooh-oh, ooh-oh)

[Verse 2]
And our hands, they might age
And our bodies will change
But we'll still be the same as we are
We'll still sing our song (Ooh-oh)
When our hair ain't so blonde (Ooh-oh)
And our children have sung, we were right (Oh)

[Chorus]
They'll sing "Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I" (Ooh-oh, ooh-oh)

And the hairs, they stand up
And my feet start to thump
Yeah, the feeling is dreamin' around
You'll be the one
Make me hurt, make me come
Make me feel like I'm real and alive

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh, and a-one, two, three, four!)

[Chorus]
Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I
Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I
