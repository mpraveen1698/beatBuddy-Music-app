A hypochondriac
I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack (I'm using my imagination)

[Chorus]
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me bugging hеr last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smartеr to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask—

[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm laced with poison, I can't escape the rush
This ain't love, boy, you're just a pick-me-up
And the gaze Medusa, locks rattlesnakes, debuffed
No need to purchase my soul, girl, I'll just give it up
I'm like "God damn," she slid in, now we're breaking the ice
The concoction just hit me, it's dilating my eyes
Fuck my options, she pulled me in, she didn't even try
I was hypnotized soon as her lips met mine, I can't forget
You might also like[Chorus]
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask me
My corpse is spillin' blood in the backseat
She's undercover, got a Trojan to crash me
Leave a scar on my soul, seein' stars in the road
I take it better when she don't even ask me

[Verse 2]
She got this on repeat
I'm obsessive as her, she obsessive as me (Yeah)
Laments turn me to stone, and her curves got me weak
She wan' get us alone, I can tell she a freak
It be like, oh no, she invited me to a pity party
But go home and hope you ain't leavin' with nobody
But fate sewn, she'll take me back to her place
Can't say this shit to her face or make up my mind, I can't forget
[Refrain]
A hypochondriac
I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack
The things I do to see you smile
[Verse 3]
Yeah, I know I made my art entertainment
Carbon to coal, now my card can't decline and it costs my control
I'll let God integrate, but until then I gotta give in to you, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
(Stop crying on the dance floor)
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
(Shit rhyme, I had no plan for it)
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
(I'm on top the c—)
I take it better when she don't even ask me
(I'm on top the c—)
My corpse is spillin' blood in the backseat
(Stop crying on the dance floor)
She's undercover, got a Trojan to crash me
(I'm on top the c—)
Leave a scar on my soul, seein' stars in the road
(I'm on top the c—)
I take it better when she don't even ask
[Bridge]
Don't even ask (Fall deep)
Then we vaporized 'til our fates aligned
I think we frayed the twine
Tethering space and time, I can't forget

[Interlude]
Into this trance
Your mind is programmed to drift on these words
Use my voice in your head as a thread to your heart
All that pain you're carrying, all that regret (She knows)
I can remove it, all you have to do is let me (She grows, she grows)

[Outro]
She grows through my throat and my chest
My tears were glowing just to muffle the screaming out
(Only remember you love me) Hi-Fi
Stuck in amber and honey
My headache split wide awake
I'll hide the pain for you
Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, no (No)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, no, no, no, no (You left me nauseous)20Embed venus fly trap venus fly trap brakence emo
