12 ContributorsSpooky Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the cool of the evening when everything is gettin' kind of groovy
You call me up and ask me would I like to go with you and see a movie
First I say, "No, I've got some plans for the night," and then I stop
And say, "Alright"
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

[Verse 2]
You always keep me guessin', I never seem to know what you are thinkin'
And if a girl looks at you it's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin'
I get confused, I never know where I stand, and then you smile
And hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky

[Verse 3]
If you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's been a-dyin' to be sayin'
Just like a ghost you've been a-hauntin' my dreams, but now I know
You're not what you seem
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

[Outro]
Spooky, yeah
Ah, spooky
Mmm, spooky
Ah, ah, ah, spooky
Ooh, spooky, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, spookyYou might also like5Embed Spooky Dusty... Definitely Dusty Springfield british
