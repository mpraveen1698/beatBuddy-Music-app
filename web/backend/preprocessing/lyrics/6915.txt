One little finger, one little finger
One little finger, tap-tap-tap
Point your finger up
Point your finger down
Put it on your head, head!

[Verse 2]
One little finger, one little finger
One little finger, tap-tap-tap
Point your finger up
Point your finger down
Put it on your nose, nose!

[Verse 3]
One little finger, one little finger
One little finger, tap-tap-tap
Point your finger up
Point your finger down
Put it on your chin, chin!

[Verse 4]
One little finger, one little fingеr
One little finger, tap-tap-tap
Point your fingеr up
Point your finger down
Put it on your arm, arm!

Put it on your head, head!
