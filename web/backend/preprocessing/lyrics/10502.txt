19 ContributorsAre You Okay? Lyrics[Chorus: Thomas Reid]
You already know my words
Before I speak
You already know my heart
Feels so weak without you

[Verse 1: Rxseboy]
I was out here for a minute on my lonely
You were doing drugs in your room feeling broken
Told me, you were having trouble staying focused
Got with the wrong crowd, thought you could open up
Backfired, you were eighteen
Every memory turning into a daydream
Zoning out
What's that about? you won’t tell me
Lied to my face when you said you were healthy
I never said 'leave'
I begged you to stay
Every other day said you wanna go away
Putting food on your plate
Then it switched to a platter
You looked in my eyes said it didn’t even matter
Used to stay home, watch a movie on the couch
Now you all alone wit a pill in your mouth
Take a sip of the alc' while you thinking of me
Envisioning every single thing that we never could be
You might also like[Chorus: Thomas Reid & Powfu]
You already know my words
Before I speak
Yeah, before I speak
Before I speak
You already know my heart (yeah)
Feels so weak without you
It feels so weak
It feels so weak

[Bridge: Thomas Reid]
Holding you
Holding you
Tighter
Hoping you stay
You stay with me
Holding you
Holding you
Tighter
Are you okay?

[Verse 2: Rxseboy]
Stressed out, blaming everyone around you
In the same boat, but I wouldn't call it Powfu
Everyday wanna make up, dunno how to
Said you stopped drinking again, girl I'm proud too
Get too high, I could bring you down
On a trip, hit you back when I'm back in town
We got two different lives
Two different vibes
Doing drugs, I don't, that's two different highs
Promised me I could hold you
Look at your scars, think I'm here with the old you
We were so young, living lavish with no rules
Now I’m doing work while you still getting homeschooled
Disappointed in us and I can’t lie
Disagreed when you said that we can't try
Know you said I’m a fool, girl am I?
Don't forget that I'm here on standby
[Verse 3: Powfu]
Yeah, I'm on standby
If you wanna talk you can pass by
Used to visit me at work all the damn time
When you leaving me on seen I’m a sad guy
Quit this shit I'll hate myself if I lose you
Pass the torch before the flames consume you
Tryna figure out a way, running out of options
(I'm trying to help you!)
Just stop this, please
Before it's too late
You don't think I'm serious I'll tat it on my face
You don't need drugs, be addicted to my love
Your friends never cared but I'm here to keep in touch
My parents still together and they met in the '70s
We don't gotta split be the couple of the century
Yuh feels like a movie but I'm still in love
When we offset
I've been thinking of you more even though we talk less
Sink in the sand
Always turn away when I offer you my hand
I see that you're hurting
Don't deserve it
Sitting in the dark, open up your curtains
I don't wanna see you die
I don't wanna be that guy that sits on the side
One step at a time
We'll take you one step at a time
[Chorus: Thomas Reid]
You already know my words
Before I speak
You already know my heart
Feels so weak without you13Embed Are You Okay? Are You Okay? Thomas Reid;Rxseboy;Powfu sad
