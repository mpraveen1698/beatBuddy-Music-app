10 ContributorsSpiralia Lyrics[Intro]
(Hey, Killstation)

[Chorus]
It's not safe outside at night
California has bad vibes
I got no sleep, lost my mind
I hope I'm dreaming this time

[Verse]
Dragging your feet now on the ground
You play to the beat, but it's way too loud
You're out in the street, they can see you now
If you're asking me, then you best leave town

[Chorus]
It's not safe outside at night
California has bad vibes
I got no sleep, lost my mind
I hope I'm dreaming this time
It's not safe outside at night
California has bad vibes
I got no sleep, lost my mind
I hope I'm dreaming this timeYou might also like9Embed Spiralia Spiralia Killstation emo
