Baby, be my bubblegum, I can be so troublesome
I just wanna love you some, you don’t gotta owe me nun'
Now I’m on the road doin' shows, that’s just how it go

Blowin' kisses like a blunt, baby girl, I'm tryna' stunt
You can be my number one, won’t you be my bubblegum? Yeah
Won't you be my bubblegum? AyyYou might also like15Embed Princess Bubblegum Princess Bubblegum ilyTOMMY sad
