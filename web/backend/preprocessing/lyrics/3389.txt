17 Contributors​i’m a mess Lyrics[Intro]
It is what it is
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh yeah (Niphkeys)
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm sad
I don't know what's over me
Sometimes I'm good, sometimes I'm wild
I don't know what's over me

[Chorus]
I don't know what's over me
I'm overthinking everything
At times, it feels like nobody
Can understand the way I feel
'Cause I am fucked up totally
I don't know how to keep company
So I've been drinking cognac
I've been drinking too many shots of cognac

[Post-Chorus]
One for the belly, another for the broken heart
Three for addiction, four so I don't go back
Looking for somebody wey fit watch my shoulders
So I can never bе sober
I can never bе so, oh, oh, oh
(I can never be so)

Oh, oh, yes, I did it
How many million I make for a living?
Wear my Louis Vuitton, post for the pic
Let the camera light hit my teeth, you know
Nobody's better than me
Nobody's better than me
I do it differently
Everybody can see

[Chorus]
I don't know what's over me
I'm overthinking everything
At times, it feels like nobody
Can understand the way I feel
'Cause I am fucked up totally
I don't know how to keep company
So I've been drinking cognac
I've been too many shots of cognac

[Post-Chorus]
One for the belly, another for the broken heart
Three for addiction, four so I don't go back
Looking for somebody wey fit watch my shoulders
So I can never be sober
(I can never be sober)
[Outro]
