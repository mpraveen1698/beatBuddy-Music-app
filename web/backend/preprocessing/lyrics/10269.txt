I lie awake
I've gone to ground
I'm watching porn
In my hotel dressing gown
And now I dream of you
But I still believe
There's only enough for one
In this lonely hotel suite

[Verse 2: Sia]
The journey's long
And I feel so bad
I'm thinking back to the last day we had

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Old moon fades into the new
Soon I know I'll be back with you
I'm nearly with you
I'm nearly with you

[Chorus: Sia & Sophie Barker]
When I'm weak I draw strength from you
And when you're lost I know how to change your mood
And when I'm down you breathe life over me
Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny
You might also like[Verse 3: Sia]
On a clear day
I'll fly home to you
I'm bending time
Getting back to you

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Old moon fades into the new
Soon I know I'll be back with you
I'm nearly with you
I'm nearly with you

[Chorus: Sia & Sophie Barker]
When I'm weak I draw strength from you
And when you're lost I know how to change your mood
And when I'm down you breathe life over me
Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny
When I'm weak I draw strength from you
And when you're lost I know how to change your mood
And when I'm down you breathe life over me
Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny

[Outro: Sia]
I'll fly, I'll fly home
I'll fly home and I'll fly home3Embed Destiny Simple Things Zero 7;Sia;Sophie Barker trip-hop
