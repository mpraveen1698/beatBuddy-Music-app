She is dangerous with me
A real freak, my baby
Stay by my side, stay right here by my side
Like my knife, hmm, look

[Chorus: Ricky Rich]
Hon är farlig (Habibi), helt olaglig (Habibi)
En riktig galning (Habibi), habibi (Aha)
Hon är tia (Habibi), som min nia (Habibi)
Mamacita (Habibi), habibi

[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie & Ricky Rich]
I can't even lie to you (Huh?)
Everything feels better when I'm inside of you
And I don't mean to bother you
But if we need it, she even the type to hold that fire for you
And none of my niggas play violins, they just like violence
I ain't even gotta tell 'em to say less for them to move in silencе
No shade, but I don't wanna hang around hoes that I won't save
I got morе paper
I like girls that go both ways
To get in my whip, it's a whole different weather
Baby, you can break my heart if I let you
Louis Vuitton, you can get your own section (Get your own section)
Head before and after we get to sexin' (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Ricky Rich]
Yeah, I give it all to you (You)
Baby, you my valentine ('Tine)
I can be a peer to boo (Ooh) the way that we sexercise
Girl, I like the way you walkin'
Can you talk to me, baby? Girl, I miss your talkin'
Don't walk on me, baby, walk on water
If you're a baller, I can be your Coach Carter, yeah
No shame, girl (Shame)
There's no way that they could change us
The same, girl
Three-six-fiver, yeah, we on vacation
Congratulations, we made it out of probation
Be patient, I'ma take you there

Hon är farlig (Habibi), helt olaglig (Habibi)
En riktig galning (Habibi), habibi (Aha)
Hon är tia (Habibi), som min nia (Habibi)
