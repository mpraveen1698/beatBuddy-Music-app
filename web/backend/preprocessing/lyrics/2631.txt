31 ContributorsJust Pretend Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not afraid
Of the war you've come to wage against my sins
I'm not okay
But I can try my best to just pretend

[Pre-Chorus]
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
(I have to let you go)

[Chorus]
I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you

[Verse 2]
I know the pain
That you hide behind the smile on your face
And not a day
Goes by where I don't think I feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?

I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you

[Post-Chorus]
We'll try again
When we're not so different
We will make amends
'Til then I'll just pretend

[Bridge]
Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?
Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?

[Chorus]
I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you

[Post-Chorus]
We'll try again
When we're not so different
We will make amends
'Til then I'll just pretend
[Outro]
(Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning)
(Way down, would you say I'm worthy?)
Weigh down on me, stay 'til morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?3Embed Just Pretend THE DEATH OF PEACE OF MIND Bad Omens metalcore
