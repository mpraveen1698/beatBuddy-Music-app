5 ContributorsCould I Love You Any More Lyrics[Intro: Reneé Dominique]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Reneé Dominique, Both]
Full moon, bedroom, stars in your eyes
Last night, the first time that I realized
The glow between us felt so right
We sat on the edge of the bed and you said
"I never knew that I could feel this way"
Love today can be so difficult
But what we have I know is different
'Cause when I'm with you the world stops turning

[Chorus: Both]
Could I love you any more?
Could I love you any more?
Could I love you any more?

[Verse 2: Jason Mraz, Both]
Sunrise, time flies, feels like a dream
Being close, inhaling, hard to believe
Seven billion people in the world
Finding you is like a miracle
Only this wonder remains
You might also like[Chorus: Both, Jason Mraz]
Could I love you any more?
Could I love you any more?
Could I love you any more?
Mmm

[Bridge: Reneé Dominique]
Softly, slowly
Love unfolding
Could this love be true?

[Chorus: Reneé Dominique]
Could I love you any more?
Could I love you any more?
Could I love you any more?

[Chorus: Reneé Dominique, (Jason Mraz)]
Could I love you any more? (The question's rhetorical)
Could I love you any more? (Oh, this feels phenomenal)
Could I love you any more? (Love is all there is)
Could I love you any more? (It's inexhaustible)
Could I love you any more? (Oh, love's unstoppable)
Could I love you any more? (Love is all there is)

[Bridge: Reneé Dominique, (Jason Mraz)]
Softly, slowly
Love unfolding
(Could this love be true?)
Could this love be true?
[Chorus: Reneé Dominique]
Could I love you any more?
Could I love you any more?
