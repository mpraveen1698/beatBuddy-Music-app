How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, but you're falling back down

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Trapped in a concept, falsely accused, misused
And misled, bitch, I'm hopin' you fuckin' rest in peace
Now the fact that I'm alone is fuckin' comfortin'
And I can't seem to shake this fuckin' feeling in my…
Uh
Cold shoulder, heartbroken, misspoken
I'm cut open, her fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could, she'd probably dance on my grave
Inside my head, I see your face, I fuckin' hate that I love you still
(Yeah)
(Down)

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Carry on, life flies so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, life flies so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, life flies so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Yeah
