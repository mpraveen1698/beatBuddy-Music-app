Ah
For now, I'll just let go
And ah
Run up the tab and lose control

[Pre-Chorus]
No, we ain't got plans like we had back then
Takes me back to how we used to feel

[Chorus]
We're goin' savage, we couldn't care less
No matter how hangover I get, I'll do it over again
Ravage, let's do some damage
And if I'm gettin' sober, then I will do it over again

[Build]
Do it over again, do it over again
Do it over again, do it over again
Do it over, do it over, do it over, do it over, do it over
Then I will do it over again

[Drop]

No, we ain't got plans like we had back then
Takes me back to how we used to feel

We're goin' savage, we couldn't care less
No matter how hangover I get, I'll do it over again
Ravage, let's do some damage
And if I'm gettin' sober, then I will do it over again

[Build]
Do it over again, do it over again
Do it over again, do it over again
Do it over, do it over, do it over, do it over, do it over
Then I will do it over again
