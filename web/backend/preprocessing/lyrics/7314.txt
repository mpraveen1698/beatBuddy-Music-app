9 ContributorsMeant to be Yours Lyrics[J.D., spoken]
All is forgiven baby!
Come on out and get dressed
You're my date to the pep rally tonight!

[VERONICA, spoken]
What!
Why?

[J.D., spoken]
Our classmates thought they were signing a petition
You gotta come out here and see what they really signed!

[J.D.]
You chucked me out like I was trash
For that you should be dead
But! But! But!
Then it hit me like a flash
What if high school went away instead?
Those assholes are the key
They're keeping you away from me
They made you blind, messed up your mind
But I can sеt you free!

You left me and I fell apart
I punchеd the wall and cried
Bam! Bam! Bam!
Then I found you changed my heart
And set loose all this truthful shit inside
And so I built a bomb
Tonight our school is Vietnam
Let's guarantee they'll never see their senior prom!
You might also likeI was meant to be yours
We were meant to be one
Don't give up on me now
Finish what we've begun
I was meant to be yours

So when the high school gym goes, boom!
With everyone inside
Pkhw! Pkhw! Pkhw!
In the rubble of their tomb
We'll plant this note explaining why they died!

[J.D. & STUDENTS, spoken]
We, the students of Westerberg High
Will die
Our burnt bodies may finally get through
To you
Your society churns out slaves and blanks
No thanks
Signed, the students of Westerburg High
Goodbye

[J.D.]
We'll watch the smoke pour out the doors
Bring marshmallows
We'll make s'mores
We can smile and cuddle while the fire roars!
[J.D. & ENSEMBLE]
I was meant to be yours
We were meant to be one
I can't make it alone
Finish what we've begun!
You were meant to be mine
I am all that you need
You carved open my heart
Can't just leave me to bleed!

Veronica!
Open the—open the door, please
Veronica, open the door
Veronica, can we not fight anymore, please?
Can we not fight anymore?
Veronica, sure, you're scared
I've been there, I can set you free!
Veronica, don't make me come in there
I'm gonna count to three!
One!
Two! Fuck it!

[ENSEMBLE]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[J.D.]
No! God, no! Veronica!
Please, don't leave me alone
You were all I could trust
I can't do this alone
Still I will if I must!
[VERONICA'S MOTHER]
Veronica?
I made you a snack
Veronica?
