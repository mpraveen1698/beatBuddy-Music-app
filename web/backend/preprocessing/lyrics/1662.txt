2 ContributorsThe Diary of Jane - Single Version Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I had to, I would put myself right beside you
So, let me ask, would you like that?
Would you like that?
And I don't mind if you say this love is the last time
So, now I'll ask, do you like that?
Do you like that?
No!

[Chorus]
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So, tell me how it should be

[Verse 2]
Try to find out what makes you tick as I lie down
Sore and sick
Do you like that?
Do you like that?
There's a fine line between love and hate
And I don't mind, just let me say that I like that
I like that

[Chorus]
Something's getting in the way
Somеthing's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Janе
As I burn another page
As I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So, tell me how it should be

Desperate, I will crawl
Waiting for so long
No love, there is no love
Die for anyone
What have I become?!

[Chorus]
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page
As I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of JaneEmbed The Diary of Jane - Single Version Phobia (Clean Version) Breaking Benjamin metal
