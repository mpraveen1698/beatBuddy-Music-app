Louis Theroux, Duke & Jones
Jiggle, jiggle

[Chorus]
My money don't jiggle, jiggle, it folds
I like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me wanna dribble, dribble, you know?
Ridin' in my Fiat, you really have to see it
Six-feet-two in a compact, no slack
But luckily the seats go back
I got a knack to relax in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine

[Verse]
Shepherd's Bush, my compact push
Notting Hill Gate, my Fiat skate
With a crate of Cabernet, but not today
Because I gotta drive, I wanna stay alive
Not 'cause it's illicit, do I have to get explicit?
As a matter of fact, I sip on the yak
With Big and Reecе, two hundred diamonds in their piecе
I'm tryin' to get mine, so I can shine

[Refrain]
Jiggle, jiggle, I like to see you wiggle, wiggle
Jiggle, jiggle, I like to see you wiggle, wiggle
You might also like[Chorus]
My money don't jiggle, jiggle, it folds
I like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me wanna dribble, dribble, you know?
Ridin' in my Fiat, you really have to see it
Six-feet-two in a compact, no slack
But luckily the seats go back
I got a knack to relax in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine

[Outro]
I think that went really well, don't you?
I enjoyed it, nice being in the booth
So unless you have anything else, that's a wrap
(Jiggle, jiggle, I like to see you wiggle, wiggle)
(Jiggle, jiggle, I like to see you wiggle, wiggle)1Embed Jiggle Jiggle Jiggle Jiggle Duke & Jones;Louis Theroux dance
