9 ContributorsStupid Feelings Lyrics[Verse 1]
So tired of adrenaline
Fake love on the internet
Why do I always come back again?
Every time I'm feeling low
Why do I self-medicate?
Drunk texts that I can't take back
Yeah, my heart's seen better days
But I call back anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know how to fall for somebody else
I wanna be what you need
I've got all my emotions stuck on the shelf
It's like I'm losing a part of me

[Chorus]
For you, it's easy to hurt my stupid feelings
But when you keep on leaving
Don't tell me everything is said and done
'Cause I hate it, lonely is overratеd
I'm over feeling faded
So sick of falling in and out of love

[Post-Chorus]
Falling in and out of lovе
Falling in and out of love

I wish I could let you know
Every time that I wanna go out
Always end up staying home
Because I got you on my mind
And I wish I could change it
Getting used to the wasted nights
Yeah, my heart's seen better days
But you broke it anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know how to fall for somebody else
I wanna be what you need
I've got all my emotions stuck on the shelf
It's like I'm losing a part of me

[Chorus]
For you, it's easy to hurt my stupid feelings
But when you keep on leaving
Don't tell me everything is said and done
'Cause I hate it, lonely is overrated
I'm over feeling faded
So sick of falling in and out of love

[Post-Chorus]
Falling in and out of love
Falling in and out of love
I don't know how to fall for somebody else
I wanna be what you need
I've got all my emotions stuck on the shelf
It's like I'm losing a part of me
[Outro]
For you, it's easy to hurt my stupid feelings
But when you keep on leaving
Don't tell me everything is said and done
'Cause I hate it, lonely is overrated
I'm over feeling faded
So sick of falling in and out of love3Embed Stupid Feelings Stupid Feelings 220 KID;LANY house
