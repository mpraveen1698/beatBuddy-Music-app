Stressed out
Feelin' lost and I don't know what to do now
What I chose ain't really gonna work out
Fallin' six feet underneath the floor now
Think I'm gonna tap out (Ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel bad, go to bed
Wake up even worse, yeah
So sad, in my head
Feelin' like a curse
I need medicine, medicine, medicine

[Chorus]
All my skeletons out for the taking (Ooh-ahh)
Yeah, I don't even know if I'ma make it
I'm afraid of myself and I hate it (Ooh-ahh)
All my skeletons out for the taking
Somebody take 'em

[Verse 2]
I wanna run away
The day to day is taking its toll on me
And I'm tearin' at the seams (Ooh-ahh)
Throw it all away
Give a fuck about what they say
I gotta disagree
This ain't really fun for me

Yeah, I don't even know if I'ma make it
I'm afraid of myself and I hate it (Ooh-ahh)
