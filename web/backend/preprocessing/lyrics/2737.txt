25 ContributorsWish You Were Here Lyrics[Verse 1]
I dig my toes into the sand
The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket
I lean against the wind, pretend that I am weightless
And in this moment I am happy, happy

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
I lay my head onto the sand
The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it
I'm counting UFOs, I signal them with my lighter
And in this moment I am happy, happy

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Wish you were here

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, woah-oh
The world's a roller coaster and I am not strapped in
Maybe I should hold with care, but my hands are busy in the air saying

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
