1 ContributorCall Me Back Lyrics[Chorus]
Call me back (call me back)
Tell me what the fuck is that
Show me how to fucking relax
I've been doing well baby you don't even gotta ask
No text but you sending me snaps like damn (damn)
Damn (yeah)
I wish I had another chance
Make me wanna collapse
Got me looking for paths
Looking at me from a glance
What the fuck is that
I don't wanna fucking relapse (yeah)
I don't wanna go back to the man that I was (naw)
Before we met
Reset
But I'm better than that
I'm finally growing from the past
But this time it'll last
Hoping that I do it and I get back on the track
I just wanna listen baby so call me fucking back (yeah)
Yeah just call me fucking back (yeah)

[Verse 1]
I'm a different man
I'm just trynna lend a hand to myself
Been a while but it's part of the help
To me it's more important than wealth
How the fuck can you be happy if you never fucking figure it out
I'm trynna shut out the mind
When I'm having trouble trynna unwind
But it's part of the grind yeah
Moving forwards cause I'm moving with time
Yeah I'm not a fucking child
I'm controlling my mind yeah
I'm finally taking control
I'm in the cooler four damn nights and it's taking a toll
What's the role in my life when I'm always trynna reach another goal
Yeah the nights get cold when I'm all alone (yeah)
I don't wanna be on my own
But I know I gotta be on my own
I gotta grow
Fuck a punch line
I don't wanna be like everybody in the lunch line
Set me apart and show me how to get to the sunshine

Got me looking for paths
Looking at me from a glance

[Verse 2]
Call me
Just call me
Pick it up baby
I don't give a fuck what you're doing
I've been spending every fucking day working on myself and improving
I'm proving to myself that I'm better than I was
I don't have the courage when I'm off of the buzz to tell you everything I wanna say and it sucks
I can feel the flood coming baby
I don't wanna stay in my rut
Too long I've been stuck in a rut
Tell me
Who the fuck is gonna care if I'm gone
I'm running outta time and I don't know if I keep being this strong
Baby I don't wanna fucking belong
I gotta do what I want but is that what I need
I'm sick of trusting all these people and then watching them leave (yeah)
It's a type of pain that I never dreamed
I just wanna fucking believe
That I'm a better person and I think it's achieved
Call me
Call me
