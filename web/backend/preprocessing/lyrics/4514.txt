Yeah, nah, n-nah, nah, nah
Yeah, nah, n-nah, nah, nah
Nah, n-nah, nah, nah
Yeah, nah, n-nah, nah, nah
Ya, yeah
I said world overran by the demons and monsters
Yeah, nah, nah

[Chorus]
World over ran by the demons and monsters
People in charge are just really the robbers
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
Lost in my head, yeah my thoughts always wander
Lost in my head, yeah my thoughts always wander
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
People in charge are just really the robbers
World overran by the demons and monsters

World overran by the demons and monsters
People in charge are just really the robbers
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
Lost in my head, yeah, my thoughts always wander
World overran by the demons and monsters
People in charge are just really the robbers
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
Lost in my head, yeah, my thoughts always wander

Chasing these demons, I'm wastin' my time
Voices are chattin' inside of my mind
Baby, I love you, but don't text my line
You just distract me when I'm tryna shine
Clueless to people that causin' me pain
Losin' myself, yeah, I'm mentally drained
And you brought me sun whenever it rained
And now you're a stranger I see random days
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah
You got me runnin' in circles
Scribbles inside of my journal
Your beauty is more than external
But you got me jumpin' these hurdles

[Pre-Chorus]
World overran by the demons and monsters (Yuh)
People in charge are just really the robbers (Ayy)
Fall into evil corrupt for the dollars (Ayy)
Lost in my head, yeah, my thoughts always wander (I'm sayin')

[Chorus]
World overran by the demons and monsters
People in charge are just really the robbers
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
Lost in my head, yeah, my thoughts always wander
World overran by the demons and monsters
People in charge are just really the robbers
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
Lost in my head, yeah, my thoughts always wander
[Verse 2]
Smokin' green and doin' pottery to get into the lottery
No money but the property of simple piece of poverty
We all need some modesty, equal forms of quantity
And I might cause a robbery
To steal back all the ease of mind that's taken by society
I'ma need sobriety
Addicted to the things that ran me down, man, what an irony
But I won't suffer silently, building up this rivalry
Cuttin' out the toxic people, smiling, like, "Finally, they gone"

[Bridge]
All of my thoughts gonna wander, yeah
Lost in a search for a dollar, yeah
The good people turn into robbers, and
I'm hiding from demons and monsters, and

[Outro]
World overran by the demons and monsters
People in charge are just really the robbers
Fall into evil, corrupt for the dollars
Lost in my head, yeah, my thoughts always wander8Embed Demons and Monsters Demons and Monsters 347aidan sad
