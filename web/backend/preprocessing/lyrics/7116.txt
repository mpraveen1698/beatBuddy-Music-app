Ayy, uh-huh
Yeah, I'm a bad boy doin' good things
Got a lemonade whip, chicken wings
With a bad bitch and she quite thick
So I might just cop myself a chain tonight
Slim shawty with the tank top
I'ma let her munch it on my cake pop, yeah-yeah
Yung Bae'll make your hips drop
So I might just take your woman for a night

[Pre-Chorus: bbno$]
Everybody in the whole building
I said, everybody in the whole building
Come on, follow along, feel the groove
And get yourself to move
Get your ass to the dance floor
I said, get your ass to the dance floor
Come on, follow along, feel the groove
Yeah, there's no one to prove

[Chorus: bbno$]
Pick a girl, pick a boy
Spin 'em 'round like a toy
Grab 'em hands, pull 'em close
Push 'em back, do the most (I said)
Pick a girl (Come on), pick a boy (Come on)
Spin 'em 'round (Come on) like a toy (I said)
Grab 'em hands (Come on), pull 'em close (Come on, all y'all)
Push 'em back (Come on), do the most (Let's go)

Panamera whip on the side
Damn, I'm looking fly
​bbno$, Yung Bae, we on fire
Thirty minute hits, yeah, why would I lie?
Pop all night, we pacify
Crazy bad girls in my sight, think I need to try
Confidence is peaking, I'm a really nice guy
Asked that fine lady, "Yo, girlie, wanna jive?"
Can't you feel these sparks ignite?

[Pre-Chorus: bbno$]
Everybody in the whole building
I said, everybody in the whole building
Come on, follow along, feel the groove
And get yourself to move
Get your ass to the dance floor
I said, get your ass to the dance floor
Come on, follow along, feel the groove
Yeah, there's no one to prove

[Chorus: bbno$]
Pick a girl, pick a boy
Spin 'em 'round like a toy
Grab 'em hands, pull 'em close
Push 'em back, do the most (I said)
Pick a girl (Come on), pick a boy (Come on)
Spin 'em 'round (Come on) like a toy (I said)
Grab 'em hands (Come on), pull 'em close (Come on, all y'all)
Push 'em back (Come on), do the most (Let's go)
[Post-Chorus: bbno$ & Billy Marchiafava]
Pick a girl (Come on), pick a boy (Come on)
Spin 'em 'round (Come on) like a toy (I said)
Grab 'em hands (Come on), pull 'em close (Come on)
Push 'em back (Come on), do the most (Billy)

[Verse 3: Billy Marchiafava]
Bring a girl, she my world
Got her dancin', come on, make her twirl
I've been doin' things all y'all couldn't dream of (Yeah)
I just made another song for the people (Ayy)
Dancin' (Oh), romancin' (Yeah)
Turned up, blacked out in a mansion (Hey)
Got the money, so the drinks on me (Yeah)
Got the honey, so the bees on me
Drip like a faucet, yeah, Billy saucing
Three gold chains keep me cold, Steve Austin (Ice)
And I'm lit, don't care about tomorrow
Me and a couple girls headed to the condo (Yeah)
​bbno$ got the bag
And Yung Bae chillin', he been runnin' up the bands
Flexed on my ex, got me feeling like the man
And all I ever do is drop hits, that's the plan
