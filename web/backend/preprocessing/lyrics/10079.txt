1 ContributorBe My One LyricsWant you to say (yea, yea)
Want you to say (yea, yea)

[Verse 1]
What if I told you, you could have my heart
Would it be enough, would it be enough? (No)
Imagine love that never falls apart
Could it be us, could it be us?

[Pre-Chorus]
Want you to say, yea, yea, I want you to
Want you to say, yea, yea, I want you to
Want you to say, yea, yea, I want you to
Want you to say, yea, yea, I want you to

[Chorus]
Could you be my one?
Could you be my one, my one, my one?
You showed how to love when I found it's so hard to fall
This must be real 'cuz I have never felt this way before
Could you be my one?
Could you be my one, my one, my one?
You showed how to love when I found it's so hard to fall
This must be real 'cuz I have never felt this way before
Could you be my one?
