Show me how you care
Tell me how you were loved before
Show me how you smile
Tell me why your hands are cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me how

[Chorus]
I’m turning around, I’m having visions of you
But then I understand
The friend I’m dreaming of is far away
But I’m here, I’m here

[Verse 2]
Show me how you’re proud
Tell me how you reach the moon
My thoughts err away tonight
My heart fell to love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me how

[Chorus]
I’m turning around, I’m having visions of you
But then I understand
The friend I’m dreaming of is far away
And doesn’t feel my love
But I do, I doYou might also like31Embed Show Me How Show Me How Men I Trust indie
