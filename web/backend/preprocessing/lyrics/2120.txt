I'm a little bit off today, somethin' down inside me's different
Woke up a little off today, I can tell that somethin's wrong
I'm a little thrown off today, there's something going on inside me
I'm a little bit off today, a little bit off today

[Refrain]
(I'm a little bit off today, a little bit off)

[Verse 2]
See, I'm a little bit off today, I cannot put my finger on it
Got up a little off today, just to play that same old song
I don't really wanna try today, I see nothing in my reflection
I'm a little bit dry today, feel like I could die today

[Refrain]
(I'm a little bit off today)
Feel like I could die today

[Chorus]
Hey-ey yeah, hey-ey yeah
Hey-ey yeah, don't you know? (I'm a little bit off)
Hey-ey yeah, hey-ey yeah
Hey-ey, you gotta let it go (I'm a little, just a little bit off)

[Verse 3]
I'm a little pissed off today and there ain't nothin' you can do about it
I'm a little put off today and I could not tell you why
Got a really short fuse today, everyone around me's fucking crazy
I'm a little ticked off today, a little pissed off today

(I'm a little bit off today, off)

[Verse 4]
I told a little white lie today, I smiled and told someone I loved them
I had to say goodbye today to someone that I love
I couldn't even cry today, I think my heart is finally broken
Didn't need a reason why today, I don't need a reason why today

[Chorus]
Hey-ey yeah, hey-ey yeah
Hey-ey yeah, don't you know? (I'm a little bit off)
Hey-ey yeah, hey-ey yeah
Hey-ey, you gotta let it go (I'm a little, just a little bit off)

[Bridge]
I got a little too high today, got lost inside a sea of madness
Crashed a little bit hard today, crashed a little too hard today
Everybody sing

[Chorus]
Hey-ey yeah, hey-ey yeah
Hey-ey yeah, don't you know? (I'm a little bit off)
Hey-ey yeah, hey-ey yeah
Hey-ey, you gotta let it go (I'm a little, just a little bit off)
Hey-ey, you gotta let it go (I'm a little, just a little bit off)
[Outro]
I'm a little bit off today
Somethin' down inside me feels so different
Just a little bit off today
You can all fuck off today9Embed A Little Bit Off F8 Five Finger Death Punch groove
