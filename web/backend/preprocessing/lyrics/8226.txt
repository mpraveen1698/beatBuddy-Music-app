13 ContributorsOut of Control Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've done everything as you say
I've followed your rules without question
I thought it would help me see things clearly
But instead of helping me to see
I look around and it's like I'm blinded

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control

[Chorus]
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
I don't understand what you want from me

[Verse 2]
I feel like I'm spinning out of control
Try to focus but everything's twisted
And all along I thought you would be there
To let me know I'm not alone
But in fact that's exactly what I was

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
You might also like[Chorus]
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
Or all of the things you've said to me

[Bridge]
I may never know the answer
To this endless mystery
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me

[Interlude]
Is it a mystery? Is it a mystery?
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
Spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control

[Chorus]
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
Or all the things you've said to me
[Outro]
And I may never know the answer
To this endless mystery
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control1Embed Out Of Control The Reason (15th Anniversary Deluxe) Hoobastank grunge
