Never was an early riser, used to bein' up all-nighter
Never saw the mornin' light quite like I do now
Never said no to a party, never started savin' money
But everything is different since you've been around

[Chorus]
It's the way you're smilin' at me, it's in the way you hold my hand
It's the way I've watched you change me from a boy into a man
It's a million things about you, and I don't know what it is
But I have never known a love like this

[Verse 2]
Never used to get excited to sit here in the silence
Holdin' on to somethin' the way I'm holdin' you
Didn't used to know how fast time walks and runs and flies by
I never thought I'd feel so deeply, but damn, I do

[Chorus]
It's the way you're smilin' at me, it's in the way you hold my hand
It's the way I've watched you change me from a boy into a man
It's a million things about you, and I don't know what it is
But I have never known a love like this

[Bridge]
It's funny how everything I dreamed about
Starts to seem so empty without you

It's the way you're smilin' at me, it's in the way you hold my hand
It's the way I've watched you change me from a boy into a man
It's a million things about you, and I don't know what it is
But I have never known a love like this
I have never known a love like this3Embed Love Like This Magic Ben Rector acoustic
