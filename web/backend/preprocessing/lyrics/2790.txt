We used to hide under the covers
Serenade each other
With careless melodies
Something buried deep inside us
The major and the minor
We're like piano keys

[Chorus]
You played for me
You played for me, oh-oh
You played for me
I swear it, even in my sleep
I hear it like the memory
Of everything we used to be
You played for me

[Drop]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You played for me
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You played for me

[Verse 2]
We couldn't stop the world from turning
It was like a whirlwind
Scattered us like leaves
But I'm stuck inside a feeling
The song that never leaves
We were like a symphony

You played for me
You played for me, oh-oh
You played for me
I swear it, even in my sleep
I hear it like the memory
Of everything we used to be
You played for me

[Drop]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You played for me
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You played for me

[Bridge]
You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
You played for me

[Drop]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
[Chorus]
I swear it, even in my sleep
I hear it like the memory
Of everything we used to be
You played for me6Embed Play Play K-391;Alan Walker;Tungevaag;Mangoo house
