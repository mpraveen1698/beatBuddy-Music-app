So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

[Verse 1]
Drop dead
A bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes
Have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me

[Chorus]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

[Verse 2]
Ignorance
And understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding?
How far
Will we take this?
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe

[Bridge]
This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this
Is worthless
Tell me (tell me, tell me)
So
What have we done
With a war that can't be won?
This can't be real
'Cause I don't know what to feel, no

[Chorus]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
For this world to believe15Embed Still Waiting Does This Look Infected? Sum 41 punk
