Somebody runnin' through the field
Somebody shoulda stayed home
Somebody pickin' up the body of somebody they were gettin' to know
Somebody lackin' in desire
The type you just don't fuck
A supreme gentleman with a gun in his hand lo-lo-lo-lookin' for somebody to love

[Chorus]
Lookin' for somebody to love
Lookin' for somebody to love

[Verse 2]
I wanna show him he's a bitch
I wanna fuck him up good
I wanna smash the competition, go and kill it like a man should
"You gotta show me how to push if you don't want a shove"
Are the words of a young man already damned, lo-lo-lo-looking for somebody to love

[Chorus]
Lookin' for somebody to love
Lookin' for somеbody to love
Oh they ran, oh they ran
You should havе seen how they ran when I was lookin' for somebody to love
You should have seen it man, I was all bang, bang, bang, bang
Lookin' for somebody to love
Oh they ran, oh they ran
You should have seen how they ran when I was lookin' for somebody to love
You should have seen it man, I was all bang, bang, bang, bang
Lookin' for somebody to love

Somebody lyin' on the field
Somebody cryin' on the phone
Somebody pickin' up the body of somebody  they were gettin' to know
Maybe we're lackin' in desire
Maybe it's just all fucked
But the boy with the plan and a gun in his hand was lo-lo-lo-lookin' for somebody to love (Hey, yeah, woo)

[Chorus]
Lookin' for somebody to love
Lookin' for somebody to love
Oh they ran, oh they ran
You should have seen how they ran when I was lookin' for somebody to love
You should have seen it man, I was all bang, bang, bang, bang
Lookin' for somebody to love
Lookin' for somebody to love
