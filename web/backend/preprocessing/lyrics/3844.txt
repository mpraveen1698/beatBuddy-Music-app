Two, three, four
(Woohoo, woohoo)
(Woohoo, woohoo)

[Verse 1]
Well, my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
(Woohoo, woohoo)
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
(Woohoo, woohoo)
I felt a little fear upon my back
I said, "Don't look back, just keep on walking"
(Woohoo, woohoo)
Well, the big black horse said, "Look this way"
He said, "Hey lil' lady, will you marry me?"

[Chorus]
But I said, "No no, no no no no"
I said, "No no"
You're not the one for me"
No no, no no no no
I said, "No no, you're not the one for me
Ooh, woohoo

And my heart had a problem in the early hours
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two
(Woohoo, woohoo)
But I cut some cord and I shouldn't have done it
And it won't forgive me after all these years
(Woohoo, woohoo)
So I sent her to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
(Woohoo, woohoo)
Now it won't come back cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see, yeah
(Woohoo, woohoo)

[Chorus]
And it said, "No no, no no no no
I said, "No no
You're not the one for me"
No no, no no no no
I said, "No no, you're not the one for me"
Ooh, woohoo
(Not the one for me, yeah)
(Woohoo)

[Chorus]
I said, "No no no no, no no no
No, no
You're not the one for me" (Woohoo)
No no no no
No no
No no, you're not the one for me"
(Woohoo)
[Outro]
Big black horse and a cherry tree
(No no, no no no no)
I can't quite get there
'Cause my heart's forsaken me
Yeah, yeah, yeah (No no)
Big black horse and a cherry tree (No no, no no no no)
I can't quite get there cause my heart's forsaken me13Embed Black Horse And The Cherry Tree Eye To The Telescope KT Tunstall acoustic
