23 ContributorsOpera House Lyrics[Verse 1]
Built an opera house for you in the deepest jungle
And I walked across its stage, singing with my eyes closed
I've got a love for you I just can't escape
All of my love for you cuts me like barbed wire

[Chorus]
Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight

[Verse 2]
If I abandoned love, I'd be a man without dreams (ooh)
I'd rather be out there staring death right between its eyes now
And I can still hear the sound of you crying through the night
There in the opera house with no one else for miles

[Chorus]
Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight

[Outro]
Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sightSee Cigarettes After Sex LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like5Embed Opera House Cigarettes After Sex Cigarettes After Sex ambient
