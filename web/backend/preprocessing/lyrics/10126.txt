8 ContributorsKoop Island Blues Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hello, my love, it's getting cold on this island
I'm sad alone, I'm so sad on my own
The truth is we were much too young
Now I'm looking for you, or anyone like you

[Verse 2]
We said goodbye with a smile on our faces
Now you're alone, you're so sad on your own
The truth is we ran out of time
Now you're looking for me, or anyone like me

[Interlude]
Na na na, na na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Hello, my love, it's getting cold on this island
I'm sad alone, I'm so sad on my own
