I tell myself you don't mean a thing
And what we got got no hold on me
But when you're not there, I just crumble
I tell myself I don't care that much
But I feel like I die 'till I feel your touch

[Chorus]
Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this

[Verse 2]
Say I wouldn't care if you walked away (Oh)
But every time you're there I'm begging you to stay
When you come close (When you come close), I just tremble
And every time, every time you go (Oh)
It's like a knife that cuts right to my soul

[Chorus]
Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burning to my skin
Only love can hurt like this

Only love can hurt like this (Uh-uh)

[Chorus]
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burning to my skin
Only love can hurt like this
(Only love can hurt like this)
Only love can hurt like this
(Only love can hurt)
