[Verse 1]
Conversion, software version 7.0
Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub

[Pre-Chorus]
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

[Verse 2]
More wood for their fires, loud neighbors
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck

[Pre-Chorus]
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder
