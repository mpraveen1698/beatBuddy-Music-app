Are from the start
The chosen few
Out of the youth
Are from the start
Oh I’ll lie with you
Out in the dew

[Verse 2]
Intimacy
Real love true
Regarding a deal
Is it really true
I love you
Is it really you?
Cause I
Have some news for you

[Pre-Chorus]
You
Will you ever preserve
Will you ever exhume?
Will you watch petals shed
From flowers in bloom?

[Chorus]
Nothing can live up to promise
Nothing can stop its narrative
Nothing in place of catalysts
And you'll never be pure again
