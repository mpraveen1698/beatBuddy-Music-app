Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Save up all the days
A routine malaise
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay

[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Would you always? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Maybe sometimes? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Make it easy? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take your time (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Think of all the ways
Momentary phase
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay
You might also like[Verse 3]
Every time you try
Quarter half a mile
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay (Oh-oh-oh)

Would you always? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Maybe sometimes? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Make it easy? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take your time (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Would you always? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Maybe sometimes? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Make it easy? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take your time (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
