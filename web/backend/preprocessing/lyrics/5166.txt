1 ContributorFeel This Way LyricsStare out the window, window
I could not sleep
And if you draw this, draw this
Yeah it was bittersweet

And I was lost in space
Lonely without air
If you could hear me, hear me
I'll wait for you there

The places that I go
When I'm feeling that I'm low
Oh places that are known
It's when I'm on my own

I don't know why I feel this way
I don't know why to feel this way
I don't know why I feel this way, Oh well

I don't know why I feel this way
I don't know why to feel this way
I don't know why I feel this way, Oh well

There's too much love here
Too much in this house
And when the fall comes
Why do I feel this way?
You might also likeAnd I was lost in space
Lonely without air
If you could hear me, hear me
I'll wait for you there

The places that I go
When I'm feeling that I'm low
Oh places that are known
It's when I'm on my own

I don't know why I feel this way
I don't know why to feel this way
I don't know why I feel this way, Oh well

I don't know why I feel this way
I don't know why to feel this way
I don't know why I feel this way, Oh wellEmbed Feel This Way Feel This Way Lonely in the Rain;Panama french
