Hey, baby, kiss the goat
Woah, kiss, kiss, kiss the go-goat

[Verse: Papa Nihil]
You've been playing around the magic that is black
But all the powerful magical mysteries never gave a single thing back
You've been daddied by all the dudes that wanna dad
And all those dads never gave you the things that you should've had

[Chorus: Papa Nihil]
It ain't always what it seems when you cling onto a dream
It ain't always there to please you (Please you)
But he's the guy you wanna do and you know that it takes two
Luckily he wants to do you too
Satan, Lucifer
Osculum obscenum

[Refrain: Papa Nihil]
Hey, baby, kiss the goat
Oh, kiss, kiss, kiss the go-goat
Hey, baby, hey, hey, hey, kiss the goat
Oh, kiss, kiss, kiss the go-goat

[Chorus: Papa Nihil]
It ain't always what it seems that glitter wasn't gold
As opposed to what they told you (Told you)
But he's the guy you wanna do and you know that it takes two
Luckily he wants to do you too
Satan, Lucifer
Osculum obscenum
