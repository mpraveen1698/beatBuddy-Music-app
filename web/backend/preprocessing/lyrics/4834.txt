10 ContributorsLift Off Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, my heart will always be with my home
'Cause home’s the only place got my heart
But something lit a fire in my soul
Voyager gon' voyage
I (I) got somethin' that’s gon' take me somewhere (Somewhere)
Take me up into the stratosphere
This is goodbye until we meet again (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Again, woo!

[Pre-Chorus]
I could tell you I'm sorry
But you know I won't mean it when you hear me say
Feelin' like King T'Challa
'Bout to go Clark Kent, and up, up and away
Baby, I don't wanna break your heart
But this is where I belong
World’s ready for a superstar
I got my engines on

[Chorus]
Lift off
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, gone
You see my rocket ship
Head up in the clouds
When the spaceship lit, ignite
Hit me from the ground
I’m about to lift off
Five, four, three, two, one
You see the shuttle is shootin' up to Mars
’Bout to land on Venus
Baby, I'm a star
Watch a boy go lift off
You might also like[Verse 2]
Look, all this shit is holdin' me back (Ah)
Bonnie and Clyde, 'bout to go ahead and kill that (Ah)
Sorry to the people I thought I love, I think I found my soulmate
And we’re goin' all the way, as high as that cocaine, so

[Pre-Chorus]
This is probably gonna break your heart (Your heart)
But this is where I belong (Ah)
World's ready for a superstar (Ah)
I got my engines on

[Chorus]
Lift off
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, gone
You see my rocket ship
Head up in the clouds
When the spaceship lit, ignite
Hit me from the ground
I'm about to lift off
Five, four, three, two, one
You see the shuttle is shootin' up to Mars
'Bout to land on Venus
Baby, I'm a star
Watch your boy go lift off
[Outro]
Three, two, one
Baby, I'm a star
Watch your boy go lift offEmbed Lift Off Lift Off Labrinth indie-pop
