40 ContributorsDonâ€™t Know Why Lyrics[Verse 1]
I waited 'til I saw the sun
I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

[Verse 2]
When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

[Refrain]
My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever
[Verse 3]
Out across the endless sea
I will die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

[Refrain]
My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever

[Verse 4]
Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum

[Outro]
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come14Embed Don't Know Why Come Away With Me (Super Deluxe Edition) Norah Jones jazz
