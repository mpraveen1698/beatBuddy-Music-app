[Verse 1]
Yo, excuse me, beg your pardon girl
Do you have any idea what you starting girl
You got me tingling, come to me mingling
Steppin’ off lookin' bootylicious and jingling
Whеn you walk, I see it baby girl
When you talk, I believе it baby girl
I like that, thick-petite n' pretty
Little touch is a ditty
Love to work the kitty like...

Girl, I must say you the flyest thang in here
You’re so hot we gon’ need some rain in here
Type to make ex-gangstas bang in here
Girl you could do anything you want in here
Clown if you want to, frown if you want to
You ain't even gotta drop down if you want to
’Cause I'd rather see you shake it standin'
Either way you do it girl you look outstandin'
