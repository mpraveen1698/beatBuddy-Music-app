Walk in like a wrecking ball
The way she move makes you miserable
All eyes on the golden girl
She's gonna tell ya, gonna tell ya
Gonna tell ya that you're too sweet
Swan dive to the concrete floor
The pavement never felt so warm
One look and you already know
She's gonna cut ya, gonna cut ya
Gonna cut ya, cut ya real deep

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm freaking out
Lay it on me
Anything you want

[Chorus]
You can crash my car tonight
Go out, wasting all my time and money (Money)
I love the way you're breaking my heart
And I can't stand to see you leaving lonely

[Post-Chorus]
I'll drive you home at the end of the night
I'll drive you home at the end of the night

Dead last as a drama queen
But I found myself in the front seat of her car
She's bad blood royalty, but that's fine
Yeah, that's alright with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm freaking out
Lay it on me
Light me up and lay me down
And love me like you shouldn't now

[Chorus]
You can crash my car tonight
Go out, wasting all my time and money (Money)
I love the way you're breaking my heart
And I can't stand to see you leaving lonely (Lonely)

[Post-Chorus]
I'll drive you home at the end of the night
I'll drive you home at the end of the night

[Chorus]
You can crash my car tonight
Go out, wasting all my time and money
I love the way you're breaking my heart
And I can't stand to see you leaving lonely (Lonely)
[Outro]
Crash my car, take all my money and run
Baby, if that's what you want
Lonely, lonely
Crash my car, take all my money and run
Baby, if that's what you want
Lonely, lonely8Embed Crash My Car Dreamland COIN indie-pop
