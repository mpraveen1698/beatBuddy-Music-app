Ritual union's got me in trouble again
I was wondering of a white dress
And the mistress and a spirit holding my hand

[Verse 1]
Love is sinking in the sand
Petals falling on demand
My feet are running like the wind
I'm sorry, boy, that we sinned
Love is not like they say
A lie, that it's hard to make it stay
I drown my feelings in the sea
They dried out over on the beach

[Chorus]
Ritual union's got me in trouble again
I was wondering of a white dress
And the mistress and a spirit holding my hand

[Verse 2]
Mother, tell me how it is
I know you've been through all of this
You ran away so many times
Your kids, your heart, a couple of dimes
Love is not like they say
A lie, that it's hard to make it stay
I drowns my feelings in the sea
They dried out over on the beach
You might also like[Chorus]
Ritual union's got me in trouble again
I was wondering of a white dress
And the mistress and a spirit holding my hand
Ritual union's got me in trouble again
I was wondering of a white dress
And the mistress and a spirit holding my hand11Embed Ritual Union Ritual Union Little Dragon trip-hop
