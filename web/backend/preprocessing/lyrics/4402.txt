28 ContributorsMemory Lyrics[Intro]
Shit don't matter we're just walking through a memory
Doo doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Baby I'm nauseous
Baby you caused this
It's all for me
Doo, doo, doo, doo, walking through the straight line

[Verse 1: Rxseboy]
You've been stuck in my head and girl I really wanna talk now
Chill at your place but every day you would walk out
Uh, kept cool can we calm down, anger in flames, slapped in the face with your palm
I don't know what to do and it's late and I'm tired
And you're on my mind, take a hit to feel higher
Text you again when I'm feeling inspired
I've recognized I'm reigniting the fire
Ay, what you want to do with me
I heard you telling everybody that you cool with me
But like you never text back
Every night relapse on the pain but you never let your parents see that
Now you stuck in a cycle of fuck-ups and jealousy
In my livestream, hit me up just to yell at me
Wow, think of the times you were hesitant
Thoughts about me, hope you know they're indefinite

[Bridge]
Shit don't matter we're just walking through a memory
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Baby I'm nauseous
Baby you caused this
It's all for me
Doo, doo, doo, doo, walking through the straight line

For anybody that's wondering what my mind is
That shit's just solitary confinement
Open-minded, but my mind's been lost
And I'm really just trying to find it
Yeah we're magnets just trying to manage attraction
Damage and shattered to fragments
Love like a spiral I'm just trying to catch it
But I guess I suck and I just need some practice
And I'm wishing I could rip you out  my head like my hair
Yeah, If I was dead would you even care
If I had a funeral would you be there
Sometimes I wonder what colors you'd wear
Would you move on and tell yourself that you're strong
While you let me fade as I'm dead and I'm gone
Will you hold it down 'til you meet me and God
Or love someone else and leave me to be lost
I thought for life meant for life until momma remarried three times
I never saw through the lines
Growing up I thought that life would be fine
Now I'm just watching as everything dies

[Outro]
Baby you caused this
It's all for me
Doo, doo, doo, doo, walking through the straight line
Shit don't matter we're just walking through a memory
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Baby I'm nauseous
Baby you caused this
It's all for me
Doo, doo, doo, doo, walking through the straight...21Embed Memory Memory Promoting Sounds;Rxseboy;SadBoyProlific sad
