9 ContributorsBOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE Lyrics[Verse 1]
I stand still
Ain't no wind's gon' blow me down
I drink my swill
Hold my hand until we drown
And I know it's easier
To keep things in than saying them out loud
I'm used to being hurt
Drink some gin, I try to keep it down
I think you know me too well
I just can't say I know myself
I know I put you through hell
And if I leave all by myself, you'd be just fine

[Chorus]
But I'm lost, where do I go?
I can't find my way back home
I'll die on my own
Searching for someone I know
Long roads stare at me
Hope the distance sets me free
I'm tired, but I stand strong
Ain't much time before I'm gone

[Verse 2]
I stand still
Take my soul, set it on fire
But I can't feel
No one hears me whеn I cry
And I know it's easier
To let it all comе crashing to the ground
I think I'm being cursed
To take all that I love and burn it down
I know I'm drinking too much
And if it kills me, then I'm dead
I don't got time to lose much
And if I lose to my own head, just let me go
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I'm lost, where do I go?
I can't find my way back home
I'll die on my own
Searching for someone I know
Long roads stare at me
Hope the distance sets me free
I'm tired, but I stand strong
Ain't much time before I'm gone1Embed BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE MIXED EMOTIONS Jack Kays sad
