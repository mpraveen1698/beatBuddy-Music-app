When you came to me with your bad dreams and your fears
It was easy to see that you'd been crying
Seems like everywhere you turn catastrophe reigns
But who really profits from the dying?

[Chorus]
I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you forever
I could hold you in my arms, oh
I could hold you forever

[Verse 2]
When you kissed my lips with my mouth so full of questions
My worried mind that you quiet
Place your hands on my face
Close my eyes and say
That love is a poor man's food
Don't prophesize

[Chorus]
I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you forever
And I could hold you in my arms, oh
I could hold you forever
You might also like[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
So now we see how it is
This fist begets the spear
Weapons of war
Symptoms of madness
Don't let your eyes refuse to see
Don't let your ears refuse to hear
Or you ain't never going to shake this sense of sadness

[Chorus]
I could hold you in my arms
I could hold on forever
And I could hold you in my arms, oh
I could hold on foreverEmbed Hold You in My Arms Trouble Ray LaMontagne acoustic
