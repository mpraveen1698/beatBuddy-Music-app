Wan' tell you a story, 'bout a woman I know
Ah, come to loving, she steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty, ain't exactly small
Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six, you could say she's got it all

[Verse 1]
Never had a woman, never had a woman like you
Doin' all the things, doin' all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story, ain't no skin and bones
But you give it all you got weighing in at nineteen stone

[Chorus]
You're a whole lotta woman, a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie, whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie and you're a whole lotta woman

[Verse 2]
Oh, honey, you can do it, do it to me all night long
Only one that turn me, only one that turn me on
All through the night time and right around the clock
Woo, to my surprise, Rosie never stopped

[Chorus]
She was a whole lotta woman, whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie, whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie, a whole lotta woman, yeah-yeah-yeah
