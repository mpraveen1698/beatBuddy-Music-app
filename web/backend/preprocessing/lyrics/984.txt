Yeah

[Verse 1]
Why you callin' at 11:30
When you only wanna do me dirty?
But I hit right back
'Cause you got that-that, yeah
Why you always wanna act like lovers
But you never wanna be each others'?
I say, "Don't look back"
But I go right back and

[Pre-Chorus]
All the sudden, I'm hypnotized
You're the one that I can't deny
Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away

[Chorus]
You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
Now, I don't wanna fight this (No)
You know how to just make me want
You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
You got me in a tight grip (Yeah)
You know how to just make me want you, baby

But you never wanna be each others'
I say, "Don't look back"
But I go right back and
