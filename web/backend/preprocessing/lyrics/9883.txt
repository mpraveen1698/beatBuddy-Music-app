1st Class Musiq
Them love chat, them no run them block
Run them block, 1st Class
Outside with half-dozen gunman ready fi do the action
(Them love chat, them no run them block)
Run them block
Diemon, we no do the long chat
Know weh them a do, 'cause we a flick them bat
Spain Town, my town, everything well shot

[Verse 1: Tommy Lee Sparta & Skeng]
Them nah run them block (Hey, boy)
When we pull up, them haffi run, left that (Gunman)
Nine ball in a the clip, compact
Me dark like [?] so me fly them bat
Protocol, we have hundred strap
Molly get pop, whole place get hot
Rinse out everything out a the Glock
Hollow point that a lodge up in a boy head back
A short man with a tall mini 'K in a shorts
Rolex watch 'pon me hand
Rich and bad
Change the running board 'pon the Taurus, and it a old one
The Ruger clip compact
Head buss like ball them drop
Take on any rocky road, the Benz no wan' shock
Empty the clip in a them head and drive off fast
