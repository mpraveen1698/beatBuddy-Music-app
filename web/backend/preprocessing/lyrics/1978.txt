And be my mistake
Then turn out the light
She bought me those jeans
The ones you like
I don't wanna hug
I just wanna sleep
The smell of your hair
Reminds me of her feet

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes

[Chorus]
Save all the jokes you're gonna make
While I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake

[Verse 2]
I shouldn't have called
'Cause we shouldn't speak
You do make me hard
But she makes me weak
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes

[Chorus]
And save all the jokes you're gonna make
While I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake47Embed Be My Mistake A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships The 1975 rock
