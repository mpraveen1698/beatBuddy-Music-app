6 ContributorsTalk About It Lyrics[Verse 1]
Back when I spent my love on you
Woke up in the middle of the afternoon
I said, "Hey, we can do anything"
Or we can talk about it all night
End of the night, I'm lost in you
My last cigarette, I gave to you
You said, "Hey, we can do anything"
Or we can talk about it all night
But we won't talk about it all night

[Chorus]
'Cause when I talk about you
I never feel sorry
When I'm with you
Oh baby, don't worry
I don't need to tell you
That you got me now
'Cause we can
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
'Cause we can
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na

[Verse 2]
Tell me a lie, I'll make it true
Tell me who touches you the way I do
I said, "Hey, we can do anything"
Or we can talk about it all night
But we won't talk about it all night

[Chorus]
'Cause when I talk about you
I never feel sorry
When I'm with you
Oh baby, don't worry
I don't need to tell you
That you got me now
'Cause we can
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
'Cause we can
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na

[Break]
[Bridge]
Talk to me
I promise you will
Let me be
The one who
Sets you free
And we can
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
And we can
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na

[Chorus]
'Cause when I talk about you
I never feel sorry
When I'm with you
Oh baby, don't worry
I don't need to tell you
That you got me now
'Cause we can
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
'Cause we can
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
