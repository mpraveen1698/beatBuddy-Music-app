26 ContributorsEasy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, you heard
What they say
Oh, the more things change
The more they stay the same
Ain't that a shame? (I know it's a shame)
I've been good
For some time
I'd be lying if I said that
You ain't on my mind
Been tryin' to give it some time

[Pre-Chorus]
Feelin' like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say

[Chorus]
I can say that loving you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way
I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
Try to understand

Mornin' sun, mornin' high
Oh, I think this haze is, for now, my best disguise
No need to think about why
Whatcha say, starry-eyed
How you love to smile
And watch the clouds reside
Just tryin' to give it some time

[Pre-Chorus]
Feelin' like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say

[Chorus]
I can say that loving you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way
I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
Try to understand
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
Try to understand
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
Try to understand
I can say that loving you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way
I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
