You know I got your number, number all night
I'm always on your team, I got your back, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if he treats you right
I wanna put you into the spotlight

[Pre-Chorus]
If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right

[Chorus]
I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

[Verse 2]
Call you up, you've been crying, crying all night
You're only disappointed in yourself, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if it treats you right
I wanna take you into the sunlight

[Pre-Chorus]
If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right
