Wake up alone
In the morning
With no one at my side
Could it be
I've waited too long?
Waiting for the lucky one

[Chorus: Los Retros]
My sweetheart
Where are you?
I need someone to spend time with
To give and share all my love

[Verse 2: Firelordmelissa]
Back in bed
It's 3 A.M.Â 
With no one at my side
It gets real cold
Because these blankets
Will never warm my heart

[Chorus: Firelordmelissa, Los Retros & Both]
My sweetheart
Where are you?
I need someone to spend time with
To give and share all my love
My sweetheart
Where are you?
I need someone to spend time with
To give and share all my love
