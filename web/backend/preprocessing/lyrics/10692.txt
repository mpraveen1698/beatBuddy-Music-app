1 ContributorSo What Lyrics[Verse 1]
Losing signal, losing people
Soon be single if I keep up with this guise, with this guise
Drinking bottle after bottle
Hoping that would solve the problems
In my mind, in my mind

[Chorus]
So what? So what? So what?
We keep on falling for one thing, well
So what? So what? So what?
'Cause in the morning, we're nothing, well
So what?

[Verse 2]
I'll be dancing, taking chances
There's no time for second glances
In this room, in this room
Spending money, I'm not sorry
I just wanna move my fancy
Close to you, close to you, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
So what? So what? So what?
We keep on falling for one thing, well
So what? So what? So what?
'Cause in the morning, we're nothing, well
So what?You might also likeEmbed So What So What Jay Pryor groove
