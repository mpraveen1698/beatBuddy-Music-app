3 ContributorsDonâ€™t Talk Lyrics[Verse 1]
My heads too cloudy I've been tryna clear it up (Tryna clear it up)
I'm gettin' dizzy, I can't straighten out my thoughts (Straighten out my thoughts)
I know that I need help but
Nobody wants to hear that
I'm off the deep end and you're wavin' from the top

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that's the place that I go, oh
It's the only way that I know, oh
Shh

[Chorus]
Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk, leave me alone, alone
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop me if you know, that you know
I gotta do it in the moment, super focus
I'ma hit you right back when the feelings gone (Oh, oh)
Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk, leave me alone
Alone, alone, alone

[Verse 2]
Don't bother callin', busy talkin' to my walls (Talkin' to my walls)
Posters applaudin' all my solo monologues (Solo monologues)
I'm all alone so often
And I know I'm better off
Better without these problems
But I just can't seem to stop
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You know that's the place that I go, oh
It's the only way that I know, oh
Shh

[Chorus]
Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk, leave me alone, alone
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop me if you know, that you know
I gotta do it in the moment, super focus
I'ma hit you right back when the feelings gone (Oh, oh)
Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk, leave me alone
Alone, alone, alone

[Outro]
Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, aloneEmbed Don't Talk Don't Talk MASN emo
