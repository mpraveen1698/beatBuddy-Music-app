15 ContributorsCHARGER (Charli XCX Rework) Lyrics[Verse 1: ELIO]
God, that's so classic
I'm three precent away from bein' stranded
The way I left was way too cinematic
The realization hadn't even landed
God fuckin' dammit

[Pre-Chorus: ELIO]
Don't wanna be put back, back in a moment where
I'd wanna change my own mind
Already got my bags, already cleared the air
Do I even need it that bad?

[Chorus: ELIO]
And I wanna come back
'Cause I left my, left my, left my charger
(But) I don't wanna go back
It'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
Should be by the bedside and, if I'm right, on the left side, yеah
(But) That'll make it, make it, make it, makе it harder

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
One thing linkin' me to you
Plugged in, waitin' in your room
I left just a piece of me there
Text sent, but you left me on read
I wish I could tell it straight
No games, lookin' at your face
I left a piece of my heart there
I wish I never cared, yeah

Don't wanna be put back, back in a moment where
I'd wanna change my own mind, yeah
Already got my bags, already cleared the air
Do I even need it that bad? No

[Chorus: Charli XCX & ELIO]
And I wanna come back
'Cause I left my, left my, left my charger
I don't wanna go back
It'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
Should be by the bedside and, if I'm right, on the left side, yeah
(But) That'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
And I wanna come back
'Cause I left my, left my, left my charger
I don't wanna go back
It'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
Should be by the bedside and, if I'm right, on the left side, yeah
But that'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder

[Outro: ELIO]
And if I'm gonna go back
Would you make it, make it harder?
'Cause I don't wanna go back
To the moment when I left and how it started
And I think this was a sign
But if you're fine, it don't feel right, yeah
'Cause it'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder5Embed CHARGER (ft. Charli XCX) ELIO and Friends : The Remixes ELIO;Charli XCX indie-pop
