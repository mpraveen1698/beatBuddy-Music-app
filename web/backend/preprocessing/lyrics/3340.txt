2 ContributorsLet It Rain Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
I won't fight it
Won't try to deny that this is who I am
I can't hide it
I won't turn to a lie, so unlike me

[Pre-Chorus]
Here's to the tears
To the pain that I feel, let it wash away
To all of my sins
The mistakes and the wins, I am not afraid
Let it rain down, cover my bones
Dancing with the light, lights over me
Night, night's pulling me close
Pour it all out
Dancing with the light, lights over me

[Chorus]
Let it rain down
Let it rain down
Let it rain down
Dancing with the light, lights over me
Let it rain down

[Verse 2]
I am grounded
Was lost, but I found that this is who I am
I'm a mountain, there is no way around me
Now I see
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Here's to the tears
To the pain that I feel, let it wash away
To all of my sins
Thе mistakes and the wins, I am not afraid
Let it rain down, covеr my bones
Dancing with the light, lights over me
Night, night's pulling me close
Pour it all out
Dancing with the light, lights over me

[Chorus]
Let it rain down
Let it rain down
Let it rain down
Dancing with the light, lights over me
Let it rain down, cover my bones
Dancing with the light, lights over me
Night, night's pulling me close
Pour it all out
Dancing with the light, lights over me
