Is my love too much?
Or is it just enough for you, for you?
'Cause it's getting late, would you like to stay? Ah
'Cause I'm bad at reading signs

[Pre-Chorus]
But I, I wanna do whatever you wanna do
If you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind

[Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause feelings are hard to find
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Feelings are hard

[Verse 2]
But I feel 'em in my chest
A tiny war within
But when I pull you closer
Girl, I can't explain

[Bridge]
And I know, and I know that it hurts sometimes
That it hurts sometimes when I'm with you
And I know, and I know that it hurts sometimes
That it hurts sometimes, but I miss you
And I know, and I know that it's on your mind
That it's on your mind when I kiss you
But I wanna do whatever you wanna do

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna do whatever you wanna do
If you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind
[Chorus]
