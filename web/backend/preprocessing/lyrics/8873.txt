2 ContributorsHush Hush (Don’t Be Shy) Lyrics[Verse 1]
My vision's blurry and I'm looking for a bottle
To keep me up so I don't trip and hit the bottom
I'm always looking for a different kinda party
If it's not you then I'm not leaving with nobody

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, you're looking at me looking at you
Ah, yeah, it's your move, now what you gon' do?

[Chorus]
Hush, hush, don't be shy
Let's do it like there's no tomorrow
Taste like cherry wine, please take me back to your nirvana
Baby, don't be shy
Put my heart in overdrive, yeah
One-two-three-four-five, take me back to your nirvana

[Post-Chorus]
(Hush, hush, don't be shy)
Let's do it like there's no tomorrow
(Taste like cherry wine)
Plеase take me back to your nirvana
Baby, don't bе shy
Put my heart in overdrive, yeah
One-two-three-four-five, take me back to your nirvana

Yeah, I'm addicted to a certain kind of drama
Don't make it easy no I'm no prima donna
I want that twisted kinda love, it hits me different
If it ain't broke then I don't see no need to fix it

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, you're looking at me looking at you
Ah, yeah, it's your move, now what you gon' do?

[Chorus]
Hush, hush, don't be shy
Let's do it like there's no tomorrow
Taste like cherry wine, please take me back to your nirvana
Baby, don't be shy
Put my heart in overdrive, yeah
One-two-three-four-five, take me back to your nirvana

[Post-Chorus]
(Hush, hush, don't be shy)
Let's do it like there's no tomorrow
(Taste like cherry wine)
Please take me back to your nirvana
Baby, don't be shy
Put my heart in overdrive, yeah
One-two-three-four-five, take me back to your nirvana
[Outro]
One-two-three-four-five
You're looking at me looking at you
Take me back to your nirvanaEmbed Hush Hush (Don't Be Shy) Hush Hush (Don't Be Shy) Anthony Keyrouz;ZANA electronic
