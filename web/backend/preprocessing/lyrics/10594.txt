3 ContributorsBlack (Live MTV Unplugged) Lyrics[Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
Lay spread out before me as her body once did, mm
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun, yeah
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
Mm, and all I taught her was everything (that's all folks)
Mm, how quick the sun can drop away

[Chorus]
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything

[Verse 2]
I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play, ooh
I can feel their laughter, oh so why do I sear
Mm, and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning, how quick the sun can drop away

[Chorus]
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything

All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll be, yeah
Mhm, mhm, ooh

[Bridge]
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky, but why
Why, why can't it be, oh, can't it be mine?
Mm, no yeah, no yeah

[Outro]
