36 ContributorsSteady, as She Goes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Find yourself a girl and settle down
Live a simple life in a quiet town

[Refrain]
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes

[Verse 2]
Your friends have shown a kink in the single life
You've had too much to think, now you need a wife

[Refrain]
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)

[Chorus]
Well here we go again
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well
But no matter what you do
You'll always feel as though you tripped and fell

[Refrain]
So steady as she goes

When you have completed what you thought you had to do
And your blood's depleted to the point of stable glue
Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along

[Refrain]
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)

[Chorus]
Well here we go again
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well
But no matter what you do
You'll always feel as though you tripped and fell

[Refrain]
So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes

[Bridge]
Settle for a world, neither up or down
(Settle for a world, neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd that has gathered 'round
(Sell it to the crowd that has gathered 'round)
Settle for a girl, neither up or down
(Settle for a girl, neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd that has gathered 'round
(Sell it to the crowd that has gathered 'round)
[Refrain]
So steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)

[Outro]
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
