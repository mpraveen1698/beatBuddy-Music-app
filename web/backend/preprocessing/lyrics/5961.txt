1 ContributorGo West Lyrics[Introduction]
Uh
Uh
Let's Go

[Verse 1: Nat Anglin]

I think I'm leaving
I'm getting up outta here
No fucks given
Fresh up outta fear
Gone
Love me or leave me alone
Respected and protected
Always reppin' my home
I mean
Who rep harder than me?
Turn ya doubts to my dreams
Take them farther than me?
I'm a starter you dweebs
And I ain't got the time
To go and tip toe the lines
Never be a martyr for the
Nope
Fistful of dreams, glass full of Honey Jack
Visualizations sit back let the money stack
Where I'm from? I get plenty of hate
So it's no wonder why I had to plan the escape. I'm out
You might also like[Chorus: Nat Anglin]

I think I'm leaving
I'm getting up outta here
No fucks given
Fresh up outta fear
I think I'm leaving
This time I gotta go
I'll be back one day you already know
I think I'm leaving
I'm getting up outta here
First time in awhile I'm seeing things clear
And if you can't respect that
Ya whole perspective is whack
Maybe they'll love me when I fade to black

[Verse 2: Nat Anglin]

Back home, everyone bout' to blow next
Fuck this
I'll take my talents and Go West
Yes, the 'king of wishful thinking'
Maybe get a job, a place, and try to stop drinking, syke!
Just pour another glass
Start tomorrow instead
Maybe take another pass
That's just me
You know
Tryna break free
Of feeling proud and annoyed
Simultaneously
Watch, listen
I been around like a sting
Dudes frontin' over nothing
Whats a pawn to a king?
Or what's a queen to a pawn
Tryna hold my yawns
Beantown state of mind
Where the trees are palm
They
Show you slugs before they show hugs
Never shown shit, now I gotta show love!?
Times changing
It's like I'm riding in Deloreans
I hope you fare well
Like a Valedictorian
