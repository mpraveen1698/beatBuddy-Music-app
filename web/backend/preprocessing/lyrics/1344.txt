La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
We could do this all night
We could see the sunrise
Oh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
This is what it feels like
Fallin' for the first time
Oh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's lose control from our head to our toes
No, you don't have to be alone
Look at the time, tell me, where did it go?
I don't wanna go home

[Chorus]
We'll be dancin' to Nirvana, moonlight leads the way
I hear a thousand songs, but you're the only melody
If we're dancin' 'til tomorrow, need you next to me
I hear a thousand songs, but you're the only melody

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la

[Chorus]
We'll bе dancin' to Nirvana, moonlight leads the way
I hear a thousand songs, but you'rе the only melody
If we're dancin' 'til tomorrow, need you next to me
I hear a thousand songs, but you're the only melody

[Verse 2]
Whisper to me real slow
I don't wanna let go
Oh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
You're just what I'm into
Help me sing it in tune
Oh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's lose control from our head to our toes
No, you don't have to be alone
Look at the time, tell me, where did it go?
I don't wanna go home
[Chorus]
We'll be dancin' to Nirvana, moonlight leads the way
I hear a thousand songs, but you're the only melody
If we're dancin' 'til tomorrow, need you next to me
I hear a thousand songs, but you're the only melody

[Post-Chorus]

We'll be dancin' to Nirvana, moonlight leads the way
I hear a thousand songs, but you're the only melody
If we're dancin' 'til tomorrow, need you next to me
I hear a thousand songs, but you're the only melody
